# TODOLIST
- ***"get_services"***
    - Add manual retrieval of CVE data from Exploit DB (local repository needs to be available)
    - Check if order of URL provided by Google API is the same every time
    - Benchmark how many URLs does the LLM need to check for a given CVE to get the GT services, do it just for one CVE, it is a useful result for the thesis
- ***"test_code"***
    - Assess if it works correctly using the Dockers from VDaaS
    - Implement "scratchpad" from which the LLM can memorise previous fix attempts
    - Use MAVEN to assess if CVE is present in Docker (look at what Docker Desktop can do)
    - Implement MAVEN for vulnerability assessment
    - Implement MCP for Docker Desktop in another branch
- Expand logging:
    - Create log for code
    - Create log for conversation history
- Problems discovered with testing:
    - Some non-vulnerable service version are reported as vulnerable (e.g. CVE-2021-28164)
    - Launching the docker of CVE-2024-23897 requires root privileges to perform certain commands, might want to check security
    - Manually forcing the Docker to stop (e.g. CVE-2022-46169) is seen as a potential issue by LLM which tries to solve the problem, even though the containers seem to work fine, might be related to having multiple active containers 
- Benchmark with accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, input/output tokens and costs the results of the 3 web search modes (use 100 CVEs, extract them from VDaaS), actually need to check if query of 'custom' mode is =CVE-ID, then there is no need to perform benchmark with 'custom_no_tool'
- **Implement LLM-as-a-judge**: invoke LLM to check if generated code has the correct versions provided by the web search, may require expanding the **CodeGenerationResult**
- Review checks for 'AUX' services
- **Test the web search benchmark**
