- ***"get_services"***
    - (Prof. Giordano suggestion) Add a specific web search to check if the 'MAIN' service requires some specific 'AUX' services to work (e.g. check 3 web pages) &rarr; might require adjusting _WebSearchResult_, evaluate if a prompt variation for current web search solution is sufficient
    -  (Ask prof. Drago) Add manual retrieval of CVE data from local repository of Exploit DB
- ***"assess_services"***
    - (Prof. Giordano suggestion) If assessment fails in any milestone, retry performing the web search up to 3 times until all milestones are passed &rarr; requires loop implementation and graph modification
- ***"generate_code"***: COMPLETED
- ***"save_code"***: COMPLETED
- ***"test_code"***
    - Use MAVEN to assess if CVE is present in Docker (look at what Docker Desktop can do)
- **Generic**
    - Implement MCP for Docker Desktop in another branch for future proofing
    - Review logging for graph history (a.k.a. _final\_report_)
- **Problems discovered with testing**:
