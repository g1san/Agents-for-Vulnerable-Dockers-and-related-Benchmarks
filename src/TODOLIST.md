# TODOLIST
- ***"get_cve_id"***: COMPLETED
- ***"assess_cve_id"***: COMPLETED
- ***"get_services"***
    - (**DONE**) Limit the number of web pages analysed (e.g. to 5) &rarr; modify tool so that it is possible to specify the number of pages to search (up to 10)
    - Add a specific web search to check if the 'MAIN' service requires some specific 'AUX' services to work (e.g. check 3 web pages) &rarr; might require adjusting _WebSearchResult_, evaluate if a prompt variation for current web search solution is sufficient
    -  (Ask prof. Drago) Add manual retrieval of CVE data from local repository of Exploit DB
    - Measure how many URLs does the LLM need to check for a given CVE to get the right service list, do it just for one CVE, it is a useful result for the thesis
    - Check if order of URL provided by Google API is the same every time
- ***"assess_services"***
    - If assessment fails in any milestone, retry performing the web search up to 3 times until all milestones are passed &rarr; requires loop implementation and graph modification
- ***"generate_code"***: COMPLETED
- ***"save_code"***: COMPLETED
- ***"test_code"***
    - Decide the maximum number of iterations in the loop (currently set to 10)
    - Implement "scratchpad" from which the LLM can memorise previous fix attempts
    - Use MAVEN to assess if CVE is present in Docker (look at what Docker Desktop can do)
    - Implement LLM-as-a-judge: invoke LLM to check if generated code uses the correct service versions provided by the web search &rarr; may require expanding the _CodeGenerationResult_
    - Review logging for code
    - Assess if it works correctly using the Dockers from VDaaS
- **Generic**
    - Keep going with the benchmarks using the web search results saved in _'web_search_benchmark_logs'_
    - Evaluate a change from _bool_ to _float_ for some milestones
    - Implement MCP for Docker Desktop in another branch for future proofing
    - Review logging for graph history (a.k.a. _final\_report_)
- **Problems discovered with testing**:
    - Some non-vulnerable service version are reported as vulnerable (e.g. CVE-2021-28164)
    - Launching the docker of CVE-2024-23897 requires root privileges to perform certain commands, might want to check security
    - Manually forcing the Docker to stop (e.g. CVE-2022-46169) is seen as a potential issue by LLM which tries to solve the problem, even though the containers seem to work fine, might be related to having multiple active containers
