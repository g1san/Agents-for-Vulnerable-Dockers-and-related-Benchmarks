## 4 Thesis
Revisione manauale 6th-bs e 7th-bs di GPT-4o
### Boffa Says
**Best web search mode**: fare più run per CVE per ogni WSM usando SOLO GPT-4o. OBBIETTIVO: scegli la migliore WSM per gli step di analisi successivi. SOLUZIONE: usare i risultati di 5th-bs, 6th-bs e 7th-bs
**Docker generation**: usando più modelli e la miglior WSM, fare le run (1 o più?) sulle 20 CVE. OBBIETTIVO: raccogliere metriche (e.g. milestones, costo, numero iterazioni, etc.)
**Vuln Ass**: VA per le 20 CVEs, statica e dinamica

### Giordano Says
Cerca di capire come mai alcuni risultati sbagliati della web search portano alla creazione di docker funzionanti

### Drago Says
Testa altri modelli


### LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
 See here https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/llm_judge
 The idea is, use the usual 20 CVE and analyse the results manually, create a dataset about the milestones a human user would have assigned and then confront it with the milestones generated by the LLM


### More stats
- Most frequently used services both HARD and SOFT dependencies &rarr; _web\_search\_result.json_ can be used to compute these stats
- Most frequent cause of error during testing (linked to specific service or programming language?) &rarr; _final\_report.txt.json_ can be used to compute these stats
- Number of lines of code of each file produced as a solution by the LLM (consider only CVEs or which all LLMs produced a working solution) &rarr; files can be used to compute these stats

## Future Works
- Implement MCP for Docker Desktop in another branch for future proofing
- Implement RAG for fixes, instead of passing entire list, ask LLM to summarise the fix list and pass summary instead
- Fully implement the **_run\_exploit_** node function: launch the PoC for the specific CVE, extract the output, pass it to an LLM-as-a-Judge and evaluate if the output is the desired one (might want to pass the code of the exploit) or if there is a problem with either the docker or the exploit code. All exploits must be tested on a working Docker and adapted to the **_run\_exploit_** function, so that they can be launched after performing _chmod +x_
