    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability in PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, specifically when configured as a CGI script (php-cgi). The issue arises from improper handling of query strings that lack an equals sign, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by inserting command-line options into the query string. This vulnerability is related to the failure to skip a certain php_getopt for the 'd' case.",
