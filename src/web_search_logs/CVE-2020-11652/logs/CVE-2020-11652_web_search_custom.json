    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability in SaltStack, a configuration management tool, affecting Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal sequences in the ClearFuncs class of the salt-master process, allowing unauthorized access to the file system of the Salt master server. This can lead to remote code execution as attackers can read and write arbitrary files on the server without authentication.",
