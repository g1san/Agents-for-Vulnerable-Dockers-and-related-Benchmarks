    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty that allows sensitive file disclosure through path traversal. The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. It allows URIs crafted with encoded characters to access the WEB-INF directory, potentially exposing sensitive files like `web.xml`. The issue arises from Jetty's URI parsing, which allowed certain encodings to bypass security checks. The vulnerability has been addressed in later versions of Jetty.",
