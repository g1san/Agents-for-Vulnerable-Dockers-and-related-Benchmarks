    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below, allowing remote privilege escalation and remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability arises from an improperly secured default installation, where an attacker can gain admin privileges without authentication due to insecure default cookie values used for authentication between Erlang nodes. This issue is particularly relevant for systems where CouchDB is exposed on port 4369. To mitigate, users should update to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, set up a firewall, and ensure that the CouchDB distribution port is bound to localhost.",
