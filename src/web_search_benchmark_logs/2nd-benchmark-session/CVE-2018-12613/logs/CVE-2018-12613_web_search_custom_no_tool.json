    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, which allows for Local File Inclusion (LFI) and potentially remote code execution. The vulnerability arises from improper whitelisting of pages during redirection and loading processes, allowing an attacker to include and execute files on the server. This issue requires authentication, except when specific configuration settings are enabled, which can bypass authentication. The vulnerability has been resolved in version 4.8.2.",
