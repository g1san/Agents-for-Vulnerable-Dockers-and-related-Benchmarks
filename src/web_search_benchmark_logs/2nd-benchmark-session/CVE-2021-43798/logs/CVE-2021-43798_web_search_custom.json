    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a path traversal vulnerability in Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0, excluding patched releases. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access sensitive files on the server by exploiting the public API endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId`. Attackers can traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory, such as `/etc/passwd` or Grafana's configuration files. The vulnerability can be exploited using HTTP requests, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure, including database credentials and application logs. Remediation involves upgrading to patched Grafana versions (8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, or 8.3.1).",
