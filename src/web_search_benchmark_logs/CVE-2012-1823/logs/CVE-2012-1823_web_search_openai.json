    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability in PHP's CGI implementation, specifically in the `sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c` file. When PHP is configured to run as a CGI script (`php-cgi`), it improperly handles query strings that lack an equals sign (`=`). This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by injecting command-line options into the query string. The vulnerability affects PHP versions: 5.3.0 through 5.3.11 and 5.4.0 through 5.4.1.",
