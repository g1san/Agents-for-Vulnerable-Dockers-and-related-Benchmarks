    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Laravel framework, specifically affecting the Ignition component used for error display. The vulnerability arises from insecure usage of PHP functions `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()`, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely. It affects Laravel versions up to 8.4.2 and Ignition versions before 2.5.2 when debug mode is enabled. The CVSS v3 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity level. To mitigate, it is crucial to update Laravel and Ignition to the latest versions and disable debug mode in production environments.",
