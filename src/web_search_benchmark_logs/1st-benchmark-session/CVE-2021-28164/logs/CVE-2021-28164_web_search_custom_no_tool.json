    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty, a web server and servlet container, affecting versions 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. The vulnerability arises from the default compliance mode, which allows requests with URIs containing %2e or %2e%2e segments to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, such as web.xml, potentially exposing sensitive information about the web application's implementation. The issue is mitigated in versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6 by restoring previous defenses, including decoding URIs before normalization and rejecting ambiguous requests.",
