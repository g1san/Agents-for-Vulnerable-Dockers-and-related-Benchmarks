    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty that allows sensitive file disclosure through path traversal. The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. It allows URIs crafted with encoded characters to access the WEB-INF directory, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files. The issue arises from Jetty's URI parsing, which allowed certain encoded paths to bypass security checks. The vulnerability is mitigated in versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6.",
