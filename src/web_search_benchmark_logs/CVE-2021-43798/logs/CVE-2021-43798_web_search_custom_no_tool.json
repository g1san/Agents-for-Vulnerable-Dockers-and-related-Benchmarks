{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a path traversal vulnerability in Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access sensitive files on the server by exploiting the public API endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId`, which fails to properly sanitize user-provided file paths. The vulnerability can be exploited using HTTP requests, allowing attackers to traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory, such as `/etc/passwd` or Grafana's configuration files. The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning it can be executed without prior authentication to the Grafana instance. Affected installations should be upgraded to patched versions 8.3.1, 8.2.7, 8.1.8, or 8.0.7.",
