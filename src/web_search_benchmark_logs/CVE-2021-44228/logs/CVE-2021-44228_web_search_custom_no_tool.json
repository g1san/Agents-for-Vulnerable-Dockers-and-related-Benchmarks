    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228 is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0, excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. The vulnerability arises from the JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters, which do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI-related endpoints. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From version 2.15.0, this behavior is disabled by default, and from version 2.16.0, the functionality is completely removed. This issue is specific to log4j-core and does not affect other Apache Logging Services projects like log4net or log4cxx.",
