    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. It allows attackers to perform a path traversal attack, potentially accessing files outside the intended directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default \"require all denied\" configuration, the attack can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability does not affect versions prior to 2.4.49.",
