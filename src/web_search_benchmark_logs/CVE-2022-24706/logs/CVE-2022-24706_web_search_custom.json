    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. It allows remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting an improperly secured default installation, enabling attackers to gain admin privileges without authentication. The vulnerability arises from the use of a default cookie value for authentication between Erlang nodes, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code remotely. To mitigate this, users should update to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or higher and follow security guidelines such as setting up a firewall and binding the CouchDB distribution port to localhost.",
