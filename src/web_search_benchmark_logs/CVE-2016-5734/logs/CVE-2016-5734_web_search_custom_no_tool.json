    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, a popular web-based database management tool, affecting versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The issue arises from improper delimiter selection, which fails to prevent the use of the preg_replace 'e' (eval) modifier. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code through a crafted string, particularly in the table search-and-replace functionality. The vulnerability is critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8, and can be exploited without authentication. Users are advised to update to a patched version of phpMyAdmin to mitigate this security risk.",
