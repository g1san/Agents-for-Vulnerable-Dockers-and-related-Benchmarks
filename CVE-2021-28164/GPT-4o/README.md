**NOTE**: _DOckerfile\_og_ is the original output of the GPT-4o model, however Docker could not retrieve the _Jetty_ image specified in the **FROM**. Therefore a supplementary prompt was added in order to make the model correct its mistake (see _Dockerfile_).

**TAKEAWAY**: if the model is able to test the container, it can autonomously check for errors and repair them.
