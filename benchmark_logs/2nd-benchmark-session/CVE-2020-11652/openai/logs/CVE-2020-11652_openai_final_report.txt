Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Docker Compose setup attempts to create two different services (salt-master and salt-minion) with the same image tag 'saltstack/salt:2019.2.3-CVE-2020-11652'. Docker does not allow two images with the same name and tag to be created from different builds. This results in a conflict when attempting to export the second image.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we can use different image tags for the salt-master and salt-minion services. This will ensure that each service can be built and tagged independently without causing a conflict. We will update the docker-compose.yml file to use different tags for each service.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means no containers are being inspected. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain if Docker containers are running correctly, if they are using the specified 'saltstack/salt' service, or if the service version is 2019.2.3. Without logs or container data, none of the goals can be confirmed.
	Error: The Docker system terminates due to a lack of logs and container inspection data, suggesting a potential misconfiguration in the Docker Compose setup or Dockerfiles, preventing the containers from starting correctly.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the Docker Compose file and Dockerfiles are correctly set up without build conflicts, and ensure that the image tags are consistently applied. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfiles are correctly configured to copy necessary configuration files and that the services are properly defined in the Docker Compose file.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided from the 'docker inspect' command are empty, which means there is no information available to verify if the Docker containers are running correctly, if the 'saltstack/salt' service is being used, or if the version of 'saltstack/salt' is 2019.2.3. Without this information, none of the goals can be confirmed as achieved.
	Error: The Docker Compose setup is not correctly configured to ensure that the salt-master and salt-minion services are running as expected. The main issue could be related to improper configuration of the Dockerfiles and the absence of necessary configurations in the docker-compose.yml, leading to empty logs.
	Fix: The solution involves correcting the Docker Compose setup by ensuring that the Docker Compose file is properly configured to use the correct image tags and that the Dockerfiles are correctly set up to copy the necessary configuration files. Additionally, ensure that the services are properly defined in the Docker Compose file to facilitate communication between the salt-master and salt-minion services.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, therefore it is not possible to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if they use the correct version of 'saltstack/salt'.
	Error: The Docker system terminates because the 'saltstack/salt' images specified in the docker-compose.yml file do not exist with the given tags '2019.2.3-CVE-2020-11652-master' and '2019.2.3-CVE-2020-11652-minion'. Additionally, there is no explicit network defined, which might cause communication issues between containers.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to use the correct image tags for the 'saltstack/salt' service. Since the specified tags are incorrect, we will use the available '2019.2.3' version with the 'CVE-2020-11652' tag. We will also define a network to ensure proper communication between the salt-master and salt-minion services.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The provided logs are empty, hence it is impossible to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if the correct version of 'saltstack/salt' is being used.
	Error: The Docker system terminates without logs, making it difficult to diagnose the issue. The configuration might have issues related to volume mounting or service dependencies.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the paths for volume mounting are correct and that the services are properly configured to communicate over the defined network. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfiles correctly copy configuration files and use the appropriate entry points.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information to verify if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if they use the correct version of 'saltstack/salt'. Without logs, none of the goals can be assessed or achieved.
	Error: The Docker Compose setup fails to start due to empty logs, which might be caused by misconfiguration or missing elements in the Docker setup. The lack of logs suggests that the containers might not be starting correctly, or they might not be able to communicate with each other as expected.
	Fix: To address the issue, ensure that the Docker Compose file is correctly configured, including proper volume mounting, network configuration, and service dependencies. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfiles are correctly set up to use the necessary configuration files and that the services are properly defined to enable communication between the salt-master and salt-minion services. In the Docker Compose setup, ensure that the environment variable for the salt-minion is correctly set to point to the salt-master, and ensure that the logging level is properly configured to capture logs.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' in the Docker Compose logs indicates a YAML syntax issue, likely due to improper indentation or formatting in the 'docker-compose.yml' file. YAML is sensitive to spaces and indentation, which can lead to parsing errors if not properly formatted.
	Fix: The fix involves correcting the YAML syntax in the 'docker-compose.yml' file. This includes ensuring proper indentation and spacing throughout the file. Additionally, I have verified that the configuration files and Dockerfiles are correctly set up to support the services.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The provided logs are empty, which indicates that there is no information available to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if they use the correct version of 'saltstack/salt'. Without any data, none of the goals can be assessed as achieved.
	Error: The Docker system was terminating due to potential misconfigurations in the Docker Compose setup, specifically related to network and volume configurations, as well as the absence of explicit versioning in the Dockerfile.
	Fix: The fix involved ensuring that the services are properly defined with explicit dependencies and network configurations, and the Dockerfiles are set up correctly to use the necessary configuration files. Additionally, the Docker Compose file was updated to ensure consistent image usage and correct volume mappings.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information available to verify if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if they are using the specified version of 'saltstack/salt'. Without any data, none of the goals can be assessed or achieved.
	Error: The Docker system terminates without logs, indicating potential issues with configuration or service startup. The absence of logs suggests that the services might not be starting correctly, possibly due to misconfigurations in the Docker Compose file or Dockerfiles.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the images are correctly specified, and the services are properly configured to start and communicate. Verify that the configuration files are correctly copied and used by the services. Update the Docker Compose file to ensure proper volume bindings and network configuration. Additionally, ensure that the configuration files are correctly placed and accessible within the containers.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The provided logs are empty, which indicates that there is no information available to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they are using the specified services, or if they are using the correct version of 'saltstack/salt'. Without any data, none of the goals can be assessed or achieved.
	Error: The Docker system is not starting because the images used in the Docker Compose file are not available or not configured correctly. The logs are empty, indicating that the containers might not be starting at all, possibly due to incorrect image specifications or configuration issues.
	Fix: To fix the problem, ensure that the images specified in the Docker Compose file are available and correctly configured. Use the specific '2019.2.3' version with the 'CVE-2020-11652' tag as required. Additionally, make sure that the configuration files are correctly copied into the containers and that the services can communicate over the defined network. Adjust the Docker Compose file and Dockerfiles to ensure proper setup and execution of the services.
