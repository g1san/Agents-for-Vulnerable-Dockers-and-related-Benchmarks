	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, so no information is available to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if the correct versions of 'saltstack/salt' are being used.
	Error: The Docker system terminates its execution likely due to a missing or misconfigured entrypoint script or configuration file, or due to incorrect volume mappings.
	Fix: The fix involves ensuring all necessary files are present, correctly configured, and executable. Additionally, the Docker Compose file is updated to ensure proper volume mapping and service configuration. The entrypoint script is modified to include debugging options to provide more detailed logs in case of further issues.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The provided logs are empty, so it is impossible to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if the specified services are being used, or if the correct version of 'saltstack/salt' is being used.
	Error: The Docker system terminates due to empty logs, making it difficult to determine if containers are running correctly or if the correct version of 'saltstack/salt' is being used.
	Fix: To address the issue, ensure the Docker Compose setup is correctly configured to capture logs and verify the correct setup of the Salt Master service. This involves ensuring that the logging configuration is correct, the volume paths are correctly specified, and the entrypoint script is correctly set to output logs to the specified log file. Additionally, ensure the Dockerfile and entrypoint script are correctly set up to start the Salt Master service with appropriate logging.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The provided logs are empty, so it is not possible to verify if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if they use the specified versions of 'saltstack/salt'.
	Error: The Docker system is not generating logs, likely due to incorrect volume mappings or misconfigured logging settings, preventing visibility into the container's operations. Additionally, the entrypoint script may not be correctly initiating the Salt Master service.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the volume mappings in the Docker Compose file are correctly set to store logs and configuration files. Update the entrypoint script to ensure that it correctly starts the Salt Master service and logs output to the specified log file. Additionally, verify that the Dockerfile correctly sets up the environment for the Salt Master service.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which prevents any analysis of the Docker containers' status, the services they use, or the versions of those services. Without logs, we cannot determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they are using the specified services, or if the correct versions of those services are in use.
	Error: The Docker system terminates due to empty logs, which indicates that the logging configuration might be incorrect or the Salt Master service is not starting properly. The entrypoint script and Dockerfile might not be properly set to capture or direct logs to the specified log file.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the logging configuration in Docker Compose is set correctly to capture logs. The entrypoint script should be modified to ensure logs are captured and directed to the specified log file. Additionally, ensure the Salt Master service is properly started in the entrypoint script with the correct logging options.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, therefore it is impossible to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they are using the specified services, or if the 'saltstack/salt' service is using the correct version.
	Error: The Docker system terminates execution due to an error in the logging configuration and possibly incorrect volume bindings. The logs are empty, which indicates that the logging path might not be correctly set up or accessible.
	Fix: To fix the issue, the logging configuration is updated to ensure that logs are captured correctly. The entrypoint script is modified to ensure that the Salt Master service starts with the correct logging options, and the Docker Compose file is updated to ensure that volume paths are correctly specified and accessible. Additionally, the Dockerfile is updated to ensure that all necessary files are present and correctly configured.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' indicates a syntax error in the YAML file, specifically in the docker-compose.yml file. This error is typically caused by incorrect indentation or misplaced colons, which are critical in YAML formatting.
	Fix: The fix involves correcting the YAML syntax in the docker-compose.yml file by ensuring proper indentation and placement of colons. Additionally, ensure that the YAML file is formatted correctly to prevent such errors.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, indicating that there are no running Docker containers to inspect. Therefore, it's impossible to verify if the Docker containers are running correctly, if they use the specified services, or if they use the correct versions of 'saltstack/salt'.
	Error: The Docker system fails to start due to missing files in the build context and incorrect volume setup, which prevents the Salt Master service from initializing properly.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that all necessary files are present in the build context and correctly configured. Add the missing 'master.conf' and 'entrypoint.sh' files to the 'salt-master' directory. Update the Docker Compose file to ensure the volume mappings are correct and accessible. Also, ensure the entrypoint script starts the Salt Master service correctly and logs output to the specified log file.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information to assess whether the Docker containers are running correctly, whether the specified services are being used, or if the correct version of 'saltstack/salt' is being utilized.
	Error: The error stems from the Docker Compose configuration not properly setting up the environment for the Salt Master service, specifically related to the handling of logs and permissions.
	Fix: To address the issue, ensure that the volume mappings are correctly set up and that the entrypoint script starts the Salt Master service with the correct permissions. Additionally, ensure that the log file is correctly set up to capture logs from the Salt Master service. This involves updating the Docker Compose file to use a compatible logging driver and ensuring that the entrypoint script correctly initializes the service and logs.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information to assess whether the Docker containers are running correctly, whether they use the specified services, or whether they use the correct version of 'saltstack/salt'. Without log data, none of the goals can be confirmed.
	Error: The Docker system terminates due to a lack of log output and potential misconfigurations in the Docker Compose setup. The logs are empty, indicating that the Salt Master service might not be starting correctly or that logs are not being captured as intended. Potential issues could include incorrect volume mappings, incorrect file paths, or permission issues preventing the Salt Master service from starting or writing logs.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the entrypoint script correctly initializes the Salt Master service and that logs are captured. Adjust the Docker Compose file to ensure proper volume mappings and permissions. Additionally, ensure that the Salt Master service is started with the correct options in the entrypoint script, and that logs are directed to the specified log file. This involves verifying volume paths, ensuring necessary directories and files exist, and setting appropriate permissions.
