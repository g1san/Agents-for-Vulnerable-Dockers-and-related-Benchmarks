Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly: The container with ID 'e9aae35fa7a8becf7729808268e777608530b444aa07aa0384b6181935c188c7' has a status of 'exited', and 'Running' is false with an 'ExitCode' of 1, indicating an error occurred during startup.

2. Services are correctly identified: The Docker configuration includes the 'httpd' service, which matches the provided list of services.

3. The 'httpd' version is within the specified range: The 'HTTPD_VERSION' is '2.4.49', which is within the range '2.4.49---2.4.50'.
	Error: The Docker container exits with code 1, indicating a failure during startup. The issue is likely related to the Apache HTTP Server configuration or the Dockerfile setup, particularly with the version of the httpd image or the configuration files.
	Fix: To address the issue, the HTTPD version should be updated to 2.4.50, which is still within the allowed range. Additionally, ensure that the CGI script has the correct permissions and that the configuration files are properly set up. The Dockerfile should explicitly set the executable permission for the CGI script, and the httpd.conf file should correctly configure the CGI directory.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly as the container has a status of 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during execution.
2. The required service 'debian' is not present in the logs; only 'httpd' is mentioned.
3. The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The Docker system terminates execution due to the absence of the 'debian' service, which is required as an auxiliary service to provide the operating system environment for running the Apache HTTP Server. Additionally, the exit code 1 indicates a failure during the execution of the container, potentially due to misconfiguration or missing dependencies.
	Fix: To fix the issue, add a 'debian' service to the docker-compose.yml file to provide the necessary environment for the 'httpd' service. Ensure that both services are correctly defined and can communicate if needed. Additionally, verify that all necessary files are in place and correctly configured to avoid execution errors.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs**: The Docker container is not running correctly since its 'State' indicates 'Status': 'exited' and 'Running': false.

2. **Services Ok**: The logs only provide information about an 'httpd' service and there is no mention of a 'debian' service, failing to meet the requirement of having both 'httpd' and 'debian'.

3. **Code Main Version**: The 'httpd' version used is 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The Docker system terminates its execution because the 'debian' service is not running any commands, leading to an exited state immediately after starting. Moreover, the 'httpd' service is dependent on 'debian', causing the 'httpd' service to not run correctly if 'debian' is not active.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the 'debian' service runs a command to keep it active. We will modify the 'docker-compose.yml' to include a simple command like 'tail -f /dev/null' for the 'debian' service to keep it running. Additionally, ensure that the 'httpd' service is configured correctly to run independently of the 'debian' service's exit state.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running Correctly: The `debian` container is running correctly, but the `httpd` container is not running. It exited with a non-zero exit code (1), indicating an error during startup.

2. Services Used: The logs show that both `debian` and `httpd` services are present, matching the required services.

3. Version of 'httpd': The `httpd` service uses version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range (2.4.49---2.4.50).
	Error: The httpd container exits with a non-zero exit code (1) due to a misconfiguration in the httpd.conf file, specifically with the CGI directory permissions and the module loading sequence.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the CGI module is loaded correctly and the permissions for the CGI directory are set appropriately. Additionally, verify that the necessary modules for basic operation are loaded and the directory permissions are correctly configured.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container has a status of 'exited', indicating it is not running. The 'debian' container is running correctly. The services provided by the web search, 'httpd' and 'debian', are present. The 'httpd' service uses version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50, so it meets the version requirement.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits because of an incorrect configuration in the Dockerfile. The 'RUN chmod +x /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/cgi-bin/test.cgi' command attempts to change permissions on a file that might not exist at build time. This happens because the Dockerfile does not ensure the 'cgi-bin' directory exists before attempting to copy files into it.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the 'cgi-bin' directory exists before copying files into it and setting permissions. Modify the Dockerfile to create the necessary directory structure before copying files and setting permissions.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container has a 'Status' of 'exited' and 'Running' is 'False', indicating it is not running. The 'debian' container is running as expected. The services 'httpd' and 'debian' are present, and the 'httpd' version used is 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file, specifically the directory permissions and CGI script execution settings.
	Fix: Correct the directory permissions in 'httpd.conf' and ensure proper configuration for the CGI execution. Additionally, verify the Dockerfile to ensure all necessary directories and permissions are correctly set.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because the 'httpd' container is not running. Its state indicates 'Status': 'exited', 'Running': False, with an 'ExitCode': 1, which suggests that the container failed to start properly. However, the 'debian' service is running correctly, and the 'httpd' service uses version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The 'httpd' container failed to start due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file. Specifically, the 'ServerRoot' directive was set incorrectly, causing Apache to fail to locate its configuration and runtime files. Additionally, there was a potential issue with the Dockerfile not properly setting up the environment for Apache to run correctly.
	Fix: To fix the issue, I updated the 'httpd.conf' file to correctly specify the 'ServerRoot' directive. Additionally, I ensured that the Dockerfile was correctly configured to set up the Apache environment by adding necessary modules and configurations. This involved ensuring the 'ServerRoot' was correctly pointing to the default Apache directory and that all necessary modules were loaded properly.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container is in an exited state with ExitCode 1, indicating a failure to start.
2. The Docker system uses the expected services ['httpd', 'debian'] as per the logs.
3. The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is exiting with ExitCode 1, indicating a failure to start. This can be due to a configuration error, missing dependencies, or incorrect permissions.
	Fix: The error was fixed by ensuring that the configuration files are correctly set up and that the CGI script has the appropriate permissions. Additionally, the Dockerfile was updated to ensure that all necessary modules are loaded and that the CGI script is executable. The 'docker-compose.yml' was also checked to ensure that the 'httpd' service is correctly defined and can run independently.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because one of the containers (httpd) is not running. It has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start properly. This affects the overall goal of having the Docker containers running correctly. However, the services used are correct, and the version of 'httpd' used (2.4.50) is within the specified range.
	Error: The httpd container fails to start due to missing dependencies or incorrect configuration settings in the httpd.conf file. Specifically, the issue may arise from misconfigured directory permissions or missing essential modules.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that all necessary Apache modules are loaded, and the directory permissions are correctly set in the httpd.conf file. Additionally, verify that the Dockerfile correctly sets up the environment and that the CGI script has executable permissions.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running: The 'httpd' container is not running correctly as it has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup. The 'debian' container is running correctly.

2. Services Used: The logs indicate that both 'httpd' and 'debian' services are present.

3. Version of 'httpd': The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the Apache HTTP Server setup. Specifically, the configuration might be missing critical settings or modules that are required for the server to start successfully. Additionally, there might be issues with the image tag or the way the Dockerfile is structured, leading to an improper build or execution environment.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the Apache HTTP Server is correctly configured and all necessary modules are loaded. We'll modify the Dockerfile to ensure that the server starts with the correct configuration. We'll also verify the Docker Compose setup to ensure that the image is built and tagged correctly. This involves ensuring that the Apache server configuration allows for proper execution of CGI scripts and all necessary directories are correctly set up. We'll also check for any missing dependencies or misconfigurations in the httpd.conf file that might prevent the server from starting.
