Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section of the logs, which shows the 'Status' as 'exited' and 'Running' as 'False'. The container started and then exited almost immediately, with an 'ExitCode' of 1, suggesting an error occurred during startup. The service used is 'httpd' and the version is '2.4.49', which is within the specified range of vulnerable versions (2.4.49---2.4.50).
	Error: The container is using Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49, which is known to be vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013. This version contains a path traversal vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution (RCE) if CGI scripts are enabled. The error likely occurs because the container attempts to start with this vulnerable configuration and exits immediately due to potential security checks or misconfigurations in the httpd.conf file or the environment.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to update the Apache HTTP Server to a non-vulnerable version. However, since the version constraint is given, we will instead ensure that the configuration files are correctly set up to avoid immediate startup issues. We will also make sure that the directory permissions and script configurations are correct. The configuration should be properly set to handle CGI scripts and ensure all paths and modules are correctly specified. We will also ensure that the configuration files and scripts are correctly formatted and that the necessary modules are loaded.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the Docker image 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013' cannot be found on Docker Hub. This is likely because such a specific tag does not exist. The error also notes that the 'version' attribute in the 'docker-compose.yml' file is obsolete and should be removed.
	Fix: To fix the error, the 'docker-compose.yml' file needs to be updated to use an existing image tag for Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49, which is vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013. Since the specific tag '2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013' does not exist, we will use 'httpd:2.4.49'. Additionally, the obsolete 'version' attribute will be removed from the 'docker-compose.yml' file to avoid any warnings.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly because its 'State' indicates that the 'Status' is 'exited', 'Running' is 'False', and 'ExitCode' is '1', which suggests an error during execution.

2. The Docker uses the 'httpd' service as indicated by the 'Path' being 'httpd-foreground' and the 'Image' being 'httpd:2.4.49'.

3. The 'httpd' service version is 2.4.49, which falls within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The Docker container exits with code 1 because the Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 is vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013, which includes a path traversal vulnerability when CGI is enabled. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the server configuration and potentially execute arbitrary code.
	Fix: To fix the issue while adhering to the constraints, we can modify the 'httpd.conf' to disable CGI execution by removing or commenting out the 'LoadModule cgi_module modules/mod_cgi.so' line. This will prevent the exploitation of the CGI-related vulnerability. Additionally, we can ensure that the configuration is robust and does not allow unintended access or execution. However, since we need to demonstrate the vulnerability, the CGI should remain enabled for testing purposes, but this change will stop the immediate execution error.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the Docker image tag 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013' not being found in the Docker registry. This tag does not exist, which leads to the failure in resolving the reference during the Docker pull process.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to use a valid existing Docker image tag that matches the version constraints and includes the CVE identifier in the tag. Since 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013' does not exist, we will use 'httpd:2.4.49' and manually configure the environment to simulate CVE-2021-42013. This involves keeping CGI enabled and ensuring the configuration reflects a vulnerable setup as intended for testing purposes.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section of the logs, which shows 'Running: False' and 'ExitCode: 1'. This suggests that the container has exited with an error. The service used is 'httpd', and the version specified is 2.4.49, which falls within the given range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The Docker container is not running correctly due to a configuration issue related to the Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49, which is vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013. The configuration might not be correctly set to handle CGI scripts, or there might be an issue with directory permissions or module loading.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the configuration files are correctly set up to avoid immediate startup issues. Specifically, ensure that all necessary modules are loaded, directories have the correct permissions, and that CGI is enabled as intended for testing the vulnerability. Additionally, ensure that the Docker image tag includes the CVE identifier, as required by the constraints.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running: The container with ID 'a3856ecc920e3d4e22f59d339c6a6dbb715906150c9aff02acdf22fa51511d1d' is not running. The status shows 'exited', and 'Running' is 'False'.

2. Services Used: The container uses the service 'httpd', as indicated by the 'Cmd' field set to 'httpd-foreground' and the 'Image' field set to 'httpd:2.4.49'.

3. HTTPD Version: The 'HTTPD_VERSION' environment variable is set to '2.4.49', which is within the specified range of '2.4.49---2.4.50'.
	Error: The error is caused by the use of a vulnerable version of Apache HTTP Server (httpd:2.4.49), which is susceptible to CVE-2021-42013. The container exits because it may be misconfigured or due to the inherent vulnerability being exploited or causing a failure.
	Fix: To fix the issue while adhering to the constraints, we need to ensure that the Docker setup is correctly configured to demonstrate the vulnerability without causing the container to exit immediately. This involves ensuring that the configuration files are correctly set up, the necessary modules are loaded, and the directories have the correct permissions. We will also ensure that the image tag reflects the CVE identifier as required.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Docker image tag 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013' does not exist in the Docker Hub registry, which results in a failure to pull the image.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we will manually build a Docker image for 'httpd:2.4.49' and tag it with 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013'. This involves creating a Dockerfile that uses 'httpd:2.4.49' as the base image. The Dockerfile will ensure that the CGI module is enabled, and the configuration reflects a vulnerable setup intended for testing purposes. This approach ensures that the image can be pulled and used with the specified tag in the 'docker-compose.yml'.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section where 'Running' is False and 'ExitCode' is 1, which typically indicates an error during startup or execution.

2. The service 'httpd' is present and the version used is 2.4.49, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50. Hence, the service and version requirements are met.
	Error: The Docker container is not starting due to a misconfiguration in the 'docker-compose.yml' and 'Dockerfile'. The specified image tag 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013' does not exist, causing the container to fail to start. Additionally, the Dockerfile attempts to enable the CGI module in a way that may conflict with other configurations, leading to potential startup issues.
	Fix: To resolve the container startup issue, we will adjust the configuration to ensure compatibility and proper execution. We will:
1. Use an existing base image tag 'httpd:2.4.49' and manually configure it to simulate the CVE-2021-42013 vulnerability.
2. Ensure the CGI module is enabled correctly without conflicting with other settings.
3. Properly handle the configuration files to ensure no immediate execution errors.

The 'docker-compose.yml' will be updated to build the image locally and tag it with 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-42013'. The Dockerfile will ensure the CGI module is enabled and the configuration reflects a vulnerable setup.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly. The logs indicate that the container status is 'exited' and 'Running' is set to 'False'. The 'ExitCode' is 1, which suggests an error occurred during startup. However, the container is using the 'httpd' service with version '2.4.49', which matches the specified version range.
	Error: The container exits with code 1 due to incorrect permissions or misconfiguration in the Docker setup, particularly regarding the CGI execution environment or module loading.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the CGI module is enabled correctly and that the script permissions are set properly. Additionally, verify that the configuration files are correctly formatted and that all necessary modules are loaded. Ensure that the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are set up to use the correct image tag and configuration for Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section of the logs, which shows 'Status': 'exited' and 'Running': false. The 'ExitCode' is 1, which generally indicates an error occurred during startup. The container is using the 'httpd' service and the version 2.4.49, which falls within the specified range (2.4.49---2.4.50).
	Error: The Docker container exits with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the Apache HTTP Server settings or file permissions that prevent the server from starting correctly. This could be related to incorrect paths, missing files, or improper permissions for the CGI scripts.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that all paths in the Docker setup are correctly specified, permissions are set properly, and the necessary modules are loaded and configured correctly. We will update the Dockerfile to ensure that all configurations are correctly applied and that the server can start without errors. Additionally, we will ensure that the CGI scripts have the correct permissions and that the Apache configuration does not contain any errors that would prevent startup.
