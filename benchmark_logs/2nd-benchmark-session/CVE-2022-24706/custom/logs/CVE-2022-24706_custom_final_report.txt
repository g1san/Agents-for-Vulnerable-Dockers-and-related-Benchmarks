Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs**: The container has 'Status': 'exited', 'Running': False, and 'ExitCode': 1, indicating it is not running correctly. The exit code suggests an error during startup.

2. **Services Ok**: The logs only mention 'couchdb' and do not provide any evidence of 'erlang' being used as a separate service or dependency.

3. **Code Main Version**: The 'COUCHDB_VERSION' environment variable is set to '3.2.1-1', which matches the specified acceptable version '3.2.1'.
	Error: The error likely stems from the absence of a necessary Erlang runtime environment, which is crucial for CouchDB to operate, as well as potential misconfigurations in the CouchDB setup, such as incorrect binding or authentication settings.
	Fix: To resolve this, ensure that the CouchDB service is correctly configured and that its dependencies, particularly Erlang, are properly included. Update the Dockerfile to explicitly include the necessary Erlang version, and adjust the CouchDB configuration to ensure correct binding and authentication settings.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version '1:23.3.4.5' of the 'erlang-base' package is not available in the Debian Bullseye repositories. The package manager cannot find and install this specific version, causing the build process to fail.
	Fix: To fix this, we need to ensure that the correct version of Erlang is installed. Since the specified version '1:23.3.4.5' is not available, we can install the latest available version of 'erlang-base' from the repositories, which should be compatible with CouchDB 3.2.1. Additionally, we will remove the `version` attribute from the `docker-compose.yml` file as it is obsolete.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container for the 'couchdb' service is not running correctly. The logs indicate that the container has an 'exited' status with an exit code of 1, which typically signifies an error occurred during startup. This prevents the Docker system from running correctly. However, the services 'couchdb' and 'erlang' are present in the configuration, and the 'couchdb' version used is 3.2.1, which matches the specified version.
	Error: The CouchDB container exits with code 1, indicating a startup error. The logs may not provide a clear reason, but it could be due to misconfiguration or missing dependencies.
	Fix: To fix the problem, I ensured the correct version of Erlang is installed by explicitly specifying it in the Dockerfile. Additionally, I checked the CouchDB configuration to ensure it is correct and complete. I also ensured the image tag includes CVE-2022-24706, as required. The Dockerfile was modified to install the specific version of Erlang required by CouchDB, and the Docker Compose file was updated to ensure proper configuration and binding.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the specified version '1:23.3.4.5' of 'erlang-base' not being found in the package repositories. This is causing the Docker build process to fail when attempting to install this specific version.
	Fix: Instead of specifying a fixed version for 'erlang-base', we can install the latest available version from the Debian repositories. This approach ensures compatibility and resolves the version not found error. Additionally, since the CouchDB version is fixed and the Erlang version is not crucially tied to a specific minor version, using the latest available version should suffice.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container for CouchDB is not running correctly. The logs indicate that the container exited with an ExitCode of 1, which typically signifies an error during startup. This suggests that the Docker is not running as expected. However, the services used include CouchDB and the version 3.2.1 is specified, which matches the required version. The logs do not mention Erlang explicitly, but CouchDB's operation inherently requires Erlang, implying its presence.
	Error: The CouchDB container exits with an ExitCode of 1 due to a misconfiguration in the Docker setup. Specifically, the Dockerfile installs 'erlang-base', but it does not ensure that all necessary Erlang components required by CouchDB are installed. Additionally, the Docker Compose file specifies an image tag with CVE-2022-24706, which is correct, but the build context may not be properly configured to utilize this image effectively.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that all necessary Erlang components are installed. Instead of installing just 'erlang-base', we will install the 'erlang' package, which includes all necessary components required by CouchDB. Additionally, we will ensure that the Docker Compose setup correctly uses the specified CouchDB image with the CVE-2022-24706 tag. This involves removing the 'build' directive in the Docker Compose file to avoid conflicts between building from a Dockerfile and pulling a pre-built image.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly: The container with ID '04e43b0cf99a' has a status of 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating that it failed to start or run properly.

2. Services are correctly used: The logs indicate the presence of the 'couchdb' service, as expected.

3. The version of 'couchdb' used is 3.2.1, which matches the specified version in the requirements.
	Error: The Docker container for CouchDB is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates a startup failure due to misconfiguration or missing dependencies. The logs do not provide specific details, but common issues include incorrect environment settings or missing dependencies such as Erlang.
	Fix: To address the issue, ensure that all environment variables are correctly set and that the required dependencies, particularly Erlang, are available. Since we cannot modify Erlang installation directly due to previous attempts, we can adjust the configuration to ensure proper service startup. Verify the CouchDB configuration and ensure that the required ports and volumes are correctly mapped.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State': {'Status': 'exited', 'Running': False}. This suggests that the container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error occurred during execution.

2. The services 'couchdb' and 'erlang' are present as indicated by the 'com.docker.compose.service': 'couchdb'. Although 'erlang' is not explicitly mentioned, it is typically a dependency for CouchDB and is likely included in the CouchDB image.

3. The Docker uses the specified version of 'couchdb' (3.2.1) as indicated by 'COUCHDB_VERSION=3.2.1-1' and 'Image': 'couchdb:3.2.1-CVE-2022-24706', which aligns with the required version.
	Error: The Docker container is not running correctly, and the error is likely due to misconfiguration of the CouchDB service or its dependencies. The container exits with an error code of 1, indicating a problem during execution. The common issues could be related to incorrect environment variables, misconfigured ports, or missing dependencies.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the CouchDB environment variables are correctly set, and verify that the ports and volumes are properly configured. Additionally, ensure that the CouchDB image used is compatible with the required Erlang version, and that the configuration files are correctly set up to allow proper binding and authentication. The CouchDB configuration should be checked to ensure it matches the expected settings for the specified version, and any missing dependencies should be addressed.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section where 'Status' is 'exited' and 'Running' is 'False'. This suggests the container has stopped, possibly due to an error or misconfiguration.

2. The logs provided only include information about a CouchDB container. There is no mention of an Erlang service being used, which means that the required services list ['couchdb', 'erlang'] is not fully met.

3. The Docker uses CouchDB version '3.2.1-1', which is within the specified version list (3.2.1). Therefore, this goal is achieved.
	Error: The Docker container is not running correctly due to the absence of the Erlang service, which is required for CouchDB to function. This is evident as the container exits immediately upon startup.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the Erlang service is included in the Docker Compose setup. We will add an Erlang service to the `docker-compose.yml` file, using the specified version '23.3.4.5' for Erlang. This will ensure that CouchDB has its necessary runtime environment, allowing the container to run correctly.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container for 'couchdb' is not running correctly as indicated by its 'State' status being 'exited' with an 'ExitCode' of 1. This suggests a failure during startup, possibly due to a misconfiguration or missing dependencies. The 'erlang' container is running correctly. The services 'couchdb' and 'erlang' are present, and the 'couchdb' service is using version '3.2.1-1', which matches the required version range.
	Error: The 'couchdb' service exits with code 1 due to a configuration error. The issue could be related to the environment variables or the configuration settings in 'local.ini'. Specifically, the 'NODENAME' environment variable might be incorrectly set, causing CouchDB to fail to initialize properly.
	Fix: To address the issue, we need to ensure that the 'NODENAME' environment variable is set correctly. CouchDB requires a valid hostname to start properly. We will update the 'NODENAME' to a more appropriate value. Additionally, verify the configuration in 'local.ini' to ensure that it aligns with CouchDB's expected settings.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the CouchDB container has an 'exited' status with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure during startup. The logs confirm that both 'couchdb' and 'erlang' services are included, and the CouchDB version used is 3.2.1, which matches the required version.
	Error: The CouchDB container fails to start due to an incorrect Erlang node name configuration. The 'NODENAME' environment variable is set to 'couchdb@127.0.0.1', which is not accessible within the container network. This causes CouchDB to fail during the Erlang node initialization step, resulting in an exit code of 1.
	Fix: To fix the issue, update the 'NODENAME' environment variable to use a name that is resolvable within the Docker network. The convention is to use the service name defined in the Docker Compose file. Therefore, set 'NODENAME' to 'couchdb@couchdb' to ensure that CouchDB can properly initialize its Erlang node. Additionally, remove the 'depends_on' directive for 'couchdb' as it is not necessary for the Erlang service.
