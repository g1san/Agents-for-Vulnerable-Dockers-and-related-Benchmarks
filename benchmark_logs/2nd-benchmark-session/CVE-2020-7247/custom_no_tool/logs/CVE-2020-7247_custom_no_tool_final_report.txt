Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the attempt to install a specific version of the OpenSMTPD package (6.6.1-r0) that is no longer available in the Alpine Linux package repository. The package manager is unable to find and select this specific version, resulting in a failure to build the Docker image.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install the latest available version of OpenSMTPD that falls within the specified version range (6.6---6.6.1). We will remove the specific version constraint from the apk add command, allowing it to install the available version within the acceptable range. Additionally, we will update the directory structure and file paths to ensure they align with the required structure.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, so no information is available to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if the required services are being used, or if the correct version of 'opensmtpd' is implemented.
	Error: The Docker system is not functioning as expected due to several configuration issues in the Docker Compose setup and Dockerfile, primarily related to incorrect service configurations and version specifications, as well as potential issues with the network and startup script.
	Fix: To address the issue, the following changes are made: 1) Ensure the Docker Compose service uses the correct image tag for OpenSMTPD. 2) Modify the Dockerfile to explicitly install a specific version of OpenSMTPD within the specified range. 3) Correct the network configuration and ensure the startup script properly initializes the service without errors. 4) Ensure the directory structure and file paths are correct and align with the required structure.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' typically occurs due to incorrect YAML syntax, such as improper indentation or misplaced colons. In this case, the issue is likely due to the newline characters ('\n') within the YAML content, which disrupt the correct structure and indentation.
	Fix: To fix the error, I will correct the YAML syntax in the 'docker-compose.yml' file by ensuring proper indentation and removing any extraneous newline characters that disrupt the structure.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.1-r0) is not available in the Alpine 3.11 package repository. The package manager is trying to resolve dependencies but cannot find the exact version specified, leading to a conflict with the available version (6.6.4p1-r1).
	Fix: To fix this, we should ensure that the Dockerfile installs a version of OpenSMTPD within the specified range that is actually available. Since the precise version 6.6.1-r0 is not available, and we need to adhere to the specified range, we should check if the closest available version is within this range. If not, we might need to adjust our approach to installing the package, such as using a different Alpine version or mirroring the package from a custom repository if it fits the version constraints. Alternatively, we can build OpenSMTPD from source if necessary to match the required version.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Error: The Docker build process is failing because the specified versions of the OpenSMTPD package (6.6.1-r0 and 6.6.0-r0) are not available in the Alpine Linux repositories. The error indicates that the package manager cannot find these specific versions, leading to a failure in the installation process.
	Fix: To resolve this issue, we will modify the Dockerfile to install OpenSMTPD by building it from source to ensure the version falls within the specified range of 6.6 to 6.6.1. This approach bypasses the package manager's version constraints and allows us to control the version installed. Additionally, we will ensure that the directory structure and file paths align with the required structure.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the 'configure' script is not found in the OpenSMTPD source code directory after cloning the repository and checking out the specified tag (6.6.1). This typically happens when the source code repository does not include the 'configure' script directly, and it needs to be generated using 'autogen.sh' or 'autoreconf'.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the 'configure' script is generated before attempting to run it. This is typically done by running 'autoreconf -i' or './autogen.sh' in the source directory. We will modify the Dockerfile to include this step before running './configure'.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the `autoreconf -i` command requires either a `configure.ac` or `configure.in` file in the OpenSMTPD source directory, but it is missing in the cloned repository. This prevents the subsequent `./configure` command from executing, as the configuration script is not generated.
	Fix: To fix this error, we need to ensure that the `configure` script is available. Since the OpenSMTPD repository at the specified commit does not have the necessary `configure.ac` or `configure.in` file, we should switch to a different branch or tag that includes a pre-generated `configure` script. Alternatively, we can manually add a `configure.ac` file if we know the necessary configuration. However, since this is a specific version requirement, the best approach is to use a tagged release that has the configuration script included.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the './configure' script is not found when attempting to build OpenSMTPD from source. This suggests that the repository might not include a pre-generated 'configure' script, which is necessary for the build process to proceed.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the 'configure' script is generated before attempting to run it. This is typically done by running 'autoreconf -i' or './autogen.sh' in the source directory. We will modify the Dockerfile to include this step before running './configure'.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error occurred because the 'autoreconf -i' command failed due to the absence of 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' files in the specified commit of the OpenSMTPD repository. This indicates that the repository at the specified commit does not have the necessary files to generate the 'configure' script, leading to the failure of the build process.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the 'configure' script is available for execution. Since the specified commit does not contain the necessary 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' files, we should switch to a commit or tag that includes a pre-generated 'configure' script. Alternatively, we can download a release archive from the OpenSMTPD repository that contains the 'configure' script. This approach ensures that we have a complete set of build scripts and avoids the need for 'autoreconf'.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the absence of the `configure` script when attempting to build OpenSMTPD from the source. This typically occurs when the source archive does not include pre-generated build scripts, which are necessary to run the `./configure` command.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `configure` script is generated before attempting to run it. This can be done by running `autoreconf -i` in the source directory to generate the necessary `configure` script. Additionally, ensure all necessary build dependencies are available.
