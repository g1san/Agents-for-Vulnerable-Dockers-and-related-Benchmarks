Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the Dockerfile trying to run './mvnw clean package -DskipTests', but the 'mvnw' (Maven Wrapper) file is not found in the expected location. This results in a '/bin/sh: 1: ./mvnw: not found' error, which indicates that the 'mvnw' script is missing or not executable.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the Maven Wrapper is included in the 'app' directory being copied to the Docker image. This typically involves adding the 'mvnw' and 'mvnw.cmd' files as well as the '.mvn' directory to the 'app' directory before copying it into the Docker image. Additionally, we can install Maven directly in the Docker image to avoid relying on the Maven Wrapper.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the Maven build process is failing due to missing version information for dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. Specifically, the `spring-boot-starter` dependency is missing a version, and the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` in the build section also lacks a version specification. These missing versions prevent Maven from resolving the dependencies correctly, resulting in a build failure.
	Fix: To fix the issue, the `pom.xml` file needs to be updated to include the version for the `spring-boot-starter` dependency and the `spring-boot-maven-plugin`. By specifying these versions, Maven will be able to resolve and download the necessary dependencies, allowing the build process to complete successfully.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Error: The Docker build process fails due to a compilation error. The error message indicates that the Java source and target options specified in the Maven build are outdated and not supported by the Maven Compiler Plugin version being used. Specifically, the source and target options are set to 1.5, which are no longer supported. The build process requires these to be updated to at least 1.6 or later.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, the `pom.xml` file needs to be updated to specify the correct source and target versions for the Java compiler. Since the application is using Java 11, the source and target options should be set to 11. This ensures compatibility with the Java version being used and resolves the compilation error.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly as the status is 'exited' and 'Running' is false with an 'ExitCode' of 1, indicating an error during execution.
2. The services used include 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' and 'openjdk', which matches the required services.
3. The version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' is 'CVE-2022-22963', which does not match the specified allowed versions 3.1.6 or 3.2.2.
	Error: The Docker container is exiting with an 'ExitCode' of 1 due to the use of a vulnerable version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' (CVE-2022-22963) that is not allowed according to the specified versions (3.1.6 or 3.2.2).
	Fix: To resolve the issue, update the Docker configuration to use a non-vulnerable version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function'. Since the CVE-2022-22963 must be specified in the image tag, we need to ensure the application uses the allowed versions (3.1.6 or 3.2.2) in the application dependencies while maintaining the CVE tag in the Docker image.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' showing 'Status': 'exited' and 'ExitCode': 1, which means the container has stopped and exited with an error.

2. The services used in the Docker ('springcloud/spring-cloud-function' and 'openjdk') are correct as per the log details.

3. The version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' being used is 'CVE-2022-22963', which does not match the required versions of 3.1.6 or 3.2.2. Hence, it fails the version requirement.
	Error: The Docker container is exiting with code 1 because the 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' version specified in the docker-compose file is not compatible with the application dependencies. The Docker image tag 'CVE-2022-22963' is used, but the application dependencies require version 3.1.6 or 3.2.2, causing a mismatch and failure to start.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we will ensure that the Docker image tag remains 'CVE-2022-22963' as required, but we will adjust the application dependencies to match the specified versions. We will update the 'pom.xml' to use the correct version of 'spring-cloud-starter-function-web' that aligns with the Docker image constraints. This involves ensuring that our application is compatible with the image version constraints while maintaining the CVE tag.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly: The container has exited with ExitCode 1, indicating an error occurred during execution.

2. The 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' version used in the Docker image is tagged as 'CVE-2022-22963', which is not one of the specified versions (3.1.6, 3.2.2) required for compliance.
	Error: The container is not running correctly due to an incorrect version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' being used in the Docker image, which is tagged as 'CVE-2022-22963'. This tag is not among the specified versions (3.1.6, 3.2.2) required for compliance, leading to an exit code of 1.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the application dependencies match the specified versions while maintaining the CVE tag in the Docker image. We will update the 'pom.xml' to use the correct version of 'spring-cloud-starter-function-web' that aligns with the Docker image constraints. This involves ensuring that our application is compatible with the image version constraints while maintaining the CVE tag. We will also ensure the Docker image is built correctly by adding necessary files and dependencies.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly. According to the logs, the container's 'State' indicates 'Status': 'exited' and 'Running': False with an 'ExitCode': 1, which suggests that the container has stopped due to an error during execution. However, the services 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' and 'openjdk' are present, and the version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' matches the specified versions (3.1.6, 3.2.2), thus fulfilling the other two goals.
	Error: The Docker container exits with code 1, which typically indicates an error during the execution of the application. The logs suggest that the application might not be starting correctly due to a missing or improperly specified entry point or jar file.
	Fix: To address the issue, ensure that the jar file specified in the ENTRYPOINT command in the Dockerfile is correctly named and exists at the specified location. Additionally, confirm that the Maven build process successfully creates the jar file in the expected directory. We also need to ensure that the application is configured correctly and that all necessary dependencies are included in the build.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'Running: False' status and 'ExitCode: 1'. The container exited almost immediately after starting, which suggests an error in the startup process. The services used in the Docker image include 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' and 'openjdk', which are correct. The version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' used in the image is 'CVE-2022-22963', which is not one of the specified versions (3.1.6 or 3.2.2).
	Error: The error causing the Docker container to terminate is due to the use of a vulnerable version of 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' (CVE-2022-22963) in the Docker image, which is not compatible with the specified application dependencies version (3.1.6). Furthermore, the application might not be correctly packaged or the jar file might not exist at the specified location.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure the application dependencies in 'pom.xml' are compatible with the vulnerable Docker image version (CVE-2022-22963) while maintaining the image tag. This involves updating the 'spring-cloud-starter-function-web' dependency to use version 3.1.6. Additionally, we must ensure that the jar file is correctly built and exists at the specified location in the Dockerfile. Furthermore, we need to ensure the application is configured correctly and all necessary dependencies are included in the build.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running because its 'State' indicates 'Status': 'exited' and 'Running': False with an 'ExitCode' of 1, which typically denotes an error during execution.

2. The Docker image used is 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function:CVE-2022-22963', which is a known vulnerable version and not part of the specified safe versions (3.1.6, 3.2.2). 

3. The services 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' and 'openjdk' are present in the Docker configuration, meeting the requirement for services.
	Error: The Docker container is not running due to an error in the application code or configuration, resulting in an exit with code 1. The error may stem from dependency mismatches or incorrect configurations in the Docker setup, particularly with the vulnerable version of the 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function' image.
	Fix: To fix the issue, update the Docker configuration and application dependencies to ensure compatibility with the specified versions. This involves updating the 'pom.xml' to use the correct version of dependencies, ensuring the application is correctly configured, and verifying that the jar file is built and exists at the specified location in the Dockerfile. Additionally, ensure that the Docker image is built correctly by adding necessary files and dependencies. Specifically, update the 'spring-cloud-starter-function-web' dependency to version 3.1.6 and ensure the application runs with the correct configurations.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs**: The container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' showing 'Running: False' and an 'ExitCode' of 1, which suggests an error occurred during execution.

2. **Services Ok**: The Docker image used is 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function:CVE-2022-22963', which includes the required service 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function'. Additionally, the environment variables indicate the presence of 'openjdk'.

3. **Code Main Version**: The version 'CVE-2022-22963' does not match the specified versions 3.1.6 or 3.2.2. Hence, it does not meet the requirement for the 'MAIN' service version.
	Error: The application is not running due to a mismatch in the Spring Cloud Function version specified in the Docker image and the version required in the application dependencies. The image 'springcloud/spring-cloud-function:CVE-2022-22963' does not match the required versions 3.1.6 or 3.2.2 specified in the application dependencies, leading to incompatibility issues.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the Spring Cloud Function version used in the application dependencies matches the Docker image's version constraints while maintaining the CVE tag. We will update the 'pom.xml' to use the correct version of 'spring-cloud-starter-function-web' that aligns with the Docker image constraints.
