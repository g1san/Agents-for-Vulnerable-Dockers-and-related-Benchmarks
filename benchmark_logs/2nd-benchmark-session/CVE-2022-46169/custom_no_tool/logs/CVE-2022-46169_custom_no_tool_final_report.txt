Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the 'environment' section for the 'mysql' service in the 'docker-compose.yml' file is not formatted correctly. Specifically, it should be a mapping (a dictionary in YAML), but it is currently written as a list.
	Fix: Convert the 'environment' section of the 'mysql' service in 'docker-compose.yml' from a list to a mapping. This involves changing the format from a list of strings to key-value pairs.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs is related to downloading and extracting the Cacti tarball. The error message 'gzip: stdin: not in gzip format' indicates that the downloaded file is not a valid gzip file, which suggests that the download might have failed or the URL is incorrect.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the URL used to download the Cacti tarball is correct and that the file is in gzip format. Additionally, we can add a check to verify the file type before attempting to extract it.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the command in the Dockerfile failing to successfully download and extract the Cacti tarball. The error message indicates that the file may not be in the expected format or the download URL is incorrect.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the URL for downloading the Cacti tarball is correct and that the file is properly downloaded and verified before extraction. Additionally, the verification of the file type using the 'file' command can be improved by checking for a successful exit status before proceeding with extraction.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the downloaded file 'cacti-1.2.22.tar.gz' is not in the expected gzip format. This suggests that the URL used for downloading might not be returning the expected file, possibly due to a redirect or a change in the URL structure.
	Fix: To resolve this issue, update the URL to ensure it points directly to the gzip file, or handle the file download correctly by checking the actual file type or content. Additionally, verify the URL manually to ensure it's correct and accessible.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the downloaded file not being in the expected gzip format. The curl command is downloading a file that does not match the expected format, leading to the failure in the extraction step.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the URL used to download the Cacti tarball is correct and that the file is in the expected gzip format. Additionally, verify the actual content of the downloaded file to ensure it is correct before extraction. If the file is not in gzip format, attempt to fix the URL or handle the file download differently.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the downloaded file not being in gzip format. The 'curl' command downloads a file from the specified URL, but the file is not a valid gzip file as expected, leading to the extraction failure.
	Fix: To fix the issue, modify the Dockerfile to ensure the downloaded file is correctly handled. We will check the content type of the file using 'curl' before downloading it and ensure it is in the expected format. If not, we will handle it accordingly.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the curl command is unable to download the Cacti tarball from the specified URL. The connection is likely failing or the URL is incorrect, leading to a zero-byte file being downloaded, which cannot be extracted.
	Fix: To fix the error, we can modify the Dockerfile to ensure that the Cacti tarball is downloaded successfully. Instead of checking the content type, we can directly attempt the download and check if the file exists and has a non-zero size before proceeding with the extraction. This approach will ensure that we only attempt to extract the file if it has been downloaded correctly.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the downloaded file 'cacti-1.2.22.tar.gz' is not in gzip format, leading to the failure of the 'tar -zxvf' command. This indicates that the file might be empty or not properly downloaded as a gzip archive.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the file is correctly downloaded and is in the gzip format. We can use 'curl' to check the HTTP status code after downloading the file. If the status code is not 200, the download failed. Additionally, we should verify the file type before extraction using the 'file' command.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error occurs during the download and extraction of the Cacti tarball. The HTTP status code returned by the curl command is 403, indicating a forbidden access, which means the file could not be downloaded due to permission issues or incorrect URL.
	Fix: The fix involves changing the method of downloading the Cacti tarball by using a different source that does not result in a 403 error. We will use GitHub as the source for downloading the Cacti tarball, ensuring the URL is correct and accessible.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the tarball file 'cacti-1.2.22.tar.gz' was not downloaded completely or was corrupted, leading to an unexpected end of file during the extraction process. This is often due to network issues or an incorrect URL.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we will implement a retry mechanism for the download process to ensure the file is downloaded completely. We will use a loop to attempt the download multiple times if it fails, and check the integrity of the downloaded file before proceeding with the extraction.
