    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, specifically related to its command line interface (CLI). The vulnerability arises from the use of the args4j library, which allows an @ character followed by a file path in an argument to be replaced with the file's contents. This feature, enabled by default in Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. Attackers without this permission can still read the first few lines of files. The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution (RCE) if attackers exploit the ability to read cryptographic keys from binary files. Jenkins 2.442 and LTS 2.426.3 disable this feature to mitigate the issue.",
