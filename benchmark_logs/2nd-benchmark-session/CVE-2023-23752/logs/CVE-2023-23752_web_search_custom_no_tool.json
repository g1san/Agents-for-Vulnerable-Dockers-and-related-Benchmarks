    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is a security vulnerability in Joomla! versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7, described as an \"improper access check\" leading to an authentication bypass. This vulnerability allows attackers to leak privileged information, such as MySQL database credentials, by exploiting the bypass to access system configuration data. Although the exposure of database credentials is considered a misconfiguration risk, attackers can leverage this information to gain access to the Joomla! administrative interface and potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is rated as medium severity (CVSSv3 5.3) but can lead to code execution under certain conditions.",
