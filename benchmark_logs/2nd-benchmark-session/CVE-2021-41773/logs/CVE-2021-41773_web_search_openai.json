    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a path traversal vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. This flaw allows attackers to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" the requests can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. This issue is known to have been exploited in the wild. The vulnerability affects only Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.",
