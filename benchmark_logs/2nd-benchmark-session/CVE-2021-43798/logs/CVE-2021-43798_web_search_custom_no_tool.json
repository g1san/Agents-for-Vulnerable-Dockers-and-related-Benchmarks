{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a path traversal vulnerability in Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to local files through directory traversal, specifically via the URL path `<grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/:pluginId`, where `:pluginId` is the plugin ID for any installed plugin. The vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or the SQLite database at `/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db`, without authentication. The issue was introduced due to improper path sanitization in the `getPluginAssets` method and was fixed in versions 8.3.1, 8.2.7, 8.1.8, and 8.0.7.",
