Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: line 3: found character that cannot start any token' indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file, particularly around line 3. This is often due to incorrect indentation or the presence of illegal characters that YAML does not recognize as valid syntax.
	Fix: The issue was caused by incorrect indentation in the YAML file. YAML is sensitive to whitespace and requires consistent indentation. The corrected file ensures proper indentation for all elements, ensuring that the YAML parser can correctly interpret the file structure.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: found character that cannot start any token' typically indicates a syntax error in the YAML file, often due to special characters or incorrect formatting that the YAML parser cannot interpret.
	Fix: The provided 'docker-compose.yml' file seems to be correctly formatted in terms of indentation and structure. The error might have been caused by invisible characters or encoding issues. To resolve this, the YAML file has been rewritten to ensure it uses UTF-8 encoding and that no invisible or special characters are present.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the Docker images 'jetbrains/teamcity-server:2023.05.3-CVE-2023-42793' and 'jetbrains/teamcity-agent:2023.05.3-CVE-2023-42793' not being found on the Docker registry. This indicates that these specific image tags do not exist.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to use the correct image tags that are available on the Docker registry. Since the CVE-2023-42793 tag is required, it is crucial to ensure that the tags exist. The suggested fix is to use the existing version '2023.05.3' without the CVE suffix, as the CVE-specific tag does not exist. This aligns with the available versions and allows the system to be deployable.========== Test Passed! Generated Code (Final Version) ==========
