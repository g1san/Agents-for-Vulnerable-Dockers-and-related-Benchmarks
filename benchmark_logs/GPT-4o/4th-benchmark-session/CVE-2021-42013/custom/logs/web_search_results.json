    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical security vulnerability found in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability arises from an incomplete fix for a previous issue (CVE-2021-41773) and allows attackers to perform a path traversal attack. This attack can lead to remote code execution if the server is configured with Alias-like directives and CGI scripts are enabled. The flaw occurs when the 'require all denied' access control is not effectively enforced due to inadequate input validation. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting requests to access files outside the intended document root, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.",
