----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2021-42013 is a critical security vulnerability found in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability arises from an incomplete fix for a previous issue (CVE-2021-41773) and allows attackers to perform a path traversal attack. This attack can lead to remote code execution if the server is configured with Alias-like directives and CGI scripts are enabled. The flaw occurs when the 'require all denied' access control is not effectively enforced due to inadequate input validation. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting requests to access files outside the intended document root, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.
Attack Type: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49', '2.4.50']] Apache HTTP Server is the main service affected by CVE-2021-42013, as it contains the vulnerability that allows path traversal and remote code execution.
- [SOFT][debian][['bullseye']] Debian is used as the base operating system for the Docker container to ensure compatibility and stability of the Apache HTTP Server.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified version '2.4.49-1' of the Apache package is not found in the Debian Bullseye repository. This version is likely not available in the current package repositories.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 using an alternative method, such as downloading and installing it from a specific source or repository where this version is available. In this solution, we will use a direct download link for the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 source code and compile it during the Docker build process.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error message indicates that the 'docker-compose.yml' file is not properly formatted. Specifically, it seems like there is a syntax error due to the presence of newline characters (\n) within the YAML structure, which is causing the validation to fail.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, the 'docker-compose.yml' file needs to be corrected by removing the newline characters and ensuring proper YAML syntax. Additionally, ensure that the 'build' context is correctly specified in the 'docker-compose.yml' file.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the Docker build process fails because the specified version of Apache HTTP Server (2.4.49) is not available at the provided URL. This results in a 404 Not Found error when attempting to download the tarball.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we will modify the Dockerfile to use a known available version of Apache HTTP Server that can be downloaded and built. Since the CVE-2021-42013 affects versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, we will switch to version 2.4.50, which is still within the affected range and should be available for download. This change ensures that the Docker build process completes successfully without altering the demonstration of the vulnerability.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is a 404 Not Found when attempting to download Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.50 from the specified URL. This indicates that the file is no longer available at that location.
	- FIX: To fix the error, we will switch to using a different method to install Apache 2.4.50. Instead of downloading the source and compiling it, we will use the package manager to install the specific version of Apache HTTP Server from the Debian repositories. This ensures that the build process can complete successfully without relying on an unavailable URL.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the specific version '2.4.50-1' of Apache HTTP Server is not available in the Debian Bullseye repositories. This is causing the Docker build process to fail at the step where it attempts to install Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.50-1.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we will modify the Dockerfile to install Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.50 directly from the source. This involves downloading the source code for Apache 2.4.50, configuring, and compiling it during the Docker build process. This approach ensures that we use the exact version of Apache HTTP Server needed to demonstrate the CVE-2021-42013 vulnerability.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified version of the Apache HTTP Server (2.4.50) is no longer available at the provided URL, resulting in a 404 Not Found error during the Docker build process.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, I will modify the Dockerfile to use a different source for downloading Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50. Instead of relying on the official Apache download site, I will use a mirror that still hosts the version. Additionally, I will ensure that the Docker setup is streamlined for easy deployment with 'docker compose up'.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library is not found during the build process. This is a prerequisite for building Apache HTTP Server from source, and its absence causes the build to fail.
	- FIX: To resolve the error, the Dockerfile needs to be modified to install the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and its development tools before compiling Apache HTTP Server. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are available. Additionally, we will install the APR-util, which is also required.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the build process fails because the 'pcre-config' for libpcre is not found. PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) is required by Apache HTTP Server for certain functionalities during the build process. Without this library, the configuration step of building Apache cannot complete successfully, resulting in the build termination.
	- FIX: To fix the error, the Dockerfile should be modified to include the installation of the 'libpcre3-dev' package, which provides the necessary PCRE development files for compiling Apache HTTP Server. This ensures that the 'pcre-config' script is available, allowing the configuration step to proceed without errors.

Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
