    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management and orchestration tool. The flaw exists due to improper authentication mechanisms in the ClearFuncs class of the Salt master server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt master server and all connected minions. The lack of proper validation of method calls enables attackers to exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests, potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2, and it is crucial for users to update to patched versions to secure their systems.",
