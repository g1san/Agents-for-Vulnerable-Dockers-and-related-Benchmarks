CVE description: CVE-2018-12613 is a critical vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, a widely-used web-based administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB. This vulnerability arises from improper input validation and flawed whitelist checks, which allows attackers to include and potentially execute files on the server. The vulnerability can be exploited through Local File Inclusion (LFI) techniques, where attackers can bypass authentication checks using double encoding and directory traversal attacks. This enables them to include local files, execute arbitrary PHP code, and potentially gain remote code execution (RCE) capabilities. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because phpMyAdmin is commonly used in hosting environments, making it a potential target for attackers seeking to compromise database servers. This issue was patched in version 4.8.2.
Attack Type: Local File Inclusion (LFI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] phpMyAdmin is the affected service with the vulnerability in versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, allowing Local File Inclusion and potential Remote Code Execution.
- [SOFT-WEB][php][['7.2-apache']] PHP is required to run phpMyAdmin, and version 7.2-apache is compatible with the vulnerable phpMyAdmin versions.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is the database server that phpMyAdmin manages, and version 5.7 is compatible with the vulnerable phpMyAdmin versions.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is caused by the 'apt-get update' command failing to fetch the package lists from the Debian 'buster' repositories due to a '404 Not Found' error. This indicates that the 'buster' release repositories are no longer available at the specified URLs, likely because 'buster' is an older Debian release that has reached its end of life.
	- FIX: To fix the error, the Dockerfile should be updated to use a newer base image that is still supported and has active repositories. Instead of using 'php:7.2-apache', which is based on Debian 'buster', switch to a newer version of PHP that is still supported. This will ensure that the package repositories are accessible and the 'apt-get update' command will succeed.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs due to the use of an unrecognized option '--with-jpeg-dir' in the 'docker-php-ext-configure gd' command. This option is deprecated in newer versions of PHP.
	- FIX: To resolve this error, the '--with-jpeg-dir' option should be removed from the 'docker-php-ext-configure gd' command, as it is no longer needed in newer PHP versions. The GD extension can now automatically detect the JPEG library.

Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
