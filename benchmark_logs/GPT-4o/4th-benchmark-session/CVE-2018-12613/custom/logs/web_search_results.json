    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability arises due to improper input validation in the application, specifically in the `index.php` file, which fails to properly sanitize user inputs. This leads to directory traversal and file inclusion attacks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request that bypasses input filters using double encoding techniques, such as the `%253f` character, allowing unauthorized access to local files on the server. If an attacker can include a file containing PHP code, it may lead to remote code execution (RCE). This is possible if the attacker can query a SELECT SQL statement with PHP code, which is then executed by including a session file located in `/var/lib/php/sessions/`. The vulnerability is further exacerbated by specific configurations in phpMyAdmin, such as setting `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']` to true or `$cfg['ServerDefault']` to 0, which can bypass authentication and allow the execution of arbitrary code. Exploitation typically requires authentication, but certain configurations may allow unauthenticated exploitation.",
