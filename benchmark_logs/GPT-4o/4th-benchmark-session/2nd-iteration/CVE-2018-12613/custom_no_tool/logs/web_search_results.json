    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a critical vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, a widely-used web-based administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB. This vulnerability arises from improper input validation and flawed whitelist checks, which allows attackers to include and potentially execute files on the server. The vulnerability can be exploited through Local File Inclusion (LFI) techniques, where attackers can bypass authentication checks using double encoding and directory traversal attacks. This enables them to include local files, execute arbitrary PHP code, and potentially gain remote code execution (RCE) capabilities. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because phpMyAdmin is commonly used in hosting environments, making it a potential target for attackers seeking to compromise database servers. This issue was patched in version 4.8.2.",
