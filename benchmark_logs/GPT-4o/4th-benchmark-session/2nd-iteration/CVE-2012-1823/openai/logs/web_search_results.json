    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical security vulnerability identified in PHP versions prior to 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, specifically when PHP is configured to run as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script, commonly referred to as `php-cgi`. This flaw arises from improper handling of query strings that lack an equals sign (`=`) character. An attacker can exploit this by embedding command-line options within the query string, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. The root cause is associated with the failure to skip a particular `php_getopt` function for the 'd' case.",
