CVE description: CVE-2021-43798 is a path traversal vulnerability in Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0, which can be exploited pre-authentication. The vulnerability arises from Grafana's failure to properly sanitize user-provided file paths in its public API endpoint, `/public/plugins/:pluginId`. This allows attackers to traverse directories and access sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or Grafana's SQLite database (`/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db`). The vulnerability can be exploited using crafted HTTP requests to read arbitrary files, potentially exposing user data, authentication tokens, and encrypted data source passwords. The vulnerability was patched in versions 8.3.1, 8.2.7, 8.1.8, and 8.0.7.
Attack Type: Path Traversal
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][grafana][['8.0.0-beta1---8.3.0']] Grafana is the main service vulnerable to CVE-2021-43798 due to a path traversal issue in its public API endpoint.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is used as a database service to store Grafana's data and configurations, although the vulnerability can also affect the SQLite database used by Grafana.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy to mitigate the vulnerability and manage HTTP requests to the Grafana service.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate that there is a configuration error in the Nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf). Specifically, the 'server' directive is not allowed at the location specified, which suggests a misconfiguration in the Nginx setup. This error prevents Nginx from starting correctly, and thus the container is not running as expected.
	- ERROR: The 'server' directive is incorrectly placed in the Nginx configuration file, leading to a syntax error.
	- FIX: The Nginx configuration file should be structured properly. Ensure the 'server' directive is placed within an 'http' block, which is missing in the provided configuration. Adding the 'http' block around the 'server' directive will resolve the error.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate that the container encountered an issue with the Nginx configuration. Specifically, there is an error stating that there is no 'events' section in the configuration file, which is required for Nginx to start correctly. This suggests that the configuration is incomplete or improperly set up.
	- ERROR: The Nginx configuration is missing the 'events' section, which is required for Nginx to start correctly. This section is necessary for basic Nginx operation and must be included in the configuration file.
	- FIX: Add the 'events' section to the Nginx configuration file. This section can be minimal, as it is required for Nginx to function but does not need to contain any specific directives for this setup.

Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!
