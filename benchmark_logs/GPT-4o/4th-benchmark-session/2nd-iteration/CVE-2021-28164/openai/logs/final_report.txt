CVE description: Eclipse Jetty is a widely used open-source web server and servlet container. In the vulnerable versions 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224, the default compliance mode allows requests with URIs containing encoded dot (`%2e`) or double dot (`%2e%2e`) segments to access protected resources, such as files in the `WEB-INF` directory. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information about the web application's configuration and implementation.
Attack Type: Unauthorized access to sensitive information by bypassing access controls through crafted URI requests.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetty][['9.4.37.v20210219', '9.4.38.v20210224']] This is the core component affected by CVE-2021-28164. Using one of the specified vulnerable versions is essential to replicate the vulnerability.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['11.0.10']] Jetty requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) to function. OpenJDK 11.0.10 is compatible with the vulnerable Jetty versions.
- [SOFT][nginx][['1.19.8']] While not strictly necessary, Nginx can serve as a reverse proxy to manage incoming requests to Jetty, facilitating a more realistic deployment scenario.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the Debian 'buster' repositories are no longer available at the specified URLs, resulting in a 404 Not Found error during the 'apt-get update' command.
	- FIX: Switch the base image to a more recent version of OpenJDK that uses a supported Debian release. This resolves the issue by ensuring that the package repositories are accessible and up-to-date.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is caused by using outdated Debian repositories in the Dockerfile. The 'buster' release repositories are no longer available, resulting in 404 errors when attempting to update the package lists.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we need to update the Dockerfile to use a supported Debian release for the OpenJDK base image. Since switching the base image did not work previously, another approach is to manually update the repository sources to a compatible archive mirror that still hosts the 'buster' packages.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The container is not running correctly because it failed to start the Jetty server. The error message 'ERROR : Nothing to start, exiting ...' indicates that the necessary configurations or applications required to start the server were not provided or found. The usage instructions suggest that the command to start the server was not executed with the correct options, properties, or configurations needed for Jetty to run.
	- ERROR: The Jetty server is not starting due to the lack of a proper start command or configuration. The error 'ERROR : Nothing to start, exiting ...' indicates that Jetty was not provided with the necessary configurations to initiate the server, likely due to missing or incorrect command-line arguments for starting Jetty.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the Jetty server is started with the proper configurations. This involves modifying the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile to use Jetty's start.jar with the appropriate arguments. Additionally, ensure the web application's directory structure is correctly set up so that Jetty can locate the web applications to serve.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate that the container attempted to start a Jetty server but failed due to a lack of configuration or startup commands. The error message 'Nothing to start, exiting ...' suggests that the necessary parameters or configuration files were not provided to initiate the Jetty server.
	- ERROR: The error 'Nothing to start, exiting ...' indicates that the Jetty server is not configured to start any applications or services. This typically happens when the Jetty server does not find any deployable web applications or is not properly instructed to start with the necessary configurations.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, ensure that the Jetty server is correctly configured to start the web application. This involves modifying the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile to explicitly specify the web application directory, ensuring Jetty can locate and deploy the web application. Additionally, verify that the Jetty server's configuration files are correctly set up to recognize the web application.

Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
