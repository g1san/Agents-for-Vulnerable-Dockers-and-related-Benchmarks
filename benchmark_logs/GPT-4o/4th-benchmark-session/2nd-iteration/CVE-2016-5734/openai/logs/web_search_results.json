    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 pertains to a security vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The issue arises from improper selection of delimiters in the `preg_replace` function, which fails to prevent the use of the 'e' (evaluate) modifier. This oversight allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by crafting specific strings, particularly through the table search-and-replace functionality. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity level. ([nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5734?utm_source=openai))",
    "attack_type": "This vulnerability enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system without requiring authentication. By exploiting the improper delimiter handling in the `preg_replace` function, an attacker can inject and execute malicious PHP code, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.",
