    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, commonly known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability discovered in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used Java-based logging utility. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a server by injecting malicious input that is subsequently logged by the application. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups within Log4j, enabling attackers to craft log messages that can trigger remote code execution. This issue affects Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 up to and including 2.14.1.",
