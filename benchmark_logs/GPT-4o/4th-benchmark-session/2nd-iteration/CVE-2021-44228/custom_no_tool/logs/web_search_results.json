    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical security vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, a widely used Java-based logging library. This flaw allows attackers to perform remote code execution by exploiting the library's handling of Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups. When a specially crafted log message is processed by a vulnerable Log4j 2 instance, it can trigger a lookup to an attacker-controlled LDAP server, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the affected server. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited over the internet without authentication, potentially leading to full system compromise. The affected versions range from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. Mitigation involves upgrading to a secure version of Log4j, disabling JNDI lookups, or removing the JndiLookup.class file.",
