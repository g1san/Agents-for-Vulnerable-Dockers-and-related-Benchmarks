CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability identified in OpenSMTPD version 6.6, utilized in OpenBSD 6.6 and various other products. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by sending specially crafted SMTP sessions. The vulnerability can be exploited by including shell metacharacters in the "MAIL FROM" field of an SMTP session. The issue arises due to improper input validation within the `smtp_mailaddr` function in `smtp_session.c`, where an incorrect return value upon validation failure permits the execution of unauthorized commands. This affects the default configuration of OpenSMTPD when it is uncommented.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd][['6.6.0', '6.6.1', '6.6.2']] OpenSMTPD is an open-source implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that is vulnerable in versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.2 due to improper input validation.
- [SOFT][debian][['10.0 (Buster)']] Debian 10.0 (Buster) serves as a compatible operating system environment for the OpenSMTPD service.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is due to the Debian Buster repositories being unavailable, leading to a failure in installing the specified version of OpenSMTPD.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we can switch to using the 'debian:10-slim' image, which is a lightweight version of Debian 10 (Buster) and should have the necessary repositories available. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct OpenSMTPD version is specified for installation.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the Debian Buster repositories are no longer available at the specified URLs, resulting in a 404 Not Found error. This is a common issue when using older Debian versions whose repositories have been moved or archived.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we will switch to using a newer Debian version that is still supported and has available repositories. We'll also ensure that the correct version of OpenSMTPD is installed. Since the CVE specifies OpenSMTPD version 6.6.0-2, we need to find a compatible Debian version or use an alternative method to install this package, such as downloading and installing from a specific archive or using a different repository. In this case, we'll use 'debian:11-slim' as the base image and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs due to a 404 Not Found response when attempting to download the OpenSMTPD package from the snapshot.debian.org archive. This indicates that the specific package version is no longer available at the specified URL.
	- FIX: To fix the error, we'll switch to using a different method to install OpenSMTPD version 6.6.0. We'll utilize a compatible package repository or download the package from an alternative source where it is still available. In this case, we'll switch to using the 'debian:10-slim' image, which aligns with the original environment of the CVE.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error message indicates that the repositories for Debian Buster (Debian 10) are no longer available, resulting in a 404 Not Found error during the apt-get update process. This prevents the successful installation of necessary packages, including wget and the OpenSMTPD package.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we will switch to using the 'snapshot.debian.org' to access the archived Debian Buster repositories. This approach ensures that we can still access the necessary packages for Debian 10, even though they are no longer available from the standard Debian mirrors. Additionally, we will ensure that the OpenSMTPD package is downloaded and installed properly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is caused by the expiration of the Debian snapshot repository's Release file, which is used to install OpenSMTPD. The snapshot date is too old, and the Release files are considered expired, leading to the Docker build failure.
	- FIX: To fix this, we can update the snapshot date to a more recent one where the Release files are still valid. We will choose a date closer to the current date while ensuring that the OpenSMTPD version 6.6.0 is still available in the snapshot repository. This will prevent the expiration error and allow the installation of the required packages.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The Docker build process fails due to expired Release files in the Debian snapshot repository. The error message indicates that the Release file for the security updates and updates repositories is expired, causing the `apt-get update` command to fail.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we will disable the Release file validity check using the `Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false` option in the `apt-get update` command. This allows us to bypass the expiration check and proceed with installing the necessary packages. Additionally, we will ensure the snapshot date is set to a time when the required packages are available.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' is typically caused by incorrect indentation or formatting in the YAML file, specifically in the docker-compose.yml file.
	- FIX: To fix the error, ensure that the YAML file is correctly formatted with proper indentation. YAML is indentation-sensitive, and incorrect indentation can cause parsing errors. The docker-compose.yml file should be checked for any misplaced colons or inconsistent spacing.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs is due to a 404 Not Found error when attempting to download the OpenSMTPD package from the specified snapshot.debian.org URL. This indicates that the package is no longer available at that location.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will replace the method of installing OpenSMTPD by using a local copy of the package. This ensures that the package is available even if it's not accessible from the Debian snapshot archive. We will include the OpenSMTPD package in the Docker context and update the Dockerfile to install it from the local file.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' typically indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file, such as improper indentation or misplaced colons.
	- FIX: The fix involves correcting the YAML syntax in the docker-compose.yml file by ensuring proper indentation and structure. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfile uses the correct package installation method and that all files are in the correct format.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
