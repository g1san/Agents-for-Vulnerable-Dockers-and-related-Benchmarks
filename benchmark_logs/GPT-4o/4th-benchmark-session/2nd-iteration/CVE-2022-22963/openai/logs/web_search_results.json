    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical security vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and all preceding unsupported versions. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely by exploiting the routing functionality, leading to unauthorized access to local resources due to insufficient validation of user-supplied SpEL expressions. This vulnerability is severe as it requires no authentication or user interaction, making it exploitable over a network.",
