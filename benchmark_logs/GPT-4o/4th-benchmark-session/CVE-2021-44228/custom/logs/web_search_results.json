    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability found in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used Java-based logging framework. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a server by exploiting the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) when specially crafted log messages are processed by Log4j. The issue arises from improper input validation, allowing remote code execution through LDAP, RMI, or other JNDI endpoints. This makes applications using vulnerable versions of Log4j susceptible to attacks, leading to potential full system compromise. The vulnerability affects versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1).",
