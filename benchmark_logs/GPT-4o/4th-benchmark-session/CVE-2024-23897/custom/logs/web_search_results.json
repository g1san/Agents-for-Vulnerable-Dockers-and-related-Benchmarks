    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability found in Jenkins, an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This vulnerability is an arbitrary file read issue that affects Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, including LTS versions 2.426.2 and earlier. The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of the args4j library's feature, 'expandAtFiles', which is enabled by default. This feature allows an '@' character followed by a file path in a command-line argument to be replaced with the file\u2019s contents. As a result, attackers with Overall/Read permission can read any file on the Jenkins controller's file system. Even attackers without this permission can read the first few lines of files, depending on the available CLI commands. This vulnerability can potentially lead to remote code execution when combined with other attack vectors, such as obtaining cryptographic keys from binary files. Jenkins has fixed this issue in versions 2.442, LTS 2.426.3, and LTS 2.440.1 by disabling the problematic feature. For those unable to update, disabling CLI access is recommended as a workaround.",
