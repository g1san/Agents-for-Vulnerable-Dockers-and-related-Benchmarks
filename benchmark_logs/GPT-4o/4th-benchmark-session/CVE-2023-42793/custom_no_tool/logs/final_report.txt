CVE description: CVE-2023-42793 is a critical vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity, a continuous integration and build management server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the TeamCity server by bypassing authentication mechanisms. The flaw is due to the misconfiguration of request interceptors, particularly those handling paths ending with "/RPC2", which disable authorization checks. This vulnerability affects all TeamCity versions up to and including 2023.05.3, but not TeamCity Cloud or versions patched to 2023.05.4 and beyond. The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild by advanced threat actors, including nation-state actors, to gain unauthorized access to systems, deploy malware, and potentially compromise sensitive data and software integrity.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetbrains/teamcity-server][['2023.05.3']] JetBrains TeamCity Server is the central component of the CI/CD system where the vulnerability resides. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting request interceptors that disable authorization checks.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['8.0']] MySQL is used as the database for storing TeamCity data, including build configurations and user information. It is required for a functional TeamCity setup.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Nginx is used as a reverse proxy server to handle HTTP requests and forward them to the TeamCity server. It facilitates secure and efficient web traffic management.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error logs indicate that the Docker build process is failing because the path to the nginx build context is not found. Specifically, the path "/home/gabriele/thesis-project/Agents-for-Vulnerable-Dockers-and-related-Benchmarks/dockers/CVE-2023-42793/custom_no_tool/nginx" does not exist, causing the build to terminate.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, ensure that the nginx directory exists at the specified path. This directory should contain the Dockerfile and any other necessary files for building the nginx image. Additionally, update the docker-compose.yml to remove the obsolete 'version' attribute to prevent warnings.

Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!
