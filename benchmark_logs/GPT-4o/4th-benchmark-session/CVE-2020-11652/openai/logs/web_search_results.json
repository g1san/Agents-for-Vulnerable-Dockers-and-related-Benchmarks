    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a security vulnerability identified in SaltStack's Salt software, specifically affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, which exposes certain methods that fail to properly sanitize file paths. This oversight permits authenticated users to perform path traversal attacks, granting them unauthorized access to arbitrary directories on the server.",
