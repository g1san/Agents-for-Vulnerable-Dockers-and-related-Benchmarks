    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability found in SaltStack, a configuration management and orchestration tool. This vulnerability affects the Salt Master service, allowing unauthorized users to read arbitrary files from the master server. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of user input, which permits path traversal attacks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute commands on both the master and minion servers, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the server environment. This vulnerability, along with CVE-2020-11651, can be exploited using Python scripts to access sensitive files, execute arbitrary commands, and upload files to specific locations on the server. It affects SaltStack versions earlier than 2019.2.4 and 3000.2.",
