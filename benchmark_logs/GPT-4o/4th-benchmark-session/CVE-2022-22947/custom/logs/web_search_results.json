    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a critical code injection vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Gateway, a component used for building API gateways. This vulnerability arises from improper input validation within the routing functionality of the gateway, specifically when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed, and unsecured. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host by sending a maliciously crafted request. The vulnerability affects versions of Spring Cloud Gateway prior to 3.0.7 and 3.1.1. It is rated with a CVSS v3 score of 10, indicating its critical severity, as it can be exploited over a network without authentication, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Exploits for this vulnerability are publicly available, and it has been known to be exploited in the wild.",
