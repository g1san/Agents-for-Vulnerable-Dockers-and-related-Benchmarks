Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs due to the unavailability of the 'snmp-mibs-downloader' package in the Debian repositories used by the Docker image. This package is either obsolete or not available in the current repositories, causing the build process to fail.
	- FIX: To fix the error, remove the 'snmp-mibs-downloader' package from the Dockerfile, as it is not essential for the basic operation of Cacti in this setup. The rest of the SNMP-related packages should suffice for SNMP functionality.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified branch '1.2.22' does not exist in the Cacti GitHub repository. This causes the git clone command to fail, as it cannot find the branch to check out.
	- FIX: To fix this error, update the Dockerfile to clone the correct branch or tag that exists in the Cacti repository. Since the goal is to demonstrate the vulnerability associated with version 1.2.22, and assuming this version is not available directly as a branch, we should check if a tag for this version exists or use the latest tag that is vulnerable. If no suitable tag is found, download the source code for version 1.2.22 directly from a reliable source if available. For this example, I will assume we need to use a different existing tag or the latest available vulnerable version.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- MILESTONE CHECK FAILURE (NOT VULNERABLE VERSION): The Cacti service is using version 1.2.18, which is not listed as a vulnerable version in the provided list ['0.6.8A', '0.8.6G', '0.8.8C', '1.2.22'].
	- ERROR: The remote_agent.php script contains a command injection vulnerability due to improper handling of input from the $_GET['poller_item'] parameter. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
	- FIX: To fix the vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize input parameters properly. Additionally, the use of proc_open should be avoided or handled securely to prevent command injection.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' typically indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file. In this case, the issue is due to the incorrect use of '\n' characters in the YAML content, which is causing the YAML parser to fail.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, replace the '\n' characters with actual newlines in the 'docker-compose.yml' file content. This will ensure the YAML parser can correctly interpret the structure of the file.

Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!
