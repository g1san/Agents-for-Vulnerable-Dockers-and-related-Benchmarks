    "desc": "CVE-2022-46169 is a critical security vulnerability found in Cacti, an open-source network monitoring tool. This vulnerability affects Cacti versions up to 1.2.22 and is due to improper sanitization of query arguments in HTTP requests associated with polling actions. The flaw is located in the 'remote_agent.php' file, where the IP address verification against the poller table can be bypassed, allowing unauthorized access. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and inject commands through the 'polldata' action, leading to remote code execution (RCE) as the www-data user. This is achieved by manipulating the 'poller_id' parameter in a GET request, which, if successful, executes arbitrary commands on the server. The vulnerability was patched in Cacti versions 1.2.23 and 1.3.0.",
