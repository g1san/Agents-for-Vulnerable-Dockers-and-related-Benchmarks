Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the Docker image 'jetty:9.4.42.v20210604-jre11-slim' is not found. This could be due to the image being removed or renamed in the Docker repository.
	- FIX: Update the Dockerfile to use a valid Jetty image version that is available in the Docker repository. Use Jetty version 9.4.43.v20210629-jre11-slim, which includes the fix for CVE-2021-28164.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the specified Jetty image version '9.4.43.v20210629-jre11-slim' cannot be found in the Docker repository. This is likely due to a typo or incorrect version string, as the correct Jetty version that includes the fix for CVE-2021-28164 is '9.4.43.v20210629'.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, the Dockerfile should be updated to use a valid Jetty image version that is available in the Docker repository. The correct version to use is 'jetty:9.4.43-jre11-slim', which includes the necessary security fix for CVE-2021-28164. Additionally, the 'version' attribute in the 'docker-compose.yml' file should be removed, as it is obsolete and ignored by Docker Compose.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- MILESTONE CHECK FAILURE (NOT VULNERABLE VERSION): The Docker image uses Jetty version 9.4.43.v20210629, which is not within the specified vulnerable version ranges for the 'code_hard_version' milestone. The vulnerable ranges are '9.4.37.v20210219---9.4.42.v20210604', '10.0.1---10.0.5', and '11.0.1---11.0.5'.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup is using Jetty version 9.4.43.v20210629, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-28164. The goal is to use a vulnerable version within the specified ranges to reproduce the issue.
	- FIX: To ensure the Docker system uses a vulnerable version of Jetty, modify the Dockerfile to specify a Jetty version that falls within the vulnerable range, such as 9.4.42.v20210604.

Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
