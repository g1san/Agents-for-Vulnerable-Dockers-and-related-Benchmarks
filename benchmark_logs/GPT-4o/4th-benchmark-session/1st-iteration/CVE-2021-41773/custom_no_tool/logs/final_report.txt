CVE description: CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. It allows a remote attacker to perform a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the directive 'require all denied', the requests can succeed, potentially exposing sensitive files. Moreover, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it can lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability was introduced in version 2.4.49 and was not properly fixed until version 2.4.51. The issue arises from a flaw in path normalization, which fails to properly handle encoded path traversal sequences, allowing attackers to bypass security checks. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild and is a result of an incomplete fix for a previous path traversal vulnerability.
Attack Type: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49']] Apache HTTP Server is the main service that contains the vulnerability CVE-2021-41773. The specific version 2.4.49 is directly affected by this vulnerability.
- [SOFT-OS][ubuntu][['20.04']] Ubuntu is used as the operating system to run the Apache HTTP Server. It provides the necessary environment and dependencies for the server to operate.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is due to the Docker build process not being able to find the 'html' directory, which is specified in the Dockerfile for copying into the Apache document root. This results in a failure to calculate the checksum needed for the build process.
	- FIX: Ensure that the 'html' directory exists in the build context. If it doesn't exist, create the directory and add the required files, such as 'index.html', into it. Additionally, remove the 'version' attribute from 'docker-compose.yml' as it is obsolete.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates a syntax error in the Apache configuration file located at /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf. Specifically, the 'CustomLog' directive is causing an issue. This could be due to a misspelling or because the module required to support this directive is not included in the server configuration.
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates a syntax error related to the 'CustomLog' directive in the Apache configuration. The issue is likely due to the absence of the 'log_config_module', which is required for the 'CustomLog' directive to function properly. This module is not loaded by default in the provided configuration.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to load the 'log_config_module' in the Apache configuration file. This module is responsible for handling the logging directives, including 'CustomLog'. By including this module, the syntax error should be resolved, allowing Apache to start successfully.
