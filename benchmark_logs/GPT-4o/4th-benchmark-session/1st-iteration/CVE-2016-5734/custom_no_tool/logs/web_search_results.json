    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, a widely used tool for managing MySQL databases. The issue arises from improper handling of parameters in the preg_replace() function within phpMyAdmin's table search-and-replace feature. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other severe impacts. The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. It specifically affects PHP versions before 5.4.7 where the 'e' modifier in preg_replace could be used to execute PHP code. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid credentials for phpMyAdmin. The issue was discovered by Michal \u010ciha\u0159 and Cure53 and mitigated in PHP 5.4.7 and above, which prevent code execution via preg_replace entirely.",
