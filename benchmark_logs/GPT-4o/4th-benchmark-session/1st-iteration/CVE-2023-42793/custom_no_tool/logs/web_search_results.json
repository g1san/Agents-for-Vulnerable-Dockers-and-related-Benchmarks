    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity, a continuous integration and build management server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the TeamCity server by bypassing authentication mechanisms. The flaw is due to the misconfiguration of request interceptors, particularly those handling paths ending with \"/RPC2\", which disable authorization checks. This vulnerability affects all TeamCity versions up to and including 2023.05.3, but not TeamCity Cloud or versions patched to 2023.05.4 and beyond. The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild by advanced threat actors, including nation-state actors, to gain unauthorized access to systems, deploy malware, and potentially compromise sensitive data and software integrity.",
