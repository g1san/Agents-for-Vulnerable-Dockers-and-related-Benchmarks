CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability identified in OpenSMTPD version 6.6, utilized in OpenBSD 6.6 and various other products. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by sending specially crafted SMTP sessions. The vulnerability can be exploited by including shell metacharacters in the "MAIL FROM" field of an SMTP session. The issue arises due to improper input validation within the `smtp_mailaddr` function in `smtp_session.c`, where an incorrect return value upon validation failure permits the execution of unauthorized commands. This affects the default configuration of OpenSMTPD when it is uncommented.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd][['6.6.0', '6.6.1', '6.6.2']] OpenSMTPD is an open-source implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that is vulnerable in versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.2 due to improper input validation.
- [SOFT][debian][['10.0 (Buster)']] Debian 10.0 (Buster) serves as a compatible operating system environment for the OpenSMTPD service.
This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the path '/home/gabriele/thesis-project/Agents-for-Vulnerable-Dockers-and-related-Benchmarks/dockers/CVE-2020-7247/openai/opensmtpd' does not exist, causing the build process to fail because it cannot find the necessary context to build the Docker image.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, ensure that the 'opensmtpd' directory exists and contains the necessary Dockerfile and any other required files. Additionally, remove the obsolete 'version' attribute from the 'docker-compose.yml' file as it is no longer needed.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is due to the Debian 10.0 (Buster) repositories being outdated and not having the required package files available. The 'apt-get update' command fails to fetch the package lists from the repositories because they no longer exist at the specified URLs.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to update the Dockerfile to use a more recent version of Debian that still supports the required package repositories. Alternatively, we can switch to using the 'buster' suite from the 'archive.debian.org' which retains older packages. Additionally, the configuration files should be updated to ensure compatibility with the specified versions of services.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specific version '6.6.0-1' of the 'opensmtpd' package is not found in the specified Debian Buster repositories. This version might have been removed or is not available in the archives being used.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we can modify the Dockerfile to download and build OpenSMTPD from its source code for version 6.6.0. This approach ensures that the exact version required for testing the CVE is used, independent of the package manager's availability.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error encountered during the Docker build process is a 404 Not Found error when attempting to download the OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 source tarball from the specified URL. This indicates that the file is no longer available at that location.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, I will use an alternative source for downloading OpenSMTPD 6.6.0. I will locate a different URL where the OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 source tarball is available. Additionally, I will ensure that the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are correctly configured to build and run the service.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the wget command is attempting to download a file from a URL that returns a 404 Not Found error. This indicates that the file is not available at the specified location.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will use an alternative source to download the OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 source code. Additionally, we will ensure all dependencies are correctly set up and address any potential issues with the Debian base image. We will also modify the Dockerfile to use a more reliable source for downloading the OpenSMTPD source code.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the './configure' script is not found. This typically happens when the necessary build scripts are not generated, possibly due to missing dependencies that are required to generate these scripts from the source code.
	- FIX: The solution is to install 'autoconf', 'automake', and 'libtool' packages, which are often needed to generate the 'configure' script from source code. These packages provide the necessary tools to set up the build configuration.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the file 'asr.h' is missing, which is required for building OpenSMTPD. This header file is part of the 'libasr' library, which is not installed by default in the Debian Buster image used in the Dockerfile.
	- FIX: To fix the error, we need to install the 'libasr-dev' package, which provides the 'asr.h' header file. This can be done by adding a command to install 'libasr-dev' in the Dockerfile before building OpenSMTPD.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the build process for OpenSMTPD fails because it cannot find a recent version of the LibreSSL libcrypto library. This is likely due to missing or outdated dependencies in the Debian Buster environment, which does not have the necessary LibreSSL version in its repositories.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the necessary libraries are available. Since Debian Buster may not have the required version of LibreSSL, we can switch to using OpenSSL, which is more commonly available. Additionally, we need to make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed. This involves modifying the Dockerfile to install OpenSSL and any other missing dependencies.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error 'configure: error: *** Can't find recent LibreSSL libcrypto (see config.log for details) ***' indicates that the LibreSSL libcrypto library is not found or is not recent enough for the build process. This is likely due to the use of an outdated Debian base image or missing dependencies.
	- FIX: To fix this, we will switch to using a more recent version of OpenSSL instead of LibreSSL, which is more commonly available and supported. We will ensure that all necessary OpenSSL development packages are installed before building OpenSMTPD.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
