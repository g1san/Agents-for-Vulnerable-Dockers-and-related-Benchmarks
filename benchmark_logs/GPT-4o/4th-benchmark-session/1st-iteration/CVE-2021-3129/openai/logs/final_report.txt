This vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of file operations within Ignition versions prior to 2.5.2.

Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['Compatible with Laravel 8.4.2 and earlier']] PHP is essential for executing the Laravel application, and its version compatibility is crucial for the presence of the vulnerability.
- [HARD][composer][['Compatible with Laravel 8.4.2 and earlier']] Composer is required for managing PHP dependencies, including the vulnerable Ignition library.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is used for database operations in Laravel applications. While not directly affecting the vulnerability, it is needed for a functional application environment.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.19']] Nginx serves as the web server for the Laravel application, necessary for a complete deployment environment but not directly influencing the vulnerability.Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
