{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability identified in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49, introduced due to a flaw in path normalization. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a path traversal attack, enabling access to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these external files are not protected by the default configuration directive \"require all denied,\" unauthorized access can occur. Furthermore, if Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are enabled for these aliased paths, the vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server. This issue is known to have been exploited in the wild. Notably, the fix provided in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, leading to the assignment of CVE-2021-42013.",
