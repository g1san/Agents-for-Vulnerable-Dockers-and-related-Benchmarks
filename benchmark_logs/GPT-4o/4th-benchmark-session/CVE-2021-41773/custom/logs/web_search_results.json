    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, where a flaw in path normalization allows a path traversal attack. An attacker can map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default \"require all denied\" configuration, the requests can succeed, potentially leading to remote code execution if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive information and potentially execute arbitrary code remotely. The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the path normalization process, which can be exploited to bypass security checks and access files outside the defined directory paths. This issue is exacerbated if the server is misconfigured with directives like \"Require all granted,\" and if the mod_cgi module is enabled, it can lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability was reported on September 29, 2021, and was known to be exploited in the wild. It was partially addressed in version 2.4.50 but fully fixed in version 2.4.51.",
