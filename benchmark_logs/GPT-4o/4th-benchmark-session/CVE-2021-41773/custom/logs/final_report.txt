CVE description: CVE-2021-41773 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, where a flaw in path normalization allows a path traversal attack. An attacker can map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default "require all denied" configuration, the requests can succeed, potentially leading to remote code execution if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive information and potentially execute arbitrary code remotely. The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the path normalization process, which can be exploited to bypass security checks and access files outside the defined directory paths. This issue is exacerbated if the server is misconfigured with directives like "Require all granted," and if the mod_cgi module is enabled, it can lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability was reported on September 29, 2021, and was known to be exploited in the wild. It was partially addressed in version 2.4.50 but fully fixed in version 2.4.51.
Attack Type: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49']] Apache HTTP Server is the vulnerable service in CVE-2021-41773, specifically version 2.4.49, which contains the path traversal flaw.
- [SOFT][debian][['bullseye']] Debian is used as the base operating system to run the Apache HTTP Server.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error presented in the logs indicates that the specific version '2.4.49-1' of the 'apache2' package could not be found in the Debian repositories. This is likely because the version is not available in the default repository of the specified Debian release ('bullseye').
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we will modify the Dockerfile to download the specific Apache 2.4.49 package from a different source, such as a snapshot or a direct download link, if available. Alternatively, we can build Apache from source if the package is not available in any repository. However, for simplicity and to ensure the vulnerability is reproducible, we will download the package directly from a snapshot repository that hosts older versions of Debian packages.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified URL to download Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 results in a 404 Not Found error. This means that the package is no longer available at the specified snapshot URL.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will change the approach and build Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 from source. This ensures that we can reproduce the vulnerability without relying on an unavailable package. We will update the Dockerfile to include the necessary steps to download the Apache HTTP Server source code, compile it, and install it.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the build process for Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 fails due to the absence of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and APR-util libraries, which are required for the build process. The `--with-included-apr` flag in the `./configure` command expects these libraries to be bundled within the source directory, but they are not present.
	- FIX: To fix the error, we need to download the APR and APR-util libraries and place them in the correct directory within the Apache source tree before running the `./configure` command. This involves modifying the Dockerfile to include additional steps for downloading and extracting these libraries into the appropriate location.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the build process is failing due to a missing dependency: 'expat.h'. This header file is part of the 'libexpat1-dev' package, which is required for the XML parsing capabilities of the APR-util library. The absence of this package causes the compilation of the 'apr_xml.c' file to fail, leading to the termination of the build process.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we need to install the 'libexpat1-dev' package in the Dockerfile before the build process of Apache HTTP Server begins. This will ensure that all necessary dependencies for compiling the APR-util library are available, allowing the build process to complete successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' typically indicates a syntax error in the YAML file, most likely due to incorrect indentation or formatting.
	- FIX: The issue can be fixed by ensuring that the YAML file is properly formatted. In this case, the YAML file 'docker-compose.yml' must be corrected for indentation and line breaks.

Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
