{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, a web-based MySQL database management tool, due to unsafe handling of parameters in the preg_replace() function. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code through the table search and replace feature, as phpMyAdmin does not properly sanitize these inputs. The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.x prior to 4.6.3, 4.4.x prior to 4.4.15.7, and 4.0.x prior to 4.0.10.16. This issue arises from phpMyAdmin's improper handling of delimiters, failing to prevent the use of the preg_replace function with the e (eval) modifier. Exploiting this vulnerability requires crafting inputs to ensure the first parameter matches the third, which is extracted from the database. Access to a valid token is necessary to exploit this vulnerability, as it is required for login.",
