    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a critical directory traversal vulnerability in Grafana, affecting versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0. This vulnerability allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on a Grafana server by exploiting improper path handling in the plugin asset serving functionality. Attackers can use crafted HTTP requests to access sensitive files, such as configuration files and databases, potentially leading to further exploitation like exfiltrating password hashes and gaining administrative access. The vulnerability was disclosed on December 3, 2021, and patched versions were released on December 7, 2021. However, many instances remain unpatched, making it a significant security risk.",
