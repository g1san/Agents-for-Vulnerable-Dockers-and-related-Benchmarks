    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Joomla! versions 4.0.0 to 4.2.7. It allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive information, such as MySQL database credentials, by bypassing access controls. This vulnerability can lead to information leakage, enabling attackers to manipulate the Joomla! database, change Super User passwords, and potentially gain administrative access. The flaw is particularly concerning for systems where MySQL is exposed to the internet, as attackers can use leaked credentials to execute further attacks, including code execution. Although the vulnerability is rated medium in severity, it has attracted significant attention due to its potential impact on Joomla! installations.",
