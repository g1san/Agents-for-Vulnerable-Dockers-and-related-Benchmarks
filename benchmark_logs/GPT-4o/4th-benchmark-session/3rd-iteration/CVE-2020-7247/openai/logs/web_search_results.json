    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability identified in OpenSMTPD version 6.6, utilized in OpenBSD 6.6 and various other products. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by sending specially crafted SMTP sessions. The vulnerability can be exploited by including shell metacharacters in the \"MAIL FROM\" field of an SMTP session. The issue arises due to improper input validation within the `smtp_mailaddr` function in `smtp_session.c`, where an incorrect return value upon validation failure permits the execution of unauthorized commands. This affects the default configuration of OpenSMTPD when it is uncommented.",
