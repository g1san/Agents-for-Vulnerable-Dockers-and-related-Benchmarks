    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Function framework, which allows for remote code execution due to improper input validation in the routing functionality. This vulnerability is found in versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. The flaw can be exploited through the misuse of the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) in the HTTP request header 'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression'. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host system, posing a significant security risk, especially to cloud serverless functions like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. The vulnerability was responsibly reported and has been addressed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.3. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to these versions to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",
