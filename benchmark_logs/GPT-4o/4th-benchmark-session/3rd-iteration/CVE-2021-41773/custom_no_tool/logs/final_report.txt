CVE description: CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. It allows a remote attacker to perform a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the directive 'require all denied', the requests can succeed, potentially exposing sensitive files. Moreover, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it can lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability was introduced in version 2.4.49 and was not properly fixed until version 2.4.51. The issue arises from a flaw in path normalization, which fails to properly handle encoded path traversal sequences, allowing attackers to bypass security checks. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild and is a result of an incomplete fix for a previous path traversal vulnerability.
Attack Type: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution
