    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical security vulnerability identified in Apache CouchDB versions prior to 3.2.2. This flaw arises from the database's default installation settings, which, if not properly secured, allow unauthorized users to access the system without authentication and obtain administrative privileges. The Apache CouchDB documentation has consistently recommended securing installations by implementing measures such as placing a firewall in front of all CouchDB instances.",
