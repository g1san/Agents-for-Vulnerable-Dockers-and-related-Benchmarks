{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical security vulnerability identified in the Ignition library, a popular error page and debugging tool used in Laravel and other PHP applications. This vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of file operations within Ignition versions prior to 2.5.2. Specifically, the library's improper use of PHP functions `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()` allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The exploitation of this vulnerability is contingent upon the application running in debug mode with Laravel versions before 8.4.2. When debug mode is enabled, Ignition's error handling mechanisms can be manipulated to perform unauthorized file operations, leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.0 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical severity.",
