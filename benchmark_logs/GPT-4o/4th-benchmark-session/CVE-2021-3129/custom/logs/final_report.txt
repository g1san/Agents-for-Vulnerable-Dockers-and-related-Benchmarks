CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a critical vulnerability in the Laravel framework, specifically within the Ignition debugging tool, which allows for remote code execution (RCE) by unauthenticated attackers. This vulnerability is present in Laravel versions up to 8.4.2 and Ignition versions before 2.5.2 when debug mode is enabled. The flaw arises from improper handling of deserialization in the Ignition package, leveraging insecure PHP functions like file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() without proper validation. Attackers can exploit this by sending crafted HTTP requests to the /_ignition/execute-solution endpoint, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized access. Mitigation involves updating Laravel and Ignition to secure versions, disabling debug mode in production, and implementing input validation.
