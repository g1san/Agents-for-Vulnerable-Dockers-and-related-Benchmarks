    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability found in Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. The vulnerability arises from the misuse of the routing functionality, which allows a user to input a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) as a routing expression. This can potentially lead to remote code execution and unauthorized access to local resources. The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request with specific headers, allowing execution of arbitrary commands. It is crucial to update to versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3 to mitigate this issue.",
