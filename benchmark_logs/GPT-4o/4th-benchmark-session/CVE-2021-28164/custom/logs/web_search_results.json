    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty that allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information due to improper input validation by the default compliance mode. Specifically, this vulnerability occurs when specially-crafted requests with URIs containing %2e or %2e%2e segments are sent, enabling unauthorized access to protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. This can lead to information disclosure, providing an attacker with sensitive data that could be used for further attacks against the affected system. The vulnerability affects Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224 and has a CVSS Base Score of 5.3, indicating a moderate level of severity. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, meaning it can be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. Users are advised to apply updates and fixes to mitigate the issue.",
