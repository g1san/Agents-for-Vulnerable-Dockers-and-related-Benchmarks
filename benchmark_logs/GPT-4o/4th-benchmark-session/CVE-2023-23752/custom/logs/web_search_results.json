    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is a security vulnerability in Joomla! versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7, characterized by an improper access check leading to an authentication bypass. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to leak privileged information, particularly MySQL database credentials, by exploiting endpoints that expose configuration data without requiring authentication. The vulnerability can potentially escalate to code execution if attackers change the Joomla! Super User password through the database, gaining administrative access and executing arbitrary code by modifying templates or installing malicious plugins. The issue is resolved in Joomla! version 4.2.8.",
