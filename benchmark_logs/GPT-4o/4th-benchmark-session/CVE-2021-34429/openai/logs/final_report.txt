Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the build context for the Jetty service is missing. Specifically, the path '/home/gabriele/thesis-project/Agents-for-Vulnerable-Dockers-and-related-Benchmarks/dockers/CVE-2021-34429/openai/jetty' cannot be found, which is required for building the Docker image.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, ensure that the 'jetty' directory exists at the specified path. If it does not, create the directory and include the necessary files for building the Jetty image. Additionally, update the 'docker-compose.yml' file to remove the obsolete 'version' attribute as suggested by the warning message.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error message indicates that the Docker build process cannot find the 'jetty' directory specified in the 'docker-compose.yml' file. This is likely because the path './jetty' is incorrect or the directory does not exist.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, ensure that the 'jetty' directory exists at the correct path and contains a Dockerfile. If the directory is misplaced or named incorrectly, adjust the path in the 'docker-compose.yml' file to point to the correct location.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the directory './webapps' is not found when trying to copy it into the Docker image. This is likely because the './webapps' directory does not exist in the context of the build, or it is not correctly placed relative to the Dockerfile.
	- FIX: To fix this error, ensure the './webapps' directory exists at the expected location and contains the necessary files. If it is missing, create the directory and add the necessary application files. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are properly aligned in terms of directory structure.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the './webapps' directory does not exist or is not accessible from the build context. The Docker build process is unable to find the specified directory to copy into the image, resulting in a failure to calculate the checksum.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, ensure that the './webapps' directory exists and contains the necessary files. Additionally, verify that the Docker build context is set correctly so the build process can locate the './webapps' directory. Adjust the directory structure and Dockerfile if needed to ensure the correct paths are used.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error message 'failed to calculate checksum of ref...: "/webapps": not found' indicates that the build process is unable to find the './webapps' directory in the context where the Docker build is being executed.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, ensure that the './webapps' directory exists in the correct location relative to the Docker build context. The build context is typically the directory where the Dockerfile is located, or it can be specified as part of the 'docker build' command. In this case, the './webapps' directory should be at the same level as the 'docker-compose.yml' file, which serves as the root of the build context. Additionally, ensure that the 'docker-compose.yml' file is correctly configured to use the specified build context.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error log indicates that the Docker build process is failing because the './webapps' directory is not found in the build context. This suggests that the directory is either missing or not correctly specified relative to the build context.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, ensure that the './webapps' directory exists at the correct location. The build context for the Dockerfile is the 'jetty' directory, so './webapps' should be placed inside this directory. Additionally, update the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to reflect the correct paths and build context.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the Docker build process is unable to find the 'webapps' directory needed for the COPY command in the Dockerfile. This is likely because the specified path './webapps' does not exist in the context of the Docker build. The build context is set to the directory where the Dockerfile is located, which is 'jetty'. Therefore, the 'webapps' directory should be inside the 'jetty' directory.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, ensure that the 'webapps' directory exists within the 'jetty' directory. This directory should contain the necessary application files that need to be copied into the Jetty container. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml reflect the correct paths and build context.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error logs indicate that the Docker build process is failing because it cannot find the './webapps' directory. The error message 'failed to calculate checksum of ref mop6trfhfs44n8t5zxwcaugiz::w58ftjs6h474mpfv475eu4zf5: "/webapps": not found' suggests that the build context does not include the './webapps' directory or that the path is incorrect.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, ensure that the './webapps' directory is correctly placed within the build context. The build context is set to the current directory ('.') in the 'docker-compose.yml' file. Therefore, the './webapps' directory should be at the same level as the 'docker-compose.yml' file. Additionally, update the Dockerfile path in the 'docker-compose.yml' to reflect the correct directory structure.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the path './webapps' specified in the Dockerfile for the COPY command does not exist. This could be due to the incorrect context path in the docker-compose.yml file or the absence of the 'webapps' directory in the expected location.
	- FIX: To fix the error, ensure that the 'webapps' directory is correctly placed relative to the docker-compose.yml file, and adjust the context path in the docker-compose.yml file accordingly. Additionally, update the Dockerfile to ensure the correct path is used.

Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
