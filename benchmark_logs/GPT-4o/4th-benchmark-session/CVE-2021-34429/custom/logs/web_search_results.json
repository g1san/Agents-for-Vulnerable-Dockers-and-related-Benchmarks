    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5 that allows for sensitive file disclosure through path traversal. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of encoded URIs, which can be exploited to access restricted files within the WEB-INF directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information without requiring authentication or user interaction, making it a moderate security risk. The vulnerability affects multiple systems using Jetty, including IBM InfoSphere Information Server, Oracle Communications Cloud Native Core products, and Dell Avamar. It is crucial to update to a patched version to mitigate the risk.",
