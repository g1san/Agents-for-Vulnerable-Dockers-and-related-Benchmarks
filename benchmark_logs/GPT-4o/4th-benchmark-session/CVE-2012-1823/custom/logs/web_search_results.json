    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical vulnerability in PHP's CGI implementation, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and retrieve source code from a server. The flaw arises due to improper handling of query strings by the PHP CGI when a URL lacks the '=' character, typically used to separate a parameter's name and value. This oversight enables attackers to pass additional arguments to the php-cgi binary, exploiting options like '-s' to display source code or '-d' to modify PHP configuration, leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability was first discovered by the Eindbazen team during a Capture The Flag event and took several months to be publicly disclosed after initial reporting. The issue affects PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2 when configured as a CGI script (php-cgi). Exploitation can be performed manually using HTTP requests or automated with tools like Metasploit, allowing unauthorized access and potential system compromise.",
