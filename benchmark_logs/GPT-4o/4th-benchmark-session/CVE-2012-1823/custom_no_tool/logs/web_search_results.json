    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical vulnerability found in PHP's CGI implementation, affecting PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of query strings in CGI-based setups, particularly when the query string lacks an '=' character. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands by injecting command-line options into the query string. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a URL that appends `?-s` to expose PHP script source code, revealing sensitive information like database credentials. Additionally, by sending PHP code in an HTTP request body and modifying PHP settings via the `-d` option, attackers can achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability is exacerbated on Windows systems using certain code pages, where a soft-hyphen can bypass the initial patch. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and control over affected systems, posing a significant security risk.",
