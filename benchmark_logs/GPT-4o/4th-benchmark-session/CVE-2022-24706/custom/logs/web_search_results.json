{
    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB, specifically affecting versions prior to 3.2.2. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to the use of a default 'monster' cookie for Erlang node communication, which is often left unchanged by administrators. Attackers can exploit this flaw by accessing the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) and using the default cookie to connect to CouchDB's network port, thereby gaining administrative privileges without authentication. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as it can lead to complete system compromise. It has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature. Public exploits are available, making it imperative for users to upgrade to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, change the default cookie, and implement firewall protections to mitigate this risk.",
