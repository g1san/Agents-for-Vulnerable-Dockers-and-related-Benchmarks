    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a remote code execution vulnerability in OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2, where the software fails to adequately escape dangerous characters from user-controlled input. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system by crafting a malicious SMTP session, specifically by using shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field. The vulnerability affects versions of OpenSMTPD after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2, and has been tested on several versions of OpenBSD, including 6.6, 6.5, 6.4, and 5.9. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect return value when input validation fails in the smtp_mailaddr function within smtp_session.c, affecting the \"uncommented\" default configuration.",
