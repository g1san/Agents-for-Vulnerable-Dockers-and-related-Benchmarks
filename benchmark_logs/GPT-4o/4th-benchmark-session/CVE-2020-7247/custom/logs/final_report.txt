CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a remote code execution vulnerability in OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2, where the software fails to adequately escape dangerous characters from user-controlled input. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system by crafting a malicious SMTP session, specifically by using shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field. The vulnerability affects versions of OpenSMTPD after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2, and has been tested on several versions of OpenBSD, including 6.6, 6.5, 6.4, and 5.9. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect return value when input validation fails in the smtp_mailaddr function within smtp_session.c, affecting the "uncommented" default configuration.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd][['6.6.0---6.6.2']] OpenSMTPD is the service that contains the vulnerability, and it is essential to create a system vulnerable to CVE-2020-7247.
- [SOFT][openbsd][['6.6']] OpenBSD is the operating system on which OpenSMTPD is running. It provides the necessary environment for OpenSMTPD to operate.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the Docker image 'openbsd:6.6' cannot be found in the Docker Hub registry. This is likely because there is no official OpenBSD image available on Docker Hub. The error message 'pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization' suggests that the image is either private or non-existent.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to replace the base image with a compatible Linux distribution that can run OpenSMTPD. We will use the 'alpine' image, which is lightweight and suitable for running OpenSMTPD. Additionally, we'll modify the Dockerfile to install the necessary OpenSMTPD version and dependencies on Alpine Linux. The 'docker-compose.yml' file will also be updated to remove the obsolete 'version' attribute.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file, typically due to improper formatting or indentation.
	- FIX: The issue can be fixed by correcting the formatting in the docker-compose.yml file. Specifically, ensure proper indentation and correct any syntax errors. Additionally, ensure the Dockerfile installs the specific vulnerable version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.2) and configure the smtpd.conf to match the vulnerable setup.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.2-r0) is not available in the current Alpine Linux package repository. The package manager is trying to resolve the dependency for opensmtpd=6.6.2-r0, but it only finds opensmtpd-7.7.0_p0-r0, causing a conflict.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we can modify the Dockerfile to use a specific version of Alpine Linux that includes the required OpenSMTPD version in its repository. Alternatively, we can manually download and install the specific version of OpenSMTPD from a previous Alpine Linux repository that contains it. In this case, we will use a specific Alpine version that contains the required OpenSMTPD package.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the specific version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.2-r0) is not available in the Alpine 3.11 repositories. The package manager is trying to resolve dependencies but cannot find the exact version specified, leading to a failure in the build process.
	- FIX: To resolve this, we will change the approach to manually downloading and installing the specific OpenSMTPD version. We'll use the 'wget' command to fetch the package from a known archive URL, then install it using 'apk'. This ensures we have the correct version of OpenSMTPD, even if it's not available in the current repository. Additionally, we'll modify the Dockerfile to handle this manual installation process.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error encountered during the Docker build process is a 404 Not Found error when trying to download the OpenSMTPD package from the Alpine Linux repository. This indicates that the specified version of the package is no longer available in the repository, likely due to it being outdated or removed.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we'll change the approach to manually downloading the specific OpenSMTPD version from a known archive URL where older packages are stored. We'll replace the outdated URL with a new one that points to a reliable archive source. Additionally, we'll ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed to support OpenSMTPD on Alpine Linux.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the wget command is unable to resolve the host address 'archive.alpinelinux.org'. This is likely due to DNS resolution issues or an outdated URL for the package download.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we will use a different approach that doesn't rely on downloading the package during the build process. Instead, we will use a base image that already includes the required version of OpenSMTPD. We will switch to an OpenBSD base image that includes OpenSMTPD. This avoids the need to manually download the package and resolves potential DNS or URL issues.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the Dockerfile is attempting to pull an OpenBSD 6.6 image from Docker Hub, which does not exist. This is causing the build process to fail because the base image cannot be found or accessed.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will switch to using an available Linux base image, such as Debian, which can run OpenSMTPD. We'll adjust the Dockerfile to install OpenSMTPD from the Debian repositories. This ensures compatibility and availability of the required packages. We'll also update the Docker Compose configuration to reflect any necessary changes for the new environment.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is caused by a failure in the Docker build process due to uninitialized values during the configuration of OpenSMTPD. The Perl warnings and the failure to determine the current runlevel suggest that the installation script is expecting interactive input, which is not available in the Docker build context.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will preconfigure the necessary package settings using the DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive environment variable to suppress interactive prompts during the installation of OpenSMTPD. Additionally, we will use the 'debconf-set-selections' command to preconfigure the required values for the OpenSMTPD package setup.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the command to install OpenSMTPD and configure it is failing with an exit code 255. This is likely due to the interactive service startup scripts being blocked by 'policy-rc.d', which is a common issue when installing packages in a Docker environment that require service management.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will modify the Dockerfile to disable the service startup scripts during the package installation process. This can be done by setting up a 'policy-rc.d' script that denies the execution of service start commands. Additionally, we'll ensure that the correct version of OpenSMTPD is installed by specifying the version explicitly. We'll also remove the unnecessary postfix configuration commands, as they are not needed for OpenSMTPD.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
