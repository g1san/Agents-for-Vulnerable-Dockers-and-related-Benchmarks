    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 and 9.4.38.v20210224. In these versions, the default compliance mode allows requests with URIs containing `%2e` or `%2e%2e` segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. For example, a request to `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the `web.xml` file, potentially revealing sensitive information about the web application's implementation.",
