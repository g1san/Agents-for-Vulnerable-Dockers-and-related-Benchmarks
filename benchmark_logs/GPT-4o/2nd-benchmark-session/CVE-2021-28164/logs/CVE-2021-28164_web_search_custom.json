    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty, a widely used open-source web server and servlet container. The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. It arises from the default compliance mode, which allows requests with URIs containing %2e or %2e%2e segments to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, such as web.xml, potentially exposing sensitive information about the web application's implementation. The issue is documented in security advisories and has been addressed in subsequent updates.",
