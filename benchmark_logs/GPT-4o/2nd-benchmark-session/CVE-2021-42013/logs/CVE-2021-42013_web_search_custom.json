    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The vulnerability arises from an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-41773, allowing attackers to perform a path traversal attack. This can enable them to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default \"require all denied\" configuration, the requests can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability does not affect versions earlier than 2.4.49.",
