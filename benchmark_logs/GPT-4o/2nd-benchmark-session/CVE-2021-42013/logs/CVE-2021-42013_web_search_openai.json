    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 addresses an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. An attacker could exploit a path traversal vulnerability to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" the requests can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these aliased paths, remote code execution is possible. This issue affects only Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50.",
