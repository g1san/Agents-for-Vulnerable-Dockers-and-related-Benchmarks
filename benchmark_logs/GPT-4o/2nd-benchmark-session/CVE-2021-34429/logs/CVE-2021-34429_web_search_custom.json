    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty that allows sensitive file disclosure through path traversal. The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. It allows URIs to be crafted using encoded characters to access the content of the WEB-INF directory, potentially exposing sensitive information such as the `web.xml` file. The issue arises from changes in URI parsing that made it compliant with RFC standards, inadvertently allowing access to protected resources. The vulnerability is mitigated in versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6.",
