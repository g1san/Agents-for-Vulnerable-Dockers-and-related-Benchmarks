Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section where 'Running' is false and 'ExitCode' is 1, which typically signifies an error occurred during startup. The service 'httpd' is correctly identified, and the version used is 2.4.49, which matches the required version.
	Error: The Docker container is failing to start due to a missing or misconfigured configuration file, specifically the 'httpd.conf'. The error could be related to incorrect module loading or directory permissions.
	Fix: Ensure that the 'httpd.conf' file is correctly configured and that all necessary modules are loaded. Additionally, check that the directory permissions are set correctly to allow the Apache server to access required directories.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the Docker image 'httpd:2.4.49-CVE-2021-41773' could not be found in the Docker Hub registry. This is because the image tag '2.4.49-CVE-2021-41773' does not exist in the official httpd repository.
	Fix: To fix the error, we need to create a custom Dockerfile that builds the Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 and explicitly apply the necessary configurations to simulate the CVE-2021-41773 vulnerability. We will then build the image locally and use it in the Docker Compose file.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly. The 'State' field in the logs shows 'Status': 'exited', 'Running': False, and 'ExitCode': 1, indicating that the container has stopped running due to an error. The service specified ('httpd') is present, and the version used is 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirements.
	Error: The error is likely due to the Apache HTTP Server configuration or the Docker setup not being correctly aligned with the expected environment for the httpd service to run smoothly. The 'ExitCode': 1 indicates a generic error, often due to misconfiguration or missing dependencies.
	Fix: To fix the issue, make sure that all necessary Apache modules are loaded and configured correctly, the directory permissions are appropriate, and the Docker setup is correctly mapping the volumes and ports. Additionally, ensure that the configuration files are correctly formatted and that the Apache service has the necessary permissions to access the required directories.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section where 'Running' is 'False' and 'ExitCode' is '1'. This suggests that the container has exited with an error. The service 'httpd' is correctly used, and the version '2.4.49' matches the specified version.
	Error: The container is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates a configuration error in the Apache HTTP Server setup. The error could be due to incorrect permissions, missing modules, or misconfigured directives in the 'httpd.conf' file.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the Apache HTTP Server can start without errors by checking the 'httpd.conf' configuration. We need to modify the Docker setup to ensure proper permissions and configurations are in place. Additionally, since the error might be related to the configuration, we should verify the syntax of 'httpd.conf' and ensure that all necessary modules are loaded and configured correctly.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container is not running correctly because its status is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during execution. However, the container uses the 'httpd' service, and the version of 'httpd' is 2.4.49, which is the specified version to check against.
	Error: The Docker container exits with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file. Specifically, the configuration file might be missing necessary modules or has incorrect directory permissions that prevent Apache from starting properly.
	Fix: The issue was fixed by ensuring that the necessary modules are loaded and that directory permissions are properly configured. Additionally, I ensured that the configuration file paths and permissions are correct to allow Apache to start without errors.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs**: The container is not running correctly. The 'State' section of the logs indicates that the container has 'exited' with an 'ExitCode' of 1, which typically signifies an error during execution.

2. **Services Ok**: The service 'httpd' is present in the 'Image' field and the 'Cmd' field indicates it is intended to run 'httpd-foreground'.

3. **Code Main Version**: The version of 'httpd' used is 2.4.49, which matches the required version.
	Error: The container exited with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the httpd.conf file, specifically the lack of necessary modules or incorrect permissions that prevent Apache from starting.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the necessary modules are loaded and that the directory permissions are correctly set. Additionally, modify the Dockerfile to include a command that verifies the syntax of the httpd.conf file before starting the Apache service, preventing the container from exiting due to configuration errors.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates a syntax error in the Apache configuration file 'httpd-vhosts.conf'. Specifically, the 'CustomLog' command is invalid, possibly because the 'log_config_module' is not loaded. Additionally, there is a warning about a non-existent DocumentRoot directory for a dummy host, which might not be critical but should be addressed.
	Fix: To fix the error, the 'log_config_module' should be loaded in the 'httpd.conf' file to support the 'CustomLog' directive. Additionally, ensure that the 'httpd-vhosts.conf' file is properly configured and that any referenced directories exist or are correctly set up.========== Test Passed!
