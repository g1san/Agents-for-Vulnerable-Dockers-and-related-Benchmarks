    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical vulnerability affecting JetBrains TeamCity, a widely used continuous integration and build management server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on the TeamCity server by bypassing authentication mechanisms. The flaw arises from a misconfigured request interceptor that fails to enforce authorization checks on certain paths, specifically those ending with \"/RPC2\". By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can create a new user with administrative privileges, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially gain full control over the server. This includes the ability to steal sensitive data such as source code, service secrets, and private keys, as well as manipulate build agents and artifacts. The vulnerability was discovered on September 6, 2023, and has been actively exploited by advanced persistent threat groups, including APT29. JetBrains released a fix in version 2023.05.4, and users are advised to update immediately to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",
