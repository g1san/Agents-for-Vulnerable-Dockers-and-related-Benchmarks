    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity, a build management and continuous integration server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on TeamCity servers through remote code execution. The issue is due to an authentication bypass in TeamCity server versions 2023.05.3 and below. Exploiting this vulnerability could enable attackers to steal source code, access service secrets and private keys, control build agents, and compromise build artifacts. The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild, with threat actors using it to gain initial access to networks and deploy malware. JetBrains addressed the issue with a patch in TeamCity version 2023.05.4, and it does not affect TeamCity Cloud. Users are advised to update their installations to the patched version to mitigate risks.",
