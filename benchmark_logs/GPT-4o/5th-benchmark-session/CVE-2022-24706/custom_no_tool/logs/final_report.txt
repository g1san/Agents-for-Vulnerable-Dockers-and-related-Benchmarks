CVE description: CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. It allows attackers to gain administrative privileges without authentication due to an improperly secured default installation. This vulnerability arises from CouchDB's default cookie value used for authentication between Erlang nodes, which was not adequately secured. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The vulnerability is easily exploitable, with public scripts available to leverage the default cookie value, 'monster,' to connect and execute commands on CouchDB. To mitigate this issue, users are advised to update to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, set up a firewall, and ensure the distribution port is not exposed externally. The update binds epmd and CouchDB distribution ports to localhost, forcing users to change the default cookie. The vulnerability was identified by Alex Vandiver and has a CVSSv3 score of 9.8.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error indicates an invalid node name configuration for the CouchDB instance. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@localhost' is incorrectly formatted, likely due to a misconfiguration in the environment variables or the configuration file. The node name should follow the pattern 'name@hostname', where 'name' is the name of the node and 'hostname' is the actual host name or IP address where it is running. Correcting this configuration should resolve the issue.
	- ERROR: The error is caused by an incorrect node name configuration in the CouchDB service. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@localhost' is incorrectly formatted, likely due to a misconfiguration in the environment variables or the configuration file. The node name should follow the pattern 'name@hostname', where 'name' is the name of the node and 'hostname' is the actual host name or IP address where it is running.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, the node name should be correctly set in the environment variables of the CouchDB service. The 'NODENAME' environment variable should be set to 'couchdb@<hostname>', where '<hostname>' is the name of the service defined in the docker-compose.yml file, which in this case is 'couchdb'. Therefore, the correct node name should be 'couchdb@couchdb'.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error in the logs indicates an issue with the CouchDB configuration, specifically an invalid node name format 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb'.

	- FIX: To fix the issue, the node name should be correctly set in the environment variables of the CouchDB service. The 'NODENAME' environment variable should be set to 'couchdb@<hostname>', where '<hostname>' is the name of the service defined in the docker-compose.yml file, which in this case is 'couchdb'. Therefore, the correct node name should be 'couchdb@couchdb'. Additionally, ensure that the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates a misconfiguration in the CouchDB setup. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' is incorrectly formatted. Typically, it should be in the format 'name@hostname', but the repetition suggests a configuration error or a misinterpretation of environment variables.
	- ERROR: The error was due to an incorrect node name format in the CouchDB service configuration. The node name was incorrectly set as 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb', which caused the misconfiguration. This issue likely arose from a misunderstanding of how the node name should be structured in the CouchDB environment settings.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, the 'NODENAME' environment variable should be set correctly. The node name should be in the format 'couchdb@<hostname>', where '<hostname>' is the name of the service defined in the docker-compose.yml file. In this case, it should be 'couchdb@couchdb'. Additionally, ensure that the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error 'Protocol 'inet_tcp': invalid node name: couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' suggests there is a misconfiguration in the node name for the CouchDB instance. The node name appears to be incorrectly formatted or duplicated, which can prevent the CouchDB service from starting properly. This needs to be corrected in the configuration to ensure the container runs correctly.
	- ERROR: The error 'Protocol 'inet_tcp': invalid node name: couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' is caused by an incorrect formatting of the node name in the configuration. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' is malformed because it includes an extra '@couchdb' suffix, leading to an invalid node name configuration.
	- FIX: To fix this error, the node name should be set correctly in the environment variables of the CouchDB service. The 'NODENAME' environment variable should be set to 'couchdb@<hostname>', where '<hostname>' is the name of the service defined in the docker-compose.yml file. In this case, it should be 'couchdb@localhost' or 'couchdb@127.0.0.1' to ensure proper configuration. This will resolve the misconfiguration and allow the CouchDB service to start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates that there is an issue with the node name configuration for CouchDB. It appears that the node name is incorrectly set to 'couchdb@couchdb@localhost', which is not a valid format. The correct format should be 'couchdb@localhost' or another valid hostname. This misconfiguration is causing the container to fail.
	- ERROR: The node name configuration for CouchDB is incorrect, causing the container to fail. The error message indicates that the node name is set to 'couchdb@couchdb@localhost', which is an invalid format. The correct format should be 'couchdb@localhost' or another valid hostname.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, ensure the node name is set correctly in the environment variables of the CouchDB service. The 'NODENAME' environment variable should be set to 'couchdb@127.0.0.1' to ensure proper configuration. This change will resolve the misconfiguration and allow the CouchDB service to start correctly. Additionally, ensure that the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates that there is an issue with the node name configuration for the CouchDB instance. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@127.0.0.1' is improperly formatted, likely due to a misconfiguration where the node name is being duplicated. The correct format should be 'couchdb@127.0.0.1' or similar, depending on the intended setup. This misconfiguration prevents the CouchDB service from starting correctly.
	- ERROR: The error is due to an incorrectly formatted node name 'couchdb@couchdb@127.0.0.1', which is caused by a misconfiguration in the 'NODENAME' environment variable. This misconfiguration prevents CouchDB from starting properly.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, the 'NODENAME' environment variable should be set correctly. Since the service name is 'couchdb', the node name should be 'couchdb@couchdb'. Additionally, ensure that the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access. Also, make sure the CouchDB service is properly isolated by binding it to 'localhost'.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message 'Protocol 'inet_tcp': invalid node name: couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' indicates a misconfiguration in the Erlang node name, which is likely used by the CouchDB instance. The node name seems to be incorrectly set to 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb', which is not a valid format. The expected format should be 'name@hostname'. This misconfiguration is preventing the container from running correctly.
	- ERROR: The error 'Protocol 'inet_tcp': invalid node name: couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' indicates that the NODENAME environment variable is incorrectly set. It is being interpreted as having multiple '@' symbols, which is not a valid node name format. The format should be 'name@hostname'.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, the node name should be set to a valid format. Given that the service name is 'couchdb', we should ensure that the NODENAME reflects a valid hostname. A common practice is to use 'couchdb@localhost' or 'couchdb@127.0.0.1' to ensure the node name is recognized correctly. Additionally, ensure the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error in the logs indicates an issue with the node name configuration for CouchDB. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@localhost' is incorrectly formatted, likely due to a duplication or misconfiguration in the hostname or domain settings. This prevents CouchDB from starting correctly.
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates an issue with the node name configuration for CouchDB. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@localhost' is incorrectly formatted, likely due to a duplication or misconfiguration in the hostname or domain settings. This prevents CouchDB from starting correctly.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure the 'NODENAME' environment variable is set correctly. Instead of using 'localhost' or a static IP, we should use the service name as the hostname part of the node name. This ensures that the node name is correctly recognized within the Docker network. Additionally, we need to ensure that the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates a problem with the node name configuration for the CouchDB instance. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' is invalid, likely due to an incorrect configuration setting where the node name is being constructed improperly. This could be a result of a misconfigured environment variable or a typographical error in the configuration file.
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the node name 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' is invalid. This is likely caused by an incorrect configuration of the 'NODENAME' environment variable, where the node name is being constructed with an additional '@couchdb' suffix, resulting in an erroneous format.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, ensure that the 'NODENAME' environment variable is set correctly. The node name should be in the format 'couchdb@<hostname>', where '<hostname>' is the hostname or IP address that the CouchDB service can resolve within the Docker network. In this case, we should use 'couchdb@couchdb' since the service name is 'couchdb'. Additionally, ensure that the Erlang cookie is set to a secure, non-default value to prevent unauthorized access.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates that there is an issue with the node name configuration for the CouchDB instance running in the container. The node name 'couchdb@couchdb@couchdb' is invalid due to the repeated '@couchdb' part, which is likely a misconfiguration. The correct format should be 'couchdb@hostname', where 'hostname' is the network address or name of the machine running the container. This misconfiguration is preventing the CouchDB service from starting correctly.
