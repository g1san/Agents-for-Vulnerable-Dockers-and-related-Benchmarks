    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB, identified as a remote code execution (RCE) flaw. This vulnerability affects versions 3.2.1 and below of CouchDB and allows attackers to gain administrative privileges without authentication. The issue arises from CouchDB's default installation settings, where a random network port is opened for clustered operations, advertised by the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) on a fixed port. The default cookie value used for authentication between Erlang nodes is not secure, allowing unauthorized access. Attackers can exploit this by connecting to the EPMD and using the default cookie to execute commands. The vulnerability was identified by Alex Vandiver and has a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, indicating its severity. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to upgrade to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, use a firewall, and ensure only the necessary port 5984 is exposed for single-node installations.",
