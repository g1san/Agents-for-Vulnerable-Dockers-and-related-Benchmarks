    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. It allows attackers to gain administrative privileges without authentication due to an improperly secured default installation. This vulnerability arises from CouchDB's default cookie value used for authentication between Erlang nodes, which was not adequately secured. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The vulnerability is easily exploitable, with public scripts available to leverage the default cookie value, 'monster,' to connect and execute commands on CouchDB. To mitigate this issue, users are advised to update to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, set up a firewall, and ensure the distribution port is not exposed externally. The update binds epmd and CouchDB distribution ports to localhost, forcing users to change the default cookie. The vulnerability was identified by Alex Vandiver and has a CVSSv3 score of 9.8.",
