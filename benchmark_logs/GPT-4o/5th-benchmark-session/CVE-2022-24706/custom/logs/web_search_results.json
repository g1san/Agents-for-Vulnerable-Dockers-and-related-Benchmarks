    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical security vulnerability in Apache CouchDB, affecting versions prior to 3.2.2. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute remote code and gain administrative privileges without authentication, primarily due to insecure default configuration settings. CouchDB uses the Erlang distribution protocol for communication between nodes, which relies on a default \"cookie\" value for authentication. Attackers can exploit this default \"cookie\" to execute arbitrary scripts, as CouchDB advertises network ports using epmd, which are accessible due to these insecure settings. The vulnerability is rated with a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, indicating its high severity and ease of exploitation. Public exploits exist that leverage this setup, making it a significant threat. Mitigation involves upgrading to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, changing the default \"cookie\" value, and configuring firewalls to restrict access to CouchDB ports.",
