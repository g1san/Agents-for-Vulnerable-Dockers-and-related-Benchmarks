    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical security vulnerability identified in Apache CouchDB versions prior to 3.2.2. This flaw allows an attacker to access an improperly secured default installation without authentication and gain administrative privileges. The vulnerability arises from two primary configuration issues in CouchDB's default setup: Erlang Distribution Port Exposure and Default Erlang Cookie Value. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can gain administrative privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise, including arbitrary code execution.",
