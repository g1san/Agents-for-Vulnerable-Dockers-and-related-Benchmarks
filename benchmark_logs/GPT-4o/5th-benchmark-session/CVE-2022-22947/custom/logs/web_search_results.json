{
    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway, a component of the Spring framework used for building API gateways. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to improper input validation in the Gateway Actuator endpoint. Specifically, when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed, and unsecured, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the system, as the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host. The vulnerability affects versions 3.1.0, 3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and older unsupported versions of Spring Cloud Gateway. The critical nature of this vulnerability is underscored by its CVSS score of 10.0, the highest level of severity. To mitigate the risk, users are advised to upgrade to versions 3.1.1+ or 3.0.7+, and to secure or disable the Actuator endpoint if it is not necessary.",
