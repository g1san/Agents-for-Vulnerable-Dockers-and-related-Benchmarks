    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a security vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 due to improper path normalization. This allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks, accessing files outside the intended document root. If these files lack explicit access restrictions, they can be retrieved by the attacker. Moreover, if CGI scripts are enabled, the vulnerability can escalate to remote code execution, allowing arbitrary command execution on the server. This issue is actively exploited and is specific to version 2.4.49.",
