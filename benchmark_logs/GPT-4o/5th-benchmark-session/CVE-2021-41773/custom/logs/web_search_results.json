{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, where a flaw in path normalization allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks. This can result in file disclosure and potential remote code execution if the server is configured to allow CGI scripts. The vulnerability arises from a change made in version 2.4.49, which introduced the flaw. It allows attackers to map URLs to files outside the expected document root if those files are not protected by 'require all denied'. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, with the latter version having an incomplete fix. The vulnerability is exploitable if the server is configured with specific settings that do not restrict access to sensitive files, and it has been actively exploited in the wild.",
