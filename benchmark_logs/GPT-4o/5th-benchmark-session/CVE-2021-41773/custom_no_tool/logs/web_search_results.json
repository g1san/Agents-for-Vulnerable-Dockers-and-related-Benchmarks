    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a critical vulnerability affecting Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This flaw is due to improper path normalization, which allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can map URLs to files outside the expected document root if these files are not protected by the \"require all denied\" directive. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive information. Furthermore, if CGI scripts are enabled in these exposed directories, attackers may achieve remote code execution, allowing them to run arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited remotely without authentication, making systems highly susceptible to unauthorized access and manipulation. The issue was actively exploited in the wild, and a complete fix was provided in version 2.4.51 or later.",
