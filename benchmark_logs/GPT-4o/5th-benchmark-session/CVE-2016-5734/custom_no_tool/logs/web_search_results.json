    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, a widely-used web-based MySQL database management tool. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of parameters in the `preg_replace()` function, specifically the use of the 'e' (eval) modifier. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code through crafted strings, exploiting the table search-and-replace feature. The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. Exploitation requires authenticated access to phpMyAdmin and can lead to remote code execution, potentially allowing attackers to take control of the server or access sensitive data. The issue is mitigated in later versions of phpMyAdmin and PHP versions 5.4.6 and newer, which disallow null termination in `preg_replace`, and PHP 7.0 and above, which prevent code execution in `preg_replace`.",
