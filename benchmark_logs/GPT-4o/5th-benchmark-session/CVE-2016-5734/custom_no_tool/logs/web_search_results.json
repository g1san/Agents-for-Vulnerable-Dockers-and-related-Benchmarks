{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, a popular web-based tool for managing MySQL databases. The flaw exists in the table search-and-replace functionality, where improper handling of parameters in the `preg_replace()` function allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code. This is due to the unsafe use of the `preg_replace` function's `e` modifier, which is synonymous with `eval`. The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to compromise the server or access sensitive data.",
