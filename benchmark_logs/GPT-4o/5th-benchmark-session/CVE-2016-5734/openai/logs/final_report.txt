CVE description: CVE-2016-5734 is a critical security vulnerability in phpMyAdmin that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code due to improper delimiter selection in the `preg_replace` function. The vulnerability affects versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. Attackers can exploit this via the table search-and-replace functionality, leading to a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.0.10.15', '4.4.15.6', '4.6.2']] phpMyAdmin is the primary service vulnerable to CVE-2016-5734, allowing remote code execution through improper delimiter handling in `preg_replace`.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7.34']] MySQL serves as the database backend required by phpMyAdmin to function properly.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.19.10']] Nginx acts as the web server to handle HTTP requests for phpMyAdmin.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the Docker image for phpMyAdmin version 4.6.2 is not found on Docker Hub. This is causing the build process to fail.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, the Docker Compose file should be updated to use a valid phpMyAdmin image version that is available on Docker Hub. Since the CVE affects phpMyAdmin 4.6.2 and earlier versions, it's important to select a version that is still vulnerable for testing purposes but is available on Docker Hub. Alternatively, you can build a custom Docker image for phpMyAdmin 4.6.2 if it's not available.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the specified phpMyAdmin image version 4.4.15.6 is not found on Docker Hub, leading to a failure in pulling the image and thus causing the Docker Compose process to terminate.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we will update the Docker Compose file to use a phpMyAdmin image version that is available on Docker Hub. Since the CVE affects versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3, we can use version 4.4.15.7, which is still vulnerable but available. This will allow us to proceed with testing the vulnerability.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error indicates that the Docker image for phpMyAdmin version 4.4.15.7 is not found on Docker Hub. This version is not available, causing the service to fail during the image pull process.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we will modify the Docker Compose file to use a valid phpMyAdmin image version that is available on Docker Hub and still vulnerable to CVE-2016-5734. The CVE affects versions up to 4.6.2, so we will use version 4.6.2, which is available and still vulnerable for testing purposes.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error presented by the logs is that the Docker image for phpMyAdmin version 4.6.2 could not be found on Docker Hub. This is likely because this specific version has been removed or is not available for download.
	- FIX: To fix the error, we will build a custom Docker image for phpMyAdmin version 4.6.2 using a Dockerfile. This approach ensures that we have the specific version required for testing the CVE vulnerability. The Dockerfile will be created to download the phpMyAdmin 4.6.2 source code and configure it appropriately.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error is due to the Debian Stretch repositories being outdated and no longer available, which leads to a failure during the `apt-get update` step in the Dockerfile.
	- FIX: To fix this, we need to switch to a newer base image that has access to supported repositories. We will update the Dockerfile to use a newer version of PHP that is compatible with phpMyAdmin 4.6.2. We will also update the repository URLs to point to an archived or alternative source if needed.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the 'mv' command attempts to move the extracted phpMyAdmin directory to the same location where it already exists, resulting in a conflict.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, the Dockerfile should be updated to extract phpMyAdmin directly into the target directory '/var/www/html' to avoid the need for the 'mv' command. This will prevent the error and allow the build process to continue successfully.
