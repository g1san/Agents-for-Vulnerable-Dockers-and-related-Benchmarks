    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a critical security vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin, a popular web-based MySQL database management tool. The vulnerability affects several versions of phpMyAdmin, specifically versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The issue arises from improper delimiter selection that fails to prevent the use of the `preg_replace` function with the `e` (eval) modifier. This oversight allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code through a crafted string, particularly by exploiting the table search-and-replace implementation. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid phpMyAdmin credentials and can execute arbitrary PHP commands through the application's interface. The exploit involves creating a SQL table and utilizing a find-and-replace operation with a crafted payload to execute the desired commands. This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper input validation and regular updates to software to mitigate potential security risks.",
