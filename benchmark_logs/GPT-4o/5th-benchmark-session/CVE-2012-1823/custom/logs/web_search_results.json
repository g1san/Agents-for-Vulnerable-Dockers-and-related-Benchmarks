{
    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability found in the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) component of PHP. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting improper handling of command-line arguments. This vulnerability is specifically related to how PHP is configured to run in CGI mode. When a URL lacks the '=' character, attackers can inject command-line arguments through URLs, enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This flaw allows attackers to bypass security restrictions and potentially take control of the affected system. It was discovered by Eindbazen during the Nullcon Capture The Flag event and gained notoriety due to its exploitation potential. The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2. Exploitation can be performed manually using tools like Burp Suite or automated with Metasploit, highlighting the critical need for proper input handling and timely patching in software security.",
