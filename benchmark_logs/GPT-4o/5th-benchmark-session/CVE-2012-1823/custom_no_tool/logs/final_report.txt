CVE description: CVE-2012-1823 is a critical vulnerability in the PHP CGI component, which stems from improper handling of command-line arguments when PHP is configured to operate in a CGI-based setup. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands by sending specially crafted query strings to the PHP CGI interpreter. The flaw is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code or retrieve the source code of web applications. The vulnerability arises due to the PHP CGI's failure to properly process URIs that lack an '=' character, enabling attackers to pass additional arguments to the php-cgi binary. This can be leveraged to execute code by manipulating PHP configuration options or to display source code using specific command-line options. The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, and it can lead to unauthorized access and execution of malicious code on affected systems. The issue is exacerbated by certain configurations, such as default XAMPP installations, which are vulnerable by default, and it can be further exploited by encoding techniques that bypass initial patches, particularly on Windows systems with specific regional settings.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.3.0', '5.3.1', '5.3.2', '5.3.3', '5.3.4', '5.3.5', '5.3.6', '5.3.7', '5.3.8', '5.3.9', '5.3.10', '5.3.11', '5.4.0', '5.4.1']] PHP is the core service that contains the vulnerability, specifically in its CGI implementation.
- [SOFT-WEB][httpd][['2.2']] Apache HTTP Server is used to serve web content and is commonly used with PHP in a CGI configuration, which is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
