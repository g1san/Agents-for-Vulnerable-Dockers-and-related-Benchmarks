    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical vulnerability in PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.2 when configured as a CGI script. The flaw in `sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c` allows remote attackers to inject command-line options into PHP execution, enabling arbitrary code execution. This occurs due to improper handling of query strings without an equals sign (`=`), allowing attackers to manipulate query strings to pass unauthorized command-line arguments to the PHP interpreter. The root cause is linked to the `php_getopt` function, which fails to skip certain cases, notably the 'd' case used for defining PHP runtime configuration directives.",
