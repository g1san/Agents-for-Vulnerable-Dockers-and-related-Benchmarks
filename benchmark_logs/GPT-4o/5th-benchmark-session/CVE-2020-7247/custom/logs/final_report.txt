CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability found in OpenSMTPD, a widely-used mail server, which allows for remote code execution and local privilege escalation. The vulnerability arises from improper handling and inadequate escaping of dangerous characters in user-controlled input, specifically within the smtp_mailaddr function in smtp_session.c. This flaw permits remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by sending a specially-crafted SMTP session that exploits shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field. This vulnerability affects OpenSMTPD versions after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2, including OpenBSD versions 6.6, 6.5, 6.4, and 5.9. The issue is present in the default configuration and can be exploited by unauthenticated, remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability was disclosed on January 28, 2020, and patches were made available on January 29, 2020. Exploits for this vulnerability are publicly available, making it easier for attackers to exploit the flaw. Users are advised to update to OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2 or later to mitigate the risk.
