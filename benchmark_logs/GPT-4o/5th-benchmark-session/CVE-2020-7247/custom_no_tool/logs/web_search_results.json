    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, a mail transfer agent used in various Unix-like operating systems, including OpenBSD. The vulnerability exists in OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2 and earlier versions, specifically after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2. The issue arises from the improper handling of input validation, where dangerous shell metacharacters are not properly escaped in user-controlled input. This flaw is exploited through a crafted SMTP session, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system. The attack vector involves inserting shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field of an SMTP session. The vulnerability is present in the default, \"uncommented\" configuration of OpenSMTPD. It has been addressed in later versions, and patches have been applied in several distributions. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands as root, posing a significant security risk.",
