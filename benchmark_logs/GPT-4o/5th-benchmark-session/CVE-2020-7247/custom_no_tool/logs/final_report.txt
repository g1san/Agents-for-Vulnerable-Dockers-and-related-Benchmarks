----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, a mail transfer agent used in various Unix-like operating systems, including OpenBSD. The vulnerability exists in OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2 and earlier versions, specifically after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2. The issue arises from the improper handling of input validation, where dangerous shell metacharacters are not properly escaped in user-controlled input. This flaw is exploited through a crafted SMTP session, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system. The attack vector involves inserting shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field of an SMTP session. The vulnerability is present in the default, "uncommented" configuration of OpenSMTPD. It has been addressed in later versions, and patches have been applied in several distributions. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands as root, posing a significant security risk.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the Dockerfile is attempting to pull an image 'openbsd:6.6' from Docker Hub, which does not exist. The OpenBSD image is not available on Docker Hub, resulting in a 'pull access denied' error.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to use a base image that is available on Docker Hub. Since OpenSMTPD is commonly deployed on OpenBSD, and there is no official OpenBSD image, we can switch to a different base image such as Alpine Linux, which is lightweight and suitable for running OpenSMTPD. We'll install OpenSMTPD from source or from available packages on Alpine Linux.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate configuration issues with the SMTP server inside the container. Specifically, it mentions missing 'aliases' and 'local_mail' configurations in the smtpd.conf file. This suggests that the SMTP service is not correctly configured, leading to the container potentially not functioning as intended.
	- ERROR: The configuration issues are due to missing 'aliases' and 'local_mail' configurations in the smtpd.conf file, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the SMTP server. Without these configurations, the SMTP service cannot handle local mail delivery properly, leading to potential failures in the container's operation.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we will update the smtpd.conf file to include the 'aliases' and 'local_mail' configurations. We will define a local delivery action and ensure that it is properly referenced in the match rules. Additionally, we will ensure that the necessary directories and files for aliases and mailboxes are available within the container.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate several issues with the configuration file '/etc/smtpd/smtpd.conf'. Specifically, there are errors related to undefined tables and dispatchers, as well as a syntax error. Additionally, there is a warning about the absence of rules, suggesting that the service is not properly configured and likely not functioning as intended.
	- ERROR: The configuration file '/etc/smtpd/smtpd.conf' has errors related to undefined tables and dispatchers, as well as a syntax error. Additionally, there is a warning about the absence of rules, indicating that the service is not configured correctly and is likely not functioning as intended.
	- FIX: To resolve the issues, the smtpd.conf file needs to be corrected to include valid table and dispatcher definitions. Additionally, the Dockerfile should ensure that all necessary directories and files are created and properly configured. The OpenSMTPD service configuration should include rules that properly define local and remote mail handling.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate a syntax error in the SMTP configuration file at line 18. This error prevents the SMTP service from starting correctly, causing the container to malfunction.
	- ERROR: The logs indicate a syntax error in the SMTP configuration file at line 18. This error prevents the SMTP service from starting correctly, causing the container to malfunction. The error is likely due to incorrect syntax in the match rule or the alias configuration.
	- FIX: The fix involves correcting the syntax error in the smtpd.conf file. Specifically, the match rule should be corrected to properly define the action. Additionally, ensure that the alias table is correctly defined and referenced. This involves ensuring that the match rule uses 'for domain' correctly and that any alias configurations are properly formatted.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate there is a syntax error in the configuration file '/etc/smtpd/smtpd.conf' at line 18. This error prevents the SMTP service from starting correctly within the container.
	- ERROR: The syntax error in the configuration file '/etc/smtpd/smtpd.conf' at line 18 is due to the incorrect use of match rules and action definitions. The configuration needs to properly define the action and ensure that the match rules are correctly formatted and implemented.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to correct the syntax in the smtpd.conf file by ensuring that the match rule is properly defined with the correct use of domain and action. Additionally, ensure that the alias table and local mail delivery action are correctly referenced and configured. The match rule should use 'for any' instead of 'for domain' to handle all incoming mail correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The log indicates a syntax error in the '/etc/smtpd/smtpd.conf' file at line 18. This suggests that the SMTP daemon configuration is incorrect, preventing the container from starting or functioning properly.
	- ERROR: The error in the '/etc/smtpd/smtpd.conf' file at line 18 is due to incorrect syntax in the match rule. The rule needs to properly define the action for handling mail. The existing configuration does not correctly specify the action, leading to a syntax error.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, the syntax of the match rule in the smtpd.conf file is corrected by explicitly stating the action for mail handling. The rule is updated to match emails from any source to any destination and apply the 'local_mail' action. This ensures that the configuration is valid and the OpenSMTPD service can start without syntax errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The logs indicate there is a syntax error in the SMTPD configuration file at line 18. This error is preventing the service within the container from starting or operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The syntax error in the smtpd.conf file at line 18 is due to the incorrect definition of the match rule. The rule is not properly specifying the action or the conditions for matching mail, leading to a failure in the configuration parsing.
	- FIX: To fix the syntax error, we need to explicitly define the match rule with the correct syntax. Specifically, we should ensure that the match rule specifies both the source and destination conditions and the action to be taken. By correcting the match rule to properly define the action for handling mail, the configuration will be valid, and OpenSMTPD will be able to start without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: The error message indicates a syntax error in the SMTPD configuration file at line 18. This suggests that the container is not running correctly due to a misconfiguration in the SMTP service setup.
	- ERROR: The error is due to a syntax issue in the smtpd.conf file on line 18, where the match rule is not correctly defined. This prevents the OpenSMTPD service from starting properly within the Docker container, causing the entire setup to fail when using docker-compose.
	- FIX: To fix the error, the smtpd.conf file needs to be corrected. Specifically, the match rule should be properly defined to ensure that local mail delivery is correctly handled. This involves ensuring the syntax of the match rule is compliant with OpenSMTPD's expected format. Additionally, we need to ensure that the Dockerfile is set up to correctly run the OpenSMTPD service with the fixed configuration.
