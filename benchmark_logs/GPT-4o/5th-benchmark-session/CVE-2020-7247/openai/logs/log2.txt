#7 7.658 ---------------------
#7 7.658 
#7 7.658 The "mail name" is used as the domain name in the email address for messages
#7 7.658 that only have a "local part" (such as <jrandomuser> or <root>). It should be a
#7 7.658 fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you are entitled to use.
#7 7.658 
#7 7.658 For instance, to allow the local host to generate mail with addresses such as
#7 7.658 <jrandomuser@example.org>, set the system mail name to "example.org".
#7 7.658 
#7 7.658 This mail name is used as the hostname in the SMTP greeting banner, and will
#7 7.658 also be used by other programs.
#7 7.658 
#7 7.658 System mail name: 
#7 7.658 Use of uninitialized value $_[1] in join or string at /usr/share/perl5/Debconf/DbDriver/Stack.pm line 111.
#7 7.659 Mail for the "postmaster", "root", and other system accounts should be
#7 7.659 redirected to the user account(s) of the actual system administrator(s).
#7 7.659 
#7 7.659 Please enter a comma-separated list of the usernames of the intended
#7 7.659 recipients. Leave this field blank to not create an alias for "root"; in this
#7 7.659 case, the root account will receive mail addressed to "postmaster" and other
#7 7.659 system accounts, assuming aliases for these accounts do not already exist.
