      "description": "### Summary\n\nIn the fallback extraction path for source distributions, `pip` used Pythonâ€™s `tarfile` module without verifying that symbolic/hard link targets resolve inside the intended extraction directory. A malicious sdist can include links that escape the target directory and overwrite arbitrary files on the invoking host during `pip install`.\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation enables arbitrary file overwrite outside the build/extraction directory on the machine running `pip`. This can be leveraged to tamper with configuration or startup files and may lead to further code execution depending on the environment, but the direct, guaranteed impact is integrity compromise on the vulnerable system.\n\n### Conditions\n\nThe issue is triggered when installing an attacker-controlled sdist (e.g., from an index or URL) and the fallback extraction code path is used. No special privileges are required beyond running `pip install`; active user action is necessary.\n\n### Remediation\n\nThe [fix](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13550), while available as a patch that can be manually applied, has not yet been put into a numbered version but is planned for `25.3`. Using a Python interpreter that implements the safe-extraction behavior described by **PEP 706** provides additional defense in depth for other `tarfile` issues but is not a substitute for upgrading pip for this specific flaw.",

      "description": "### Summary \nA path traversal vulnerability in `PackageIndex` was fixed in setuptools version 78.1.1\n\n### Details\n```\n    def _download_url(self, url, tmpdir):\n        # Determine download filename\n        #\n        name, _fragment = egg_info_for_url(url)\n        if name:\n            while '..' in name:\n                name = name.replace('..', '.').replace('\\\\', '_')\n        else:\n            name = \"__downloaded__\"  # default if URL has no path contents\n\n        if name.endswith('.[egg.zip](http://egg.zip/)'):\n            name = name[:-4]  # strip the extra .zip before download\n\n -->       filename = os.path.join(tmpdir, name)\n```\n\nHere: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/6ead555c5fb29bc57fe6105b1bffc163f56fd558/setuptools/package_index.py#L810C1-L825C88\n\n`os.path.join()` discards the first argument `tmpdir` if the second begins with a slash or drive letter.\n`name` is derived from a URL without sufficient sanitization. While there is some attempt to sanitize by replacing instances of '..' with '.', it is insufficient.\n\n### Risk Assessment\nAs easy_install and package_index are deprecated, the exploitation surface is reduced.\nHowever, it seems this could be exploited in a similar fashion like https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9hx-vwmv-q579, and as described by POC 4 in https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5 report: via malicious URLs present on the pages of a package index.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker would be allowed to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem with the permissions of the process running the Python code, which could escalate to RCE depending on the context.\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.com/bounties/d6362117-ad57-4e83-951f-b8141c6e7ca5\nhttps://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4946",
