CVE description: CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability affecting Jenkins, a widely used open-source automation server. The vulnerability is an arbitrary file read flaw that arises from the args4j library used by Jenkins for processing command-line interface (CLI) commands. Specifically, the feature 'expandAtFiles' is responsible for this vulnerability. It allows the replacement of an '@' character followed by a file path with the file's contents. This feature is enabled by default in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, and LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. As a result, attackers can exploit this flaw to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system. The severity of this vulnerability is high, with a CVSS score of 7.5, and in some assessments, it is rated even higher due to its potential impact. Attackers with Overall/Read permission can read entire files, while those without this permission can read only the first few lines, depending on the CLI commands available. The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution if attackers manage to read sensitive files like cryptographic keys. Mitigation involves updating Jenkins to versions 2.442, LTS 2.426.3, or later, which disable this command parser feature. Alternatively, disabling CLI access can serve as a temporary workaround for those unable to update immediately.
Attack Type: Arbitrary File Read
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jenkins/jenkins][['2.441', 'LTS 2.426.2']] Jenkins is the primary service affected by CVE-2024-23897, as the vulnerability exists within its CLI command parser, allowing arbitrary file reads.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['11-jre-slim']] Jenkins requires Java to run, and OpenJDK provides the necessary Java runtime environment for Jenkins.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21.3']] Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy to manage traffic to the Jenkins service.
