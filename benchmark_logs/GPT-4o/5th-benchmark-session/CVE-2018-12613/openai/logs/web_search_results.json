    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a security vulnerability identified in phpMyAdmin, a widely used web-based database management tool for MySQL and MariaDB. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a local file inclusion attack, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server. In phpMyAdmin versions prior to 4.8.2, there exists a flaw in the way the software handles certain parameters, specifically the `cfg` array. An attacker can manipulate this array to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is achieved by crafting a malicious request that exploits the improper validation of user-supplied input, leading to the inclusion and execution of unintended files. Such an attack can result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, execution of arbitrary code, or other malicious activities, depending on the contents of the included files.",
