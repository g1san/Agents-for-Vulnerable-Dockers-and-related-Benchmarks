    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability affecting phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw that allows an attacker to include, view, and potentially execute files on the server. The vulnerability is due to inadequate input validation, specifically in the handling of directory traversal in the index.php file. Exploitation involves manipulating URLs to access session files, which can be used to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution if an attacker can execute a SELECT SQL query containing PHP code. Additionally, if the configuration setting \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']\" is set to true, an attacker can specify any host they control and execute arbitrary code without authentication. This vulnerability highlights the importance of maintaining updated software versions to prevent unauthorized access.",
