CVE description: CVE-2018-12613 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability arises due to improper validation of user input, specifically in the handling of directory traversal attacks. Through the use of a double-encoded character sequence, an attacker can bypass validation filters and access local files on the server. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to sensitive files and can lead to remote code execution if an attacker can include and execute PHP code by manipulating session files stored on the server. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have access to the phpMyAdmin URL endpoint, an authenticated user's session cookies, and knowledge of the file path they wish to access. This can potentially compromise the server by allowing the execution of arbitrary PHP code, leading to unauthorized access and control over the system.
Attack Type: Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] phpMyAdmin is the main service vulnerable to CVE-2018-12613. Versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 have a local file inclusion vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution.
- [SOFT-WEB][php][['7.2-apache']] PHP is required to run phpMyAdmin, which is a PHP-based web application. The Apache version of PHP is used to serve phpMyAdmin over the web.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is a database service needed for phpMyAdmin to manage and interact with databases.
