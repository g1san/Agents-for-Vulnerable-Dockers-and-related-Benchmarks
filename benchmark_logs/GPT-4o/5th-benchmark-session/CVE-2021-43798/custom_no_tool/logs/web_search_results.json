{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a critical path traversal vulnerability in Grafana, an open-source analytics and visualization platform, affecting versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting a flaw in the public API endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId`. The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-provided file paths, allowing attackers to manipulate the file path to traverse directories and access sensitive files. This can lead to the exfiltration of the Grafana SQLite database, enabling attackers to extract user information, configuration files, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability is easily exploitable using crafted HTTP requests and can be tested with tools like curl or scripts. Grafana Cloud instances were not affected. Patched versions include 8.3.1, 8.2.7, 8.1.8, and 8.0.7.",
