    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a high-severity path traversal vulnerability in Grafana, a data visualization and monitoring web application. This vulnerability affects Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0 (excluding patched releases) and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the server through a crafted HTTP request. The vulnerability is present in the `/public/plugins/:pluginId` API endpoint, which does not properly validate user input, enabling attackers to traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information such as password hashes from the Grafana SQLite database. Attackers can potentially brute-force these hashes to gain administrative access, allowing them to write files to the filesystem via plugins. However, the potential for code execution is limited. The vulnerability was disclosed as a zero-day on December 3, 2021, and Grafana released a patch on December 7, 2021. Despite this, many instances remain vulnerable due to delayed patching.",
