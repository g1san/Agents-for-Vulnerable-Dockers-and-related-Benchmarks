    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a security vulnerability found in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37 through 9.4.42, 10.0.1 through 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 through 11.0.5. This flaw allows attackers to craft URIs using specific encoded characters to access the contents of the WEB-INF directory and/or bypass certain security constraints. The WEB-INF directory typically contains sensitive configuration files and resources that are intended to be inaccessible to external users. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can retrieve files such as `web.xml`, which may disclose information about the application's structure and security configurations. This issue is a variation of a previously reported vulnerability, CVE-2021-28164. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of encoded characters in URIs, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information within the WEB-INF directory.",
