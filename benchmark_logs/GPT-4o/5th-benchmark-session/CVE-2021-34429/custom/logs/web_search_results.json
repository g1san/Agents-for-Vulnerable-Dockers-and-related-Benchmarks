    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5 of the org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp package. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a path traversal attack by crafting URIs with encoded characters to access the protected WEB-INF directory. By using encoded dot segments, such as %u002e, an attacker can bypass security constraints and potentially access sensitive files like WEB-INF/web.xml. This vulnerability arises from changes in URI parsing to comply with RFC standards, which inadvertently allowed protected resources to be accessed via aliasing. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating a moderate severity level. It can be exploited over a network with low attack complexity and requires no privileges or user interaction, impacting the confidentiality of the system.",
