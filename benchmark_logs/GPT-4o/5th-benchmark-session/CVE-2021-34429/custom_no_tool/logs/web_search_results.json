{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting versions 9.4.37 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. This vulnerability allows for sensitive file disclosure through path traversal. The issue arises from the ability to craft URIs with encoded characters, such as `%u002e`, to access the WEB-INF directory, which contains sensitive configuration files like `web.xml`. This bypasses security constraints and exposes sensitive information about web application implementations. The vulnerability is considered moderate, with a CVSS score of 5.3, and was patched in later versions by ensuring URIs are decoded before normalization, preventing further normalization attacks.",
