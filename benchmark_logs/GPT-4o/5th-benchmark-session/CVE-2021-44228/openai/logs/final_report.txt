CVE description: CVE-2021-44228, also known as "Log4Shell," is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a popular Java-based logging utility. The flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on servers by exploiting how Log4j handles log messages. Specifically, when a log message contains a specially crafted string, Log4j can trigger a lookup that fetches and executes code from a remote server using protocols like LDAP. This behavior enables unauthorized remote code execution, potentially giving attackers full control over affected systems. The vulnerability impacts Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1, and has been rated with the highest severity score of 10.0 on the CVSS scale due to its ease of exploitation and widespread impact.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][openjdk][['8u312-jdk']] The OpenJDK Docker image provides the Java Development Kit (JDK) necessary to run Java applications. Log4j 2 is a Java-based library, so a Java runtime environment is essential.
- [HARD][maven][['3.8.4-openjdk-8']] Apache Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It manages project dependencies, including Log4j 2, and is necessary for building and managing the Java application that will utilize the vulnerable Log4j 2 versions.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21.3']] Nginx is a web server that can serve as a reverse proxy to forward HTTP requests to the Java application. While not directly related to the vulnerability, it facilitates the deployment and accessibility of the Java application within the Docker environment.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
