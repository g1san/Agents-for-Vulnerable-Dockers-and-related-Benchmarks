{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a popular Java-based logging utility. The flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on servers by exploiting how Log4j handles log messages. Specifically, when a log message contains a specially crafted string, Log4j can trigger a lookup that fetches and executes code from a remote server using protocols like LDAP. This behavior enables unauthorized remote code execution, potentially giving attackers full control over affected systems. The vulnerability impacts Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1, and has been rated with the highest severity score of 10.0 on the CVSS scale due to its ease of exploitation and widespread impact.",
