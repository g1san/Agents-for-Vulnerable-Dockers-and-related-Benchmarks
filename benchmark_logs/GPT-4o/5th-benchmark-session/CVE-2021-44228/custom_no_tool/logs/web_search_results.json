    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, commonly referred to as 'Log4Shell,' is a critical vulnerability found in the Apache Log4j 2 library, which is a widely used Java-based logging utility. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution by exploiting improper input validation. Attackers can execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious input that gets logged by Log4j. The flaw is particularly severe because it affects a wide range of applications and services that use Log4j for logging, including enterprise applications and cloud services. The vulnerability is easily exploitable via specially crafted requests that can instruct vulnerable systems to download and execute malicious payloads. The issue lies in Log4j's handling of user input with special characters, which can trigger the execution of remote Java classes via the JNDI lookup feature. Vulnerable versions include Log4j 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0 (excluding 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), and organizations are urged to update to version 2.17.1 or apply mitigations to protect against this and related vulnerabilities.",
