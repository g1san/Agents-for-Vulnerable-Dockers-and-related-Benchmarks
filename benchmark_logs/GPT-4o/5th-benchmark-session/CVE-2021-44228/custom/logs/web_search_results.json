    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as Log4Shell, is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used Java-based logging framework. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a server by submitting a specially crafted request that exploits the library's JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) features. The flaw is triggered when Log4j processes log messages containing certain strings, leading to remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability affects Log4j 2.x versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0-rc1, excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. It is critical for systems using affected versions of Log4j 2 to update to a patched version, such as 2.17.1, to mitigate the risk. This vulnerability is particularly severe due to the widespread use of Log4j and the availability of exploit code online, making numerous systems potentially exploitable. Exploitation of CVE-2021-44228 has been linked to various malicious activities, including information stealing, coin mining, and deploying backdoors like CobaltStrike.",
