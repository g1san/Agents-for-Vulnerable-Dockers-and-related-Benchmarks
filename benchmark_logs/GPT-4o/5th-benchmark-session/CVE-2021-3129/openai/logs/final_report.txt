CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a critical security vulnerability identified in the Ignition package, a debugging and error-handling tool used in Laravel and other PHP applications. This flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The issue arises from insecure usage of PHP functions `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()` within Ignition versions prior to 2.5.2. These functions, when improperly handled, can be exploited by attackers to perform unauthorized file operations. The vulnerability is particularly exploitable on sites running Laravel versions before 8.4.2 with debug mode enabled.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['7.4']] PHP is essential for running Laravel applications.
- [HARD][composer][['1.10']] Composer is required for managing PHP dependencies, including Laravel and Ignition.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL serves as the database backend for Laravel applications.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.18']] Nginx acts as the web server to handle HTTP requests.
