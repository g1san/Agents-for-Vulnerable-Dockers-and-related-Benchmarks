{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical vulnerability found in the Laravel framework, specifically within the Laravel Ignition package, which is used for debugging purposes. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution when the debug mode is enabled. The issue arises from the misuse of PHP functions like `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()` within the Ignition module, particularly in the `MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution` class. This misuse leads to improper validation and sanitization of user-controlled input, such as environment variables. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious PHAR files that are deserialized by the vulnerable application, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability affects Laravel versions up to 8.4.2 and Ignition versions before 2.5.2. Exploitation does not require authentication and can be executed by accessing application logs, typically stored in the `storage/logs` directory. The severity of this vulnerability is underscored by its CVSSv3 score of 9.8, indicating a high risk of unauthorized remote code execution, data theft, data modification, malware installation, and unauthorized access. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to disable debug mode in production environments, update Laravel to a version later than 8.4.2, and update Ignition to version 2.5.2 or later.",
