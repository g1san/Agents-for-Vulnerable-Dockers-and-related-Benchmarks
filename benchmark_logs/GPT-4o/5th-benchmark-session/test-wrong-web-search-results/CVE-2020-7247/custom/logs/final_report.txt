Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.0-r0) is not available in the Alpine Linux package repository for version 3.11. The package manager is unable to find and install this specific version, causing the build to fail.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we need to update the Dockerfile to install the latest available version of OpenSMTPD that is compatible with Alpine 3.11. This involves removing the specific version constraint in the 'apk add' command, allowing the package manager to install the latest available version of OpenSMTPD for Alpine 3.11.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: The error logs indicate that the OpenSMTPD configuration file is trying to reference a table named 'aliases' and a dispatcher 'local' that do not exist or are not properly configured. Additionally, the warning 'no rules, nothing to do' suggests that the configuration file lacks valid rules for processing mail.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to adjust the smtpd.conf file to use a valid configuration. We can remove the references to the 'aliases' table and the 'local' dispatcher, and instead use a default action and match rule that OpenSMTPD can recognize without additional setup. We'll also ensure that the Dockerfile installs a specific version of OpenSMTPD known to be vulnerable, aligning with the CVE description.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the specified version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.0) is not available in the Alpine Linux package repository for version 3.11. The package manager is unable to find this specific version, leading to a failure in the build process.
	- FIX: To resolve this issue, we need to use the available version of OpenSMTPD in the Alpine repository that matches the vulnerable version range. According to the CVE description, OpenSMTPD versions after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2 are vulnerable, which includes version 6.6.1. Therefore, we should adjust the Dockerfile to install OpenSMTPD version 6.6.1, which is likely available in the Alpine repository and matches the version range specified in the CVE description.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error is due to the specific version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.1) not being available in the Alpine 3.11 repository. The package manager cannot find the exact version specified, leading to a failure in the build process.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install the latest available version of OpenSMTPD from the Alpine 3.11 repository without specifying a version. This will allow the package manager to select the most appropriate version available, which should be compatible with the system. Additionally, we need to ensure that the Docker Compose file is updated to remove the obsolete 'version' attribute, as it is no longer needed and may cause confusion.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile uses 'alpine:3.11' which includes 'opensmtpd' version 6.6.4p1-r1, rather than just '6.6'. Therefore, the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not achieved.
	- ERROR: The current Docker setup uses 'alpine:3.11', which includes 'opensmtpd' version 6.6.4p1-r1. This version is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-7247 as it is beyond the specified vulnerable range. The goal is to use 'opensmtpd' version '6.6', which is vulnerable.
	- FIX: To achieve the use of a vulnerable 'opensmtpd' version, we need to switch from using the package manager to manually downloading and installing the specific version '6.6'. This involves retrieving the source code for 'opensmtpd' version '6.6', building it, and installing it in the Alpine container. This ensures that the version matches the vulnerable criteria specified in the CVE.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the wget command is attempting to download a version of OpenSMTPD that is no longer available at the specified URL, resulting in a 404 Not Found error.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to find an alternative source for the OpenSMTPD version 6.6.0p1, or use a different version that is still available for download. In this case, we will use the OpenSMTPD version 6.6.1, which falls within the vulnerable range specified by the CVE. We will update the Dockerfile to download this version from a different URL where it is still available.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error occurs because the specified URL for downloading OpenSMTPD version 6.6.1 returns a 404 Not Found error, indicating that the file is no longer available at that location.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to use a different method for obtaining the vulnerable version of OpenSMTPD. Instead of downloading the source from a URL that no longer hosts the file, we can switch to using a package manager that still provides the vulnerable version.

Since the CVE description mentions that OpenSMTPD versions after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2 are vulnerable, we can use the package manager to install a version that falls within this range. In this case, we'll use Alpine's package manager to install OpenSMTPD version 6.6, which is the closest available version in the Alpine repositories that matches the CVE criteria.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the package manager cannot find the specific version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.0-r0) requested in the Dockerfile. The error 'unable to select packages' and 'breaks: world[opensmtpd=6.6.0-r0]' suggest that this version is not available in the Alpine Linux package repository for the specified version of Alpine (3.11).
	- FIX: To fix this, we will build OpenSMTPD from source, ensuring that we use a version that matches the vulnerable range specified in the CVE (after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2). We will download the source code for version 6.6.1, which falls within the vulnerable range, and compile it in the Dockerfile. This approach ensures that we have the correct version for testing the vulnerability.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The error in the logs indicates that the tar command encountered an 'invalid magic' error, which typically means that the file being extracted is not a valid tar archive. This is likely because the curl command did not download the expected tar.gz file, possibly due to a broken or incorrect URL.
	- FIX: To fix this, we will manually download the OpenSMTPD source code from a reliable source and use a specific commit that falls within the vulnerable range specified by the CVE. We'll then build it from source within the Dockerfile. Additionally, we'll ensure that the Dockerfile uses a known vulnerable version of OpenSMTPD by checking out the specific commit a8e222352f, which is vulnerable according to the CVE description. We'll also update the Dockerfile to include any necessary dependencies and configurations for a successful build.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
