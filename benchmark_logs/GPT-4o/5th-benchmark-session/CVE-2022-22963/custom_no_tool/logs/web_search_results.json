    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Function framework, specifically affecting versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of routing expressions, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions via the HTTP request header parameter `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression`. This flaw can lead to remote code execution, enabling unauthorized access to local resources and potentially compromising the entire host or container. The vulnerability is particularly concerning in cloud environments, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, where serverless functions are used. Exploitation is straightforward and can be achieved with a simple HTTP request. To mitigate the risk, it is recommended to upgrade to Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3 and implement runtime detection tools to monitor for exploitation attempts.",
