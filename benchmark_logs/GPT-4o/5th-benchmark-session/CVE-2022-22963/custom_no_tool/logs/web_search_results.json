    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Function framework, specifically affecting versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to improper handling of input data when using routing functionality. An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a function endpoint, injecting Spring Expression Language (SpEL) via an HTTP request header. This can lead to unauthorized access to local resources and potentially compromise the entire system. The vulnerability is particularly concerning due to its ease of exploitation and high impact, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host server. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to upgrade to versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3, use image scanning during build and deployment processes, and employ runtime detection tools to identify malicious activities.",
