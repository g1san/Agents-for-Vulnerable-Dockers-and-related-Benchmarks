    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability found in the Spring Cloud Function framework, specifically in versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. The vulnerability is associated with the routing functionality of the framework, where an attacker can exploit the HTTP request header parameter `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` by injecting a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. This expression can be executed through `StandardEvaluationContext`, potentially allowing remote code execution and access to local resources. The vulnerability poses a significant risk as it can lead to complete host or container compromise, impacting cloud serverless functions such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. To mitigate this issue, users are advised to upgrade to Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3. The vulnerability was discovered and reported by m09u3r, and its exploitation can result in a critical impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of affected systems.",
