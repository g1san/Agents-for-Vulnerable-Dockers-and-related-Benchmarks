    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is a vulnerability affecting Joomla! versions 4.0.0 to 4.2.7, due to improper access checks that allow an authentication bypass. This flaw can lead to information disclosure, enabling attackers to access sensitive data such as MySQL database credentials through endpoints like `/api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true`. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to obtain Joomla-related configuration information, potentially leading to further exploitation, including changing Super User passwords and executing code via modified templates or plugins. The vulnerability has drawn significant attention due to its potential for code execution, despite being rated medium severity. It primarily affects systems with exposed MySQL installations, as many Joomla! setups bind MySQL to localhost, limiting the impact. Users are advised to update to Joomla version 4.2.8 or later to mitigate this risk.",
