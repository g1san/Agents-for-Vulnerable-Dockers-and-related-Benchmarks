    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Joomla! versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7, which allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to improper access checks that permit unauthorized access to web service endpoints, leading to information disclosure. Exploits focus on leaking MySQL database credentials, which can be used to alter the Joomla! Super User's password, enabling administrative access to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is critical because it can be exploited to extract sensitive information without authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access and code execution. The vulnerability was patched in Joomla version 4.2.8.",
