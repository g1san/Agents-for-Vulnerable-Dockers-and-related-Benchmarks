CVE description: CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt software, specifically affecting the Salt Master service. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to connect to the 'request server' port, bypass authentication, and execute arbitrary commands on the Salt Master and connected minions. The flaw is due to improper authentication checks in the ClearFuncs class, which is exposed to external connections. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the Salt Master, potentially compromising the entire infrastructure managed by Salt. The vulnerability affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. It is crucial to patch or apply mitigations to protect the Salt Master from exploitation.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] SaltStack Salt is the main service that is vulnerable to CVE-2020-11651. The Salt Master service is where the vulnerability resides, allowing unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands.
- [SOFT][python][['3.8']] Python is required to run SaltStack Salt and exploit scripts, as the PoC and Salt itself are Python-based.
- [SOFT][zeromq][['4.3.2']] ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library needed by SaltStack for communication between master and minions.
