    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical security vulnerability identified in SaltStack's Salt software, affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, which fails to properly validate method calls. This oversight allows remote attackers to invoke certain methods without authentication, enabling them to retrieve user tokens from the `salt-master` and execute arbitrary commands on connected `salt-minion` instances.",
