    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management and orchestration tool. The vulnerability exists in the ClearFuncs class of the Salt master process, which fails to properly authenticate method calls from unauthenticated clients. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass authentication and authorization checks, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt master server and any connected minions. Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access, control over the Salt master and minions, retrieval of sensitive information such as user tokens, and even full system compromise. The vulnerability affects SaltStack Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000.2, and it underscores the importance of keeping systems updated with the latest security patches to mitigate such critical risks.",
