CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a security vulnerability identified in SaltStack's Salt software, affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, which exposes certain methods that inadequately sanitize file paths. This flaw permits authenticated users to access arbitrary directories on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure or modification.
Attack Type: Unauthorized access to arbitrary directories on the server by authenticated users due to improper path sanitization in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][salt-master][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The `salt-master` service is the primary component affected by CVE-2020-11652 due to improper path sanitization in the `ClearFuncs` class.
- [SOFT][salt-minion][['Compatible with the `salt-master` version in use']] The `salt-minion` service is required to establish a functional SaltStack environment but does not directly contribute to the vulnerability.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
