    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a security vulnerability identified in SaltStack's Salt software, affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, which exposes certain methods that inadequately sanitize file paths. This flaw permits authenticated users to access arbitrary directories on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure or modification.",
