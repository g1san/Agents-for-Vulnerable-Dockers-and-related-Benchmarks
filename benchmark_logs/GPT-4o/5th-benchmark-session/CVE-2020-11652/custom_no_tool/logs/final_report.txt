CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a directory traversal vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management tool used for IT automation. This vulnerability affects the Salt master server, allowing unauthorized access to the file system. The flaw is due to insufficient path sanitization in the salt-master process's ClearFuncs class, which permits attackers to read files outside intended directories. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized command execution, and full control over the Salt master and its minions. The vulnerability is critical as it can be exploited remotely without authentication, posing significant security risks. Affected versions include Salt 2019.2.3 and earlier, and Salt 3000.1 and earlier. SaltStack has released patches in versions 2019.2.4 and 3000.2 to address this issue by sanitizing paths and limiting method exposure.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.3', '3000.1']] SaltStack Salt is the primary service affected by CVE-2020-11652. It is a configuration management tool that, when vulnerable, allows unauthorized access to the Salt master server's file system.
- [SOFT][python][['3.8']] Python is required to run scripts that exploit the vulnerability in SaltStack Salt.
- [SOFT][zeromq][['4.3.2']] ZeroMQ is used as the transport layer in SaltStack Salt, and is necessary for the Salt master and minions to communicate.
