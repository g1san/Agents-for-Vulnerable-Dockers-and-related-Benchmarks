CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability affecting SaltStack, a configuration management tool. It allows unauthorized access to the file system of the SaltStack master server. By exploiting this flaw, attackers can perform directory traversal attacks to read any file on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous when combined with CVE-2020-11651, which allows remote command execution, as together they enable attackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive files on the SaltStack master server. The vulnerability affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. It is associated with the salt-master process, specifically within the ClearFuncs class, which fails to properly sanitize paths in certain methods, permitting authenticated users to access arbitrary directories. The vulnerability can be exploited through the Salt API, which allows attackers to perform arbitrary file reads and writes on the server and all connected minions. The default Salt installation often runs as root, exacerbating the potential impact by allowing attackers to write cron jobs for code execution.
Attack Type: Unauthorized Access and Arbitrary File Read/Write
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.3', '3000.1']] SaltStack Salt is the configuration management tool that contains the vulnerability. Versions 2019.2.3 and 3000.1 are vulnerable to CVE-2020-11652.
- [SOFT][python][['3.7']] Python is required to run SaltStack and any scripts or tools needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- [SOFT][docker][['20.10.7']] Docker is used to containerize the SaltStack setup, allowing for easy deployment and testing of the vulnerable system.
