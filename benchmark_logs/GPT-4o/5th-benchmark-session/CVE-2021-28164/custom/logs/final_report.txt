CVE description: CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability present in Eclipse Jetty, a widely used web server and servlet container. The issue stems from improper input validation in the default compliance mode, which allows remote attackers to exploit the vulnerability by sending specially-crafted requests containing %2e or %2e%2e segments. This can lead to unauthorized access to protected resources within the WEB-INF directory, potentially exposing sensitive information and enabling further attacks on the affected system. The vulnerability is exploitable via the HTTP protocol without requiring authentication, making it a significant risk for information disclosure. The affected versions of Eclipse Jetty are 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.3, indicating a moderate severity level.
