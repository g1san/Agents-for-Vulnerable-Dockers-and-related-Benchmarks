    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting versions 9.4.37 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. The issue arises from improper handling of URIs with encoded characters, allowing unauthorized access to the protected WEB-INF directory by bypassing security constraints. This vulnerability is due to the default compliance mode, which permits URIs containing a %u002e segment to access sensitive resources like the web.xml file. Additionally, the use of an encoded null character can prevent proper normalization, further compromising security. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve any file within the WEB-INF folder, with the \"web.xml\" file being particularly valuable as it may contain sensitive information. The vulnerability is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.3, as it allows unauthorized access to sensitive information without requiring privileges or user interaction. It is remotely exploitable without authentication, meaning it can be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.",
