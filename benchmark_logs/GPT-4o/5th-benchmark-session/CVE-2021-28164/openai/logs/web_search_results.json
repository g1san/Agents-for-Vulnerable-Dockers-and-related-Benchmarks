    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a security vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 and 9.4.38.v20210224, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information via a directory traversal attack. Attackers can exploit this flaw by crafting specific HTTP requests to retrieve protected files, such as the `web.xml` configuration file, due to Jetty's improper handling of URL-encoded paths. This enables attackers to bypass security constraints and access restricted resources.",
