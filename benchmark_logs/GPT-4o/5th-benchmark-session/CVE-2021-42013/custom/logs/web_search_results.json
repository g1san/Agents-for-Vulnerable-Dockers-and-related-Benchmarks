    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability that affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability arises from an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-41773, allowing attackers to perform path traversal attacks by accessing files outside the designated directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" unauthorized requests can succeed. Furthermore, if CGI scripts are enabled on these paths, it could lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability highlights the need for proper configuration and timely updates to mitigate such risks. The issue was fixed in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.51.",
