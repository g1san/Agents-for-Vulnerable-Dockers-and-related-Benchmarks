    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical security vulnerability identified in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This flaw allows an attacker to perform path traversal attacks, enabling them to access files outside the intended document root. If these files are not protected by the default configuration directive \"require all denied,\" unauthorized access can occur. Furthermore, if Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are enabled for these aliased paths, the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This issue was found to be an incomplete fix for the previous vulnerability, CVE-2021-41773.",
