    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability arises due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773. It allows attackers to perform a path traversal attack, enabling them to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the default configuration 'require all denied,' the requests can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled, this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability is exploitable when mod_cgi is enabled and requires specific configurations that allow the execution of scripts outside the document root. This issue was resolved in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.51.",
