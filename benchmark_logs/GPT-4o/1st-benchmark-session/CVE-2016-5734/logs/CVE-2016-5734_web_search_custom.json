    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The issue arises from improper delimiter selection, which fails to prevent the use of the preg_replace 'e' (eval) modifier. This flaw could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code through a crafted string, as demonstrated by the table search-and-replace implementation. This vulnerability highlights a critical security risk where attackers can potentially execute malicious code on the server, compromising the integrity and security of the system.",
