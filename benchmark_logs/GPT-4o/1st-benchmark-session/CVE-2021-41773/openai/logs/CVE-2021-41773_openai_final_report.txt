Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: The container is not running as indicated by 'State': {'Status': 'exited', 'Running': False}. The 'ExitCode' is 1, which suggests an error occurred during execution.

2. Services Ok: The logs only show the use of 'httpd' service. There is no mention of 'alpine', so the services provided do not match the required list.

3. Code Main Version: The 'HTTPD_VERSION' is '2.4.49', which is exactly the required version, so this goal is achieved.
	Error: The Docker container is not running because the 'httpd' service is not correctly configured to use the 'alpine' base image, which is a requirement. Additionally, the Docker setup does not match the required services list, as 'alpine' is not used.
	Fix: To fix the error, update the Dockerfile to use an 'alpine' based image for httpd, specifically 'httpd:2.4.49-alpine'. This aligns with the requirement to use 'alpine' as a base image. Also, ensure the Docker Compose file specifies the correct build context and the Dockerfile is compatible with Alpine Linux.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly as the 'Status' is 'exited' and 'Running' is 'False'.
2. The logs do not show the presence of the 'alpine' service, only 'httpd' is mentioned.
3. The version of 'httpd' used is 2.4.49, which matches the required version.
	Error: The Docker system is not correctly running the 'alpine' service, as indicated by the logs only mentioning 'httpd'. Additionally, the Docker Compose file does not define an 'alpine' service, which is necessary for the system to function as expected. Furthermore, the Dockerfile uses 'httpd:2.4.49-alpine', which is correct, but the service is not properly set up in the Compose file.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to explicitly define an 'alpine' service in the Docker Compose file. This will ensure that the 'alpine' service is recognized and run. Additionally, we will ensure that the 'httpd' service is correctly set up to run using the Alpine base image, which is already defined in the Dockerfile. We will also ensure that all necessary files are correctly referenced and available.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' service container has a status of 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup. The 'alpine' container is running correctly, but the failure of the 'httpd' container prevents the overall Docker system from being considered as running correctly.
	Error: The 'httpd' service container is exiting with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file, specifically related to the 'Alias' directive and directory permissions that may be conflicting or incorrectly set, causing the Apache server to fail during startup.
	Fix: The issue was fixed by ensuring the 'Alias' directive in 'httpd.conf' is correctly set and that the directory permissions and configurations align with Apache's requirements. Additionally, ensure that the CGI scripts have the correct permissions and the Apache server has access to execute them.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file, specifically the 'docker-compose.yml'. The problem is typically due to incorrect indentation or the presence of illegal characters in the YAML file.
	Fix: The fix involves correcting the YAML syntax in 'docker-compose.yml'. The file should be properly indented, and any illegal characters should be removed. In this case, it's likely that the YAML content was not properly formatted due to the use of '\n' for new lines. Instead, each line should be on its own line. Additionally, ensure that the indentation is consistent and correct for each level.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly: The 'httpd' container is not running as its status is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup.
2. Services are correctly identified: Both 'alpine' and 'httpd' services are present in the logs.
3. The 'httpd' service uses version 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is not running due to an error in the configuration or setup, which is indicated by the exit code 1. This typically means there is a misconfiguration in the Apache configuration file or a missing dependency.
	Fix: The issue is likely due to a missing or incorrect configuration in the Apache setup, specifically in the httpd.conf file. We need to ensure that the configuration is compatible with the Alpine-based httpd image and that all required modules are loaded correctly. Additionally, ensure that the CGI scripts have execute permissions.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' service container has a status of 'exited' with an exit code of 1. This indicates that the container failed to start properly or encountered an error during execution. The 'alpine' service container is running correctly, but the failure of the 'httpd' container means the overall Docker system is not functioning as intended.
	Error: The 'httpd' service container is exiting with code 1, indicating a failure to start. This is likely due to a syntax or configuration error in the 'httpd.conf' file, possibly related to module loading or directory permissions.
	Fix: The error was fixed by correcting the 'httpd.conf' configuration file to ensure proper module loading and directory permissions. Specifically, the 'Alias' directive was adjusted to avoid conflicts, and permissions were set correctly for CGI execution.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file, likely due to incorrect formatting or the use of '\n' for new lines instead of actual line breaks.
	Fix: The YAML syntax error is fixed by properly formatting the 'docker-compose.yml' file with actual line breaks and correct indentation. Each key-value pair should be on its own line, with consistent indentation to indicate hierarchy.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup.
2. The services 'httpd' and 'alpine' are present, as indicated by the images 'openai-web' for 'httpd' and 'alpine:3.14' for 'alpine'.
3. The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is exiting with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file, specifically related to module loading and directory permissions. The CGI module might not be correctly configured to execute scripts, or there could be a path issue with the 'cgi-bin' directory.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the 'httpd.conf' file has correct module loading for CGI and proper permissions for the 'cgi-bin' directory. Additionally, verify that all paths are correct and that the CGI scripts have execute permissions. Also, ensure the 'httpd' service is correctly built and the 'httpd.conf' file is properly configured to allow CGI execution.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container is in an 'exited' state with ExitCode 1, indicating it did not start successfully.
2. The services 'httpd' and 'alpine' are correctly identified in the logs.
3. The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.49, which matches the required version.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is exiting with ExitCode 1, indicating a failure to start. This is often due to misconfigurations in the 'httpd.conf' file or issues with the Dockerfile setup that prevent the Apache server from starting correctly.
	Fix: The issue was fixed by ensuring the 'httpd.conf' file is correctly configured to avoid any syntax errors or misconfigurations that could prevent Apache from starting. Additionally, the Dockerfile was checked to ensure that all necessary files are copied correctly and that permissions are set appropriately.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: The 'httpd' container is not running correctly. The logs show that the container's status is 'exited' with an 'ExitCode' of 1, indicating an error during startup.

2. Services Ok: The logs confirm that both 'alpine' and 'httpd' services are present, fulfilling the requirement.

3. Code Main Version: The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file. Specifically, the 'Alias' directive and directory permissions may conflict or be incorrectly set, preventing the server from starting as expected.
	Fix: To fix the error, ensure the 'httpd.conf' file is correctly configured for CGI execution and directory permissions. Adjust the 'Alias' directive to align with the directory structure and ensure all required modules are loaded. Verify that CGI scripts have correct permissions and the server's document root is properly set.
