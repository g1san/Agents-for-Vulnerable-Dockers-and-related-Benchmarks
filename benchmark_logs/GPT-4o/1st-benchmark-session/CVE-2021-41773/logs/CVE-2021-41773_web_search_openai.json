    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a path traversal vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. This flaw allows attackers to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" unauthorized access can occur. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these aliased paths, remote code execution is possible. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, leading to CVE-2021-42013.",
