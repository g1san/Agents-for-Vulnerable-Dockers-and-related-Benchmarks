{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 due to a flaw in path normalization. This allows attackers to perform a path traversal attack, potentially accessing files outside the intended directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default \"require all denied\" configuration, the attack can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled, it could lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild and only affects version 2.4.49, not earlier versions.",
