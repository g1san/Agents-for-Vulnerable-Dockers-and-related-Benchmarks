Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' where 'Running' is 'False' and 'ExitCode' is '1', meaning the container has exited with an error.
2. The logs do not mention the 'debian' service, indicating that not all required services are present.
3. The 'httpd' service is present and is using version 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The Docker container is not running because the 'debian' service is missing, which is required for the system setup. Additionally, the configuration and setup might not be complete, leading to the container exiting with an error code.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to add a 'debian' service to the Docker Compose file. This will serve as the base operating system for the Apache HTTP Server. We will use 'debian:bullseye-slim' as the base image for the 'debian' service. Additionally, ensure that the configurations and paths are correctly set up so that the services can start without errors.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running Correctly: The 'httpd' container is not running correctly. It has exited with an ExitCode of 1, indicating an error during startup. The 'debian' container is running fine, but since both containers must be running for the Docker system to be considered running correctly, this goal is not achieved.

2. Services Provided: The logs indicate the presence of both 'httpd' and 'debian' services, fulfilling the requirement for the services provided.

3. Version of 'httpd': The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.49, which matches the required version, so this goal is achieved.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits with an ExitCode of 1, which typically indicates a configuration error or missing dependencies during the startup of the Apache server. The error might be due to the misconfiguration in the httpd.conf file or missing modules.
	Fix: The error was fixed by ensuring that all necessary modules required for httpd to run are loaded in the configuration file and removing any duplicate LoadModule directives. Additionally, the configuration paths were verified to ensure correctness.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly. The container with the 'httpd' service has a status of 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating that it is not running.

The services are correctly identified as 'httpd' and 'debian'.

The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.49, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits with code 1, which usually indicates a misconfiguration or missing dependency in the Apache configuration or Dockerfile setup.
	Fix: The issue is likely due to the Apache HTTP Server configuration or the Dockerfile setup. To fix this, ensure that all necessary modules are loaded and the configuration is correct. Additionally, check for any syntax errors in the configuration file and ensure that the Dockerfile correctly sets up the environment. The error could also be due to the vulnerability CVE-2021-41773, which allows path traversal. Ensure that the configuration does not expose sensitive directories and that permissions are set correctly.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error occurred during its execution. The 'debian' container is running correctly. The services used are 'httpd' and 'debian', which matches the required services. The 'httpd' version used is 2.4.49, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the Apache HTTP Server setup. The likely cause is an issue in the 'httpd.conf' configuration or the Dockerfile setup, which prevents the Apache server from starting correctly. Additionally, the server is vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773, which allows path traversal, indicating a need for secure configuration.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the Apache configuration is correct and that the server is able to start without errors. This involves verifying the 'httpd.conf' file for any misconfigurations and ensuring that all necessary modules are loaded correctly. Additionally, address the CVE-2021-41773 vulnerability by securing directory permissions and avoiding path traversal risks. This includes setting 'AllowOverride' to 'None' in the root directory and ensuring that sensitive directories are not exposed.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because the 'httpd' container is not running. The logs show that the 'httpd' container has exited with an exit code of 1, which indicates an error occurred during startup. While the 'debian' service is running correctly, the 'httpd' service is not, which affects the overall Docker system status. The 'httpd' version used is 2.4.49, which matches the required version, so that goal is achieved.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is exiting with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the Apache HTTP Server setup. The current configuration in 'httpd.conf' may not be sufficient for the server to start correctly, possibly due to missing essential modules or incorrect directory permissions.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that all essential modules required by Apache are loaded and that the directory permissions are correctly set to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, verify the configuration paths and directives to ensure they are correct and do not conflict with each other. Specifically, ensure that the 'LoadModule' directives are correct, and the 'Directory' permissions are properly configured to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because one of the containers, specifically the 'httpd' container, is not running. The logs indicate that the 'httpd' container has a 'Status' of 'exited' with an 'ExitCode' of 1, which means it failed to start or crashed immediately after starting. This prevents the Docker system from achieving its goal of having all containers running correctly. However, the services 'httpd' and 'debian' are present, and the 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is exiting with code 1 due to a configuration issue in the Apache HTTP Server. The 'httpd.conf' file might have incorrect or missing configurations, causing the server to fail to start. Additionally, there might be permission issues or missing modules that are required for the server to run correctly.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that necessary modules are loaded, and configurations are correct. Specifically, verify the 'httpd.conf' for any syntax errors or misconfigurations. Ensure that the DocumentRoot directory and other directories have the correct permissions. Check that all required modules are loaded and that there are no conflicting configurations. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfile correctly sets the environment for Apache to run.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the Docker build process is failing because it cannot find the Debian 'buster' release files. This is because the 'buster' release has been archived and is no longer available in the standard repositories, resulting in 404 errors when trying to access them.
	Fix: To fix the issue, update the base image used in the Dockerfile to a more recent version of Debian that is still supported and available in the repositories. Since the service version requirement specifies 'bullseye-slim' for Debian, we need to ensure that the Dockerfile uses this version. This involves updating the Dockerfile to use the 'bullseye-slim' image for running the necessary commands.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' showing 'Status': 'exited', 'Running': False, 'ExitCode': 1, which means the container did not start successfully.
2. The only service present in the logs is 'httpd'. The 'debian' service is missing.
3. The 'httpd' service version is 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The Docker Compose setup is missing the necessary service to run Debian as a separate service, which is causing the 'httpd' service to fail due to missing dependencies or misconfigurations related to the Debian environment. Additionally, the Dockerfile may not be correctly setting up the required environment for the Apache HTTP Server to run properly.
	Fix: To address the issue, we will ensure that the 'debian' environment is correctly set up as part of the 'httpd' service build process within the Dockerfile. This involves ensuring that all necessary packages and configurations are installed and correctly set up in the build stage. We will also ensure that the Apache HTTP Server is configured to run correctly with the specified version and necessary modules. A separate 'debian' service is not required as the base image already incorporates the Debian environment.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates a YAML syntax issue in the 'docker-compose.yml' file. The specific error message 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' suggests that there is a problem with the formatting of the YAML file, likely due to incorrect indentation or misplaced colons.
	Fix: To fix the error, the YAML syntax in the 'docker-compose.yml' file needs to be corrected. YAML is sensitive to indentation and structure, so it is important to ensure that all elements are properly aligned and formatted. In this case, the issue can be resolved by ensuring that each level of the YAML hierarchy is correctly indented with spaces (not tabs) and that colons are used correctly to denote key-value pairs.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs:** The container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section where 'Running' is false and 'Status' is 'exited' with 'ExitCode' 1.

2. **Services Ok:** The logs only mention the 'httpd' service. There is no mention of the 'debian' service, indicating that not all required services are present.

3. **Code Main Version:** The 'httpd' version is 2.4.49, which matches the specified version requirement.
	Error: The Docker system was not running correctly because it was missing the installation of the Apache HTTP Server within the Debian environment. The Dockerfile was using Debian as a build environment but not as a runtime environment, which caused the httpd service to not start properly.
	Fix: To fix the issue, the Dockerfile needs to be adjusted to ensure that the Apache HTTP Server is correctly installed and configured within the Debian environment. This involves using Debian as the base image and installing the Apache HTTP Server within it. Additionally, the configuration files need to be correctly copied and permissions set to ensure the server can start.
