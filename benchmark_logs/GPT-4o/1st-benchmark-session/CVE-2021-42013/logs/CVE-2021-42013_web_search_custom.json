    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. It allows for path traversal attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) if CGI scripts are enabled. The vulnerability arises from an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-41773, allowing attackers to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. This issue does not affect versions prior to 2.4.49.",
