Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Containers Running:** The Nginx container is not running correctly. It exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup.

2. **Services Provided:** The logs show the presence of the following services: Joomla, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin, and Nginx. Therefore, all the required services are present.

3. **Joomla Version:** The Joomla container is using version 4.2.7, which falls within the specified range of 4.0.0---4.2.7. Hence, the Joomla version is correct.
	Error: The Nginx container is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates a configuration issue or a missing dependency. In this case, it's likely due to the Nginx configuration file or an incorrect setup in the Docker Compose file.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the Nginx configuration is correctly set up to communicate with the Joomla service. Additionally, we need to make sure that the Nginx service has a valid configuration file and the correct dependencies are specified in the Docker Compose file.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker system does not run correctly because the NGINX service is not running. The logs indicate that the NGINX container has exited with an exit code of 1, which suggests an error during startup.
2. All required services ['joomla', 'mysql', 'php', 'phpmyadmin', 'nginx'] are present in the logs.
3. The Joomla version used is 4.2.7, which is within the specified range of 4.0.0---4.2.7.
	Error: The NGINX service is not starting because the configuration file may be missing or incorrect. The proxy_pass directive might be misconfigured, or the NGINX service might be unable to connect to the Joomla service due to network issues between containers.
	Fix: The fix involves ensuring that the NGINX configuration file is correctly set up and that the NGINX service is correctly linked to the Joomla service. Additionally, the Docker Compose file should correctly map the necessary ports and volumes, and the NGINX configuration should define the upstream server correctly.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs**: The Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start.
2. **Services Ok**: The Docker setup includes all the specified services: 'joomla', 'mysql', 'php', 'phpmyadmin', and 'nginx'.
3. **Code Main Version**: The 'joomla' service is using version 4.2.7, which is within the specified range of 4.0.0 to 4.2.7.
	Error: The error causing the 'nginx' container to exit with code 1 is likely due to a misconfiguration in the 'nginx.conf' file or an issue with the service dependencies. The 'proxy_pass' directive in the Nginx configuration is set to 'http://joomla:80', which assumes that the 'joomla' service is accessible on port 80. However, the 'joomla' service is mapped to port 8080 on the host. Therefore, the Nginx configuration should be adjusted to correctly route traffic to the 'joomla' service.
	Fix: To fix the issue, update the 'nginx.conf' file to route traffic to the correct port for the 'joomla' service. Change the 'proxy_pass' directive from 'http://joomla:80' to 'http://joomla:8080'. This ensures that Nginx correctly forwards requests to the Joomla service running on port 8080 within the Docker network.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running:
   - The Nginx container is not running correctly. Its status is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure during startup.

2. Services Check:
   - The logs show containers for 'joomla', 'mysql', 'phpmyadmin', and 'nginx'. The 'php' service is implicitly included as part of the Joomla and phpMyAdmin setups, fulfilling the requirement.

3. Joomla Version:
   - The Joomla container is using version 4.2.7, which is within the specified range (4.0.0---4.2.7).
	Error: The Nginx container fails to start due to an incorrect port mapping in the Nginx configuration. The 'proxy_pass' directive is pointing to 'http://joomla:8080', which is incorrect because the Joomla service is exposed on port 80 inside the container (mapped to 8080 externally).
	Fix: To resolve the issue, update the 'proxy_pass' directive in the 'nginx.conf' file to point to 'http://joomla:80', which is the correct internal port for the Joomla service. This ensures Nginx correctly routes traffic to the Joomla container.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: The 'nginx' container is not running correctly as its status is 'exited' with an ExitCode of 1, indicating an error occurred during its execution.

2. Services Ok: The logs indicate that the services 'joomla', 'mysql', 'phpmyadmin', and 'nginx' are present. However, 'php' is not explicitly listed as a separate service, but it is typically integrated with 'joomla' and 'phpmyadmin' containers, which use PHP internally.

3. Code Main Version: The 'joomla' service is using version 4.2.7, which is within the specified range of 4.0.0---4.2.7.
	Error: The 'nginx' container is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates an error in the configuration or startup process. In this setup, the error is likely due to the absence of a required file or incorrect configuration settings in the Nginx or Joomla setup.
	Fix: The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Nginx configuration is correctly set to communicate with the Joomla service. The 'proxy_pass' directive in 'nginx.conf' was updated to point to the correct service name and port. Additionally, the Docker Compose file was reviewed to ensure all services are correctly defined and dependencies are properly managed.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because the 'nginx' container is not running. It exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start. All required services are present, including 'joomla' which is using version 4.2.7, a valid version within the specified range.
	Error: The 'nginx' container is not running due to a missing or incorrect configuration in the 'nginx.conf' file. The 'proxy_pass' directive is misconfigured, causing the Nginx server to fail to start.
	Fix: The issue is resolved by ensuring that the 'nginx.conf' file correctly points to the Joomla service. The 'proxy_pass' directive should be set to 'http://joomla:80' to correctly route traffic to the Joomla container. Additionally, ensure that the Nginx configuration file is properly formatted and that all necessary files are present and correctly mapped.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: The Nginx container is not running correctly. Its status is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start or an error during execution.

2. Services Ok: The logs show containers for 'mysql', 'joomla', 'phpmyadmin', and 'nginx', but there is no explicit mention of a separate 'php' service being used. PHP may be bundled with Joomla or phpMyAdmin, but without explicit confirmation, it cannot be assumed as a separate service.

3. Code Main Version: The Joomla version used is 4.2.7, which falls within the specified range of versions (4.0.0---4.2.7). Therefore, this goal is achieved.
	Error: The Nginx container exits with code 1 because it cannot find or properly connect to the Joomla service. This is often due to incorrect configuration or missing dependencies.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the Nginx service is correctly configured to communicate with the Joomla service. This involves checking that the Nginx configuration file is correct, the Docker Compose file specifies the right dependencies, and all necessary files are correctly mapped and available.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: One of the containers, specifically the 'nginx' container, is not running. Its status is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating it failed to start successfully. This means the Docker containers are not all running correctly.

2. Services Ok: The logs show containers for 'joomla', 'mysql', and 'phpmyadmin', but 'php' is not explicitly listed as a separate service, although it might be embedded within the 'joomla' or 'phpmyadmin' containers. The 'nginx' service is present but not running. Therefore, not all specified services are running correctly.

3. Code Main Version: The 'joomla' version used is 4.2.7, which is within the specified range of 4.0.0---4.2.7, so this goal is achieved.
	Error: The 'nginx' service is failing to start because it cannot connect to the 'joomla' service. This is likely due to a mismatch in port configuration or a missing dependency in the Docker Compose setup.
	Fix: The fix involves ensuring that the 'nginx' service correctly forwards requests to the 'joomla' service. The 'nginx' service should be configured to listen on the appropriate port and forward requests to the correct internal port of the 'joomla' service. Additionally, ensure that the 'nginx' service is started after the 'joomla' service is fully operational.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not all running correctly: The 'nginx' container is not running as its state is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure during startup.
2. All required services are present: 'joomla', 'mysql', 'phpmyadmin', and 'nginx'.
3. The 'joomla' version used is 4.2.7, which is within the specified range of 4.0.0---4.2.7.
	Error: The 'nginx' container is exiting with code 1, indicating a failure during startup. This is likely due to an incorrect configuration or missing dependencies in the setup. The 'nginx.conf' might not be correctly set up to communicate with the 'joomla' service, or there could be an issue with the service dependencies in the 'docker-compose.yml'.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the 'nginx' configuration is correctly set up to communicate with the 'joomla' service. Verify that the 'nginx.conf' file is correctly configured for reverse proxying to the 'joomla' service. Additionally, check that the 'docker-compose.yml' file correctly specifies the service dependencies and that all necessary files are correctly mapped. The 'proxy_pass' directive should point to the correct internal network address and port of the 'joomla' service, which is typically 'http://joomla:80'.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because the NGINX container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup. All required services (joomla, mysql, php, phpmyadmin, nginx) are present, and the Joomla version is within the specified range (4.2.7).
	Error: The NGINX container exits with an error code of 1 due to a missing or misconfigured configuration file. The provided NGINX configuration file lacks some essential settings required for a successful startup and proper communication with the Joomla service.
	Fix: To fix the error, ensure that the 'nginx.conf' file includes a valid server block and proper configuration settings. Additionally, make sure that the volumes are correctly mapped and that all services are properly configured in the 'docker-compose.yml' file. The 'proxy_pass' directive should point to 'http://joomla:80', which is the correct internal port for the Joomla service.
