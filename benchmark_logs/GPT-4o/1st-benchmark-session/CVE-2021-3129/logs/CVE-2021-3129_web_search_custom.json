    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Laravel framework, specifically affecting the Ignition package before version 2.5.2. This vulnerability is present in Laravel versions up to 8.4.2 when debug mode is enabled. It arises from insecure usage of PHP functions like file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(), allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating log files and serialized objects. The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild, emphasizing the need to update to Laravel versions beyond 8.4.2 and Ignition versions beyond 2.5.2.",
