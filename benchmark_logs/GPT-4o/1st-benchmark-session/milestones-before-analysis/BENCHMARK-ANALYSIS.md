# CVE-2016-5734
None of the modes is able to pass the 'main\_service\_version' milestone. The description of the CVE for all web search result actually identify the expected version as vulnerable. The milestone is not passed because the LLM is not instructed to include multiple ranges in the answer and even if they are included (see 'openai') they are not checked during the assessment phase. 
- **CONCLUSION**: 'main\_service\_version' can be considered passed.
- **SUGGESTION**: correct the code to handle these issues.

# CVE-2020-7247
None of the modes is able to pass the 'main\_service\_version' milestone. The expected version is **_opensmtpd:6.6.1p1_** while:
- Both 'custom' modes propose the range \[6.6, 6.6.1\]
- 'openai' proposes just the 6.6 version
Manual search showed that the vulnerable version is **_OpenSMTPD 6.6_**.
- **CONCLUSION**: 'main\_service\_version' can be considered passed.
- **SUGGESTION**: correct the _1p1_ part of the expected version.

# CVE-2020-11651 & CVE-2020-11652
None of the modes is able to pass the 'main\_service\_identified' milestone. The expected service is **_saltstack:2019.2.3_** but this is not the official Docker image, instead the official one is named **_saltstack/salt:x.y.z_**, which is the one suggested by all modes.
- **CONCLUSION**: 'main\_service\_identified' can be considered passed.
- **SUGGESTION**: correct the expected service.

# CVE-2021-3129
- 'custom' mode provided an almost identical answer to 'custom\_no\_tool' (as expected) but mis-tagged the 'MAIN' service, causing it to fail both 'main\_service\_identified' and 'main\_service\_version' milestones.
    - **CONCLUSION**: this can be considered an hallucination and both milestones must be considered as failed.
- 'openai' mode suggests two 'MAIN' services, the correct one (**_laravel_**) and another one named **_ignition_** which is actually identified as the culprit of the CVE in Laravel services (see [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-3129)).
    - **CONCLUSION**: this is an honest mistake from the LLM, moreover the correct services and versions have been identified.
    - **SUGGESTION**: ask professors how to handle these cases.

# CVE-2021-34429
'custom\_no\_tool' mode is not able to pass the 'main\_service\_version' milestone. The description of the CVE for in the web search result logs shows that the LLM correctly identified the expected version as vulnerable. The milestone is not passed because the LLM is not instructed to include multiple ranges in the answer and even if they are included (see 'openai') they are not checked during the assessment phase. 
- **CONCLUSION**: 'main\_service\_version' can be considered passed.
- **SUGGESTION**: correct the code to handle these issues.

# CVE-2021-42013
'openai' mode provides two identical services both tagged as 'MAIN' instead of having a single one with a range, causing it to fail both 'main\_service\_identified' and 'main\_service\_version' milestones.
- **CONCLUSION**: this can be considered an hallucination and both milestones must be considered as failed.

# CVE-2021-44228
None of the modes is able to pass the 'main\_service\_identified' and 'main\_service\_version' milestones. The expected service/version is **_solr:8.11.0_**, while the one official one (see [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-3129)) is **Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0**
- Both 'custom' modes provide **_log4j_** as 'MAIN'
    - **CONCLUSION**: both milestones can be considered passed.
    - **SUGGESTION**: correct the expected service.
- 'openai' mode provides two different services both tagged as 'MAIN', the correct one and **_openjdk_** which should be tagged as 'AUX' instead.
    - **CONCLUSION**: this can be considered an hallucination and both milestones must be considered as failed.

# CVE-2022-22947
Both 'custom' modes fail the 'main\_service\_version' milestone. The expected version is 3.1.0 but it is not included in the provided range \[3.0.0, 3.0.6\]. [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-22947) lists as vulnerable all versions in the range \[3.0.0, 3.0.6\] and version 3.1.0.
- **CONCLUSION**: 'main\_service\_version' can be considered passed.
- **SUGGESTION**: correct the code to allow the LLM to include multiple ranges and specific versions for the 'MAIN' service.

# CVE-2023-23752
Both 'custom' modes fail the 'aux\_roles\_ok' milestone.
- **CONCLUSION**: looks like a mistake by the LLM, considering the milestone as failed.
- **SUGGESTION**: ask professors how to handle these cases.

# CVE-2023-42793
None of the modes completes the 'main\_service\_identified', by checking Vulhub again it is clear that there was an error on my part in interpreting the 'MAIN' service.
- **CONCLUSION**: 'main\_service\_identified' can be considered passed.
- **SUGGESTION**: correct the expected service to **_jetbrains/teamcity-server_**
