    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 pertains to a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 through 9.4.38.v20210224. In these versions, the default compliance mode permits requests with URIs containing `%2e` or `%2e%2e` segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. For instance, a request to `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the `web.xml` file, potentially exposing sensitive information about the web application's implementation.",
