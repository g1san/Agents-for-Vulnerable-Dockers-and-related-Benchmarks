    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. It allows attackers to gain admin privileges without authentication due to an improperly secured default installation. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) on port 4369. The vulnerability is mitigated in CouchDB version 3.2.2 and later, which require a new cookie value and bind epmd and the distribution port to localhost.",
