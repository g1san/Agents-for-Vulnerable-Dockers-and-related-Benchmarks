{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, commonly known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, a widely used Java-based logging library. This flaw allows for remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) features in Log4j 2. The vulnerability affects Apache Log4j 2 versions from 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0, excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. In these versions, JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not adequately protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI-related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From Log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. In versions 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.",
