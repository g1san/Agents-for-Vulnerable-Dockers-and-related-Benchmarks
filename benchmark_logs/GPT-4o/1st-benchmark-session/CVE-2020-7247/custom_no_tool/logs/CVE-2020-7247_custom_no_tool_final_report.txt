Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version of the 'opensmtpd' package (6.6.0-r0) is not available in the Alpine 3.11 package repository. The available version is 6.6.4p1-r1, which conflicts with the requested version.
	Fix: To fix the error, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install a compatible version of 'opensmtpd' that is available in the Alpine 3.11 repository. Since the available version is 6.6.4p1-r1, which is outside the specified range, we should adjust the version constraint to allow this version. However, since the task specifies to use versions within the range 6.6 to 6.6.1, we will need to ensure that the package version aligns with this requirement. If no such version is available, we may need to build the package from source or find an alternative solution that respects the version constraints.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Runs**: The container is not running correctly. The 'State' of the container shows 'Status': 'exited' and 'Running': false, with an 'ExitCode' of 1, indicating an error occurred during execution.

2. **Services Ok**: The container uses the 'opensmtpd' service, as indicated by the 'com.docker.compose.service' label and the 'Path' pointing to '/usr/sbin/smtpd'. The 'alpine' service is not explicitly mentioned in the logs, but the focus here is on 'opensmtpd', which is present.

3. **Code Main Version**: The logs do not provide specific version information for 'opensmtpd'. The 'Image' field references 'custom_no_tool-opensmtpd', but without explicit version details, it cannot be confirmed if it falls within the 6.6---6.6.1 range.
	Error: The container exits with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the smtpd.conf file, which is vulnerable to CVE-2020-7247. This vulnerability allows remote code execution through improper input validation. The configuration file does not properly handle input, leading to potential security issues and causing the service to fail.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to update the smtpd.conf file to mitigate the CVE-2020-7247 vulnerability by ensuring proper input validation. This involves modifying the configuration to use safer practices, such as explicitly defining valid domains and actions, and avoiding wildcard matches that could be exploited.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information to assess whether the Docker containers are running correctly, whether they use the specified services, or if the correct version of 'opensmtpd' is being used.
	Error: The Docker system terminates due to the absence of logs, which suggests that the container might not be starting correctly. This could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect service configuration, missing files, or issues with the Dockerfile setup.
	Fix: To address the issue, we need to ensure that the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are correctly configured. The Dockerfile should install the correct version of 'opensmtpd' that is available in the Alpine 3.11 repository. Since the specified version range is 6.6 to 6.6.1, we need to ensure that the package version aligns with this requirement. Additionally, we should ensure that all necessary files, such as the smtpd.conf, are correctly copied and configured. The docker-compose.yml should correctly define the service and network settings.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information to assess whether the Docker containers are running correctly, whether they use the specified services, or whether they use the specified version of 'opensmtpd'. Without any log data, none of the goals can be verified.
	Error: The Docker system terminates due to an incorrect version of 'opensmtpd' being installed, which is outside the specified range. Additionally, the logging configuration might not be capturing logs correctly, leading to empty logs.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the correct version of 'opensmtpd' is installed by using a specific package repository that contains the required version. Additionally, adjust the logging configuration to ensure logs are captured correctly. This involves ensuring the logging driver is set up properly and that the log files are accessible.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version of 'opensmtpd' (6.6.1-r0) is not available in the Alpine 3.11 repository. The available version is 6.6.4p1-r1, which is outside the specified range of 6.6 to 6.6.1. This causes the package manager to fail when trying to install the specified version.
	Fix: To resolve this issue, we need to manually download and install the 'opensmtpd' package version 6.6.1-r0 from a reliable source that provides this specific version. This can be done by downloading the package file and installing it using 'apk add'. This approach ensures that we adhere to the version constraints while allowing the Docker build to succeed.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version of the 'opensmtpd' package (6.6.1-r0) is not available in the Alpine 3.11 repository, resulting in a 404 Not Found error when attempting to download it.
	Fix: To fix the error, we need to manually download the 'opensmtpd' package version 6.6.1-r0 from a reliable source that provides this specific version. This can be done by downloading the package file and installing it using 'apk add'. This approach ensures that we adhere to the version constraints while allowing the Docker build to succeed. We will host the package on a custom server or use a local file to ensure availability.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Dockerfile attempts to copy a file 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' that does not exist in the build context. This results in a failure to calculate the checksum for the file, causing the build process to terminate.
	Fix: To fix the error, ensure that the 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' file is present in the build context directory before running the Docker build command. This can be achieved by downloading the file from a reliable source and placing it in the same directory as the Dockerfile. Additionally, remove the obsolete 'version' attribute from the 'docker-compose.yml' file to avoid confusion.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Dockerfile attempts to copy a file 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' that does not exist in the build context. This results in a failure to calculate the checksum for the file, causing the build process to terminate.
	Fix: To fix the error, ensure that the 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' file is present in the build context directory before running the Docker build command. This can be achieved by downloading the file from a reliable source and placing it in the same directory as the Dockerfile. Additionally, ensure that the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are correctly configured to use the specified versions of services.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Dockerfile attempts to install a specific version of the OpenSMTPD package (opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk) from a local file, but the file is either missing or corrupted, leading to an IO ERROR during the installation process.
	Fix: To fix the error, ensure that the 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' file is correctly placed in the build context and is not corrupted. Additionally, verify that the file is accessible and has the correct permissions. If the file is missing, download it from a reliable source and place it in the correct directory. Ensure that the Dockerfile correctly references the file path.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates an IO ERROR when trying to install the 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' package. This suggests that the file might be missing, corrupted, or inaccessible during the build process.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the 'opensmtpd-6.6.1-r0.apk' file is correctly placed in the build context and is not corrupted. Additionally, verify that the file is accessible and has the correct permissions. If the file is missing, download it from a reliable source and place it in the correct directory. Ensure that the Dockerfile correctly references the file path.
