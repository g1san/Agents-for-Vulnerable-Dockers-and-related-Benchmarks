    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt software, affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, which fails to properly validate method calls. This flaw allows remote, unauthenticated users to access certain methods, enabling them to retrieve user tokens from the salt master and execute arbitrary commands on salt minions.",
