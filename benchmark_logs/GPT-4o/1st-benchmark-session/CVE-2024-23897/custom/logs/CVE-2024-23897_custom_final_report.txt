Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the package 'openjdk-11-jdk' cannot be found in the package repositories configured in the Docker image. This is likely due to the base image 'jenkins/jenkins:2.441' not including the necessary repository to find this package.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the package repositories are correctly configured to include the 'openjdk-11-jdk' package. Since the 'jenkins/jenkins:2.441' image is based on Debian, we can add the Debian package repository that contains the 'openjdk-11-jdk'. This can be done by adding the 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main' repository to the sources list. Additionally, we can install the 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' package instead, which is often available and sufficient for running Jenkins.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The Docker build process fails because the package 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' is not available in the configured repositories. The logs suggest that the package might have been replaced by 'openjdk-17-jre-headless'. Additionally, there are warnings about duplicate entries in the sources list, which can cause confusion and potential conflicts during package installation.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the package repositories are correctly configured and that we are installing a compatible version of OpenJDK that is available in the repositories. Since 'openjdk-11-jdk-headless' is not available, we should use the 'openjdk-11-jdk' package instead, which is the specified version in the requirements. Additionally, we should remove any duplicate entries in the sources list to avoid warnings. We will also update the Dockerfile to ensure it uses the correct package for Java 11.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the package 'openjdk-11-jdk' is not found in the package repository. This is likely due to the base image 'jenkins/jenkins:2.441' not having access to the necessary repositories to install 'openjdk-11-jdk'.
	Fix: The fix involves switching to a base image that already includes the necessary version of OpenJDK. The 'jenkins/jenkins:2.441' image should be replaced with 'jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11', which includes OpenJDK 11 by default. This eliminates the need to install OpenJDK separately and ensures compatibility with Jenkins.========== Test Passed! Generated Code (Final Version) ==========
