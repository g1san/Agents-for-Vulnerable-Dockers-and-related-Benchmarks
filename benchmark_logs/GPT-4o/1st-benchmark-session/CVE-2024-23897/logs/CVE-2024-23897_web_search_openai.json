    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins' built-in command line interface (CLI) that allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. This issue arises from the CLI command parser's feature that replaces an '@' character followed by a file path in an argument with the file's contents. This feature is enabled by default in affected versions. The specific vulnerable versions are Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, and LTS 2.426.2 and earlier.",
