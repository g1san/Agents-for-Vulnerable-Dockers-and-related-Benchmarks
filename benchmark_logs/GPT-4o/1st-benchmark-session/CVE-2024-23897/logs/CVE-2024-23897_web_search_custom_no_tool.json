    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, specifically affecting its command line interface (CLI). The vulnerability arises from the args4j library used by Jenkins to parse command arguments. This library feature, enabled by default, allows an @ character followed by a file path in an argument to be replaced with the file\u2019s contents. This flaw permits attackers with Overall/Read permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. Attackers without this permission can still read the first few lines of files. The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution (RCE) if certain conditions are met, such as the \"Resource Root URL\" functionality being enabled and the CLI WebSocket endpoint being accessible. Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, and LTS 2.426.2 and earlier, are affected. The issue is addressed in Jenkins 2.442, LTS 2.426.3, and LTS 2.440.1 by disabling the problematic command parser feature. Disabling CLI access is recommended as a workaround.",
