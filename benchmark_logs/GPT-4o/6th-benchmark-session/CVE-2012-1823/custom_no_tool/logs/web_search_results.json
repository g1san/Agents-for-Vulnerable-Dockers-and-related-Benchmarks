    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical vulnerability in the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) implementation of PHP, specifically affecting versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2. This vulnerability arises due to improper handling of query strings that lack an equals sign, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The issue is caused by PHP-CGI's failure to skip a particular php_getopt case for the 'd' option, enabling attackers to inject command-line options into the query string. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server. Exploitation involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests, allowing attackers to retrieve and execute code on the server. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous for servers running PHP in CGI mode without proper configuration to prevent such attacks. It is recognized as a Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. The vulnerability was discovered by Eindbazen and publicly disclosed after a delay due to patching challenges.",
