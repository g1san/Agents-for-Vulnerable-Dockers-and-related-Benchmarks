    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical security vulnerability found in the PHP CGI component. It arises when PHP is used in a CGI-based setup, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code through a query string that begins with a \"-\" character. This vulnerability can be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system. The flaw is significant because it can be exploited remotely without authentication, making it a critical concern for systems running vulnerable versions of PHP in a CGI configuration. Attackers can manipulate PHP arguments to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the improper handling of the URI when a URL lacks the '=' character. This allows attackers to pass additional arguments to the php-cgi binary, potentially displaying the source code of a PHP script or executing commands on the target server. This vulnerability is associated with PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.2.",
