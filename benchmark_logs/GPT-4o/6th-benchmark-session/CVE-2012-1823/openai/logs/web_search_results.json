    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical security vulnerability in PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2 when configured as a CGI script. The flaw is due to improper handling of query strings lacking an equals sign, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by injecting command-line options. This results from inadequate input validation in the `php_getopt` function. The vulnerability is actively exploited and listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.",
