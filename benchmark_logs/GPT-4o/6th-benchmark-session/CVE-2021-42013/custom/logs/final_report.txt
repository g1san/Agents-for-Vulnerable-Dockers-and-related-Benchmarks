CVE description: CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability identified in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability arises due to an incomplete fix for a previous issue, CVE-2021-41773. It allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks, which can map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the default configuration directive 'require all denied,' unauthorized access can occur. Moreover, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server. This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper configuration and patch management, as it affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The issue was addressed in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.51.
Attack Type: path traversal and remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49', '2.4.50']] Apache HTTP Server is the main service affected by CVE-2021-42013, with specific versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 being vulnerable to path traversal and remote code execution.
- [SOFT][debian][['bullseye']] Debian Bullseye is a Linux distribution that provides the operating system environment necessary for running the Apache HTTP Server.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker container for the Apache service is configured to expose port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host. This means the service is not using its default network port on the host, as it is mapped to a different port externally.
	- ERROR: The original Docker Compose file uses Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49, which is vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013. Additionally, the network configuration exposes port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host, which does not align with the goal of having services available on their default network ports. The .htaccess file also grants full access, which is insecure.
	- FIX: To resolve the issues, update the Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.51, which contains the fix for CVE-2021-42013. Adjust the Docker Compose configuration to map port 80 of the container directly to port 80 on the host for default access. Modify the .htaccess file to restrict access appropriately.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): 1. Code Hard Version: The Docker code specifies the use of 'httpd:2.4.51', which is not one of the versions listed ('2.4.49', '2.4.50').
2. Services Ok: The Docker code only specifies the use of 'httpd:2.4.51' and does not include 'debian' as a service.
	- ERROR: The Docker Compose file is using Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.51, which is not one of the vulnerable versions (2.4.49, 2.4.50) listed in the CVE description. The goal is to demonstrate the vulnerability using a vulnerable version, so the version needs to be changed to either 2.4.49 or 2.4.50.
	- FIX: To address the issue, the Docker Compose file should be modified to use 'httpd:2.4.49', which is one of the vulnerable versions. This allows the demonstration of the CVE-2021-42013 vulnerability in a controlled environment. All other configuration details remain the same to ensure the setup is immediately deployable and accessible.
