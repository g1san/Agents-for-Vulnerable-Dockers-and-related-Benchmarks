    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability identified in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability arises due to an incomplete fix for a previous issue, CVE-2021-41773. It allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks, which can map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the default configuration directive 'require all denied,' unauthorized access can occur. Moreover, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server. This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper configuration and patch management, as it affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The issue was addressed in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.51.",
