    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability found in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability allows for a path traversal attack, enabling attackers to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. The issue stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773. If the server is configured with the 'require all denied' directive disabled, attackers can exploit this flaw to access files outside the intended directories. Furthermore, if CGI scripts are enabled, this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper configuration and timely updates to mitigate security risks.",
