    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This flaw is due to an inadequate fix for the earlier CVE-2021-41773 vulnerability, allowing a path traversal attack. This can map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these external files are not protected by the configuration directive \"require all denied,\" unauthorized access is possible. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability only affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, with earlier versions unaffected.",
