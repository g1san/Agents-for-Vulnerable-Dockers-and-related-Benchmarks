    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal vulnerability identified in Grafana, an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. This security flaw affects Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0, excluding specific patched versions. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access local files on the server hosting Grafana by exploiting a particular URL path. By manipulating the URL path, attackers can perform directory traversal attacks, enabling them to read arbitrary files on the server. This could expose sensitive information, including configuration files and system data. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5, indicating a high severity level. Users are advised to upgrade to the patched versions: 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, or 8.3.1.",
