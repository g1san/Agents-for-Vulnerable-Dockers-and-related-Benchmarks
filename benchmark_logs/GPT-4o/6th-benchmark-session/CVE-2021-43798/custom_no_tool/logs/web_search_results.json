    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal vulnerability affecting Grafana, a widely used open-source platform for data visualization and monitoring. The vulnerability exists in Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0 and allows unauthorized attackers to read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the `/public/plugins/:pluginId` endpoint. This flaw arises from improper sanitization of user-specified file paths, enabling attackers to traverse directories and access sensitive files, such as the system's `/etc/passwd` file or Grafana's SQLite database. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it particularly dangerous. Attackers can extract configuration files and potentially decrypt stored credentials, leading to further system compromise. Grafana Labs released patches on December 7, 2021, and recommended upgrading to versions 8.3.1, 8.2.7, 8.1.8, or 8.0.7 to mitigate the risk. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed as a zero-day, and many instances remain vulnerable due to delayed patching.",
