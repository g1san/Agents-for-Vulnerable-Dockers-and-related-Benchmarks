    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a security vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty that allows attackers to craft URIs using specific encoded characters to access the content of the WEB-INF directory and/or bypass certain security constraints. This directory typically contains sensitive configuration files and resources not intended for direct client access. Exploiting this vulnerability can enable an attacker to retrieve files such as `web.xml`, which may disclose information about the application's structure and security configurations. This issue is a variation of a previously reported vulnerability, CVE-2021-28164.",
