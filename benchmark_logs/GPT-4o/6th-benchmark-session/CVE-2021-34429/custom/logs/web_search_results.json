    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability found in the Eclipse Jetty server, specifically affecting versions 9.4.37 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of encoded URIs that allow path traversal attacks. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted URIs containing encoded characters like '%u002e' to access protected files within the WEB-INF directory, such as 'WEB-INF/web.xml'. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks. The issue is due to Jetty's default compliance mode, which inadequately normalizes paths, allowing unauthorized access to restricted resources. The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.3 and can be mitigated by updating Jetty to versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, or 11.0.6, where URI decoding is restored before normalization.",
