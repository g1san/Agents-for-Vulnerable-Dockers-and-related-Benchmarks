    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability affecting both the Apache HTTP Server and Eclipse Jetty web server. For Apache HTTP Server, versions 2.4.48 and earlier are affected by a flaw in handling HTTP/2 requests, which can cause a denial of service by triggering a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication. For Eclipse Jetty, the vulnerability affects versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. It allows sensitive file disclosure through path traversal using encoded URIs to access files within the WEB-INF directory. This can expose sensitive information by bypassing security constraints, making it a significant security concern that has been addressed in later versions.",
