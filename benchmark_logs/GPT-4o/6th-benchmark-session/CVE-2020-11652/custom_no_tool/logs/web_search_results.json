    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a critical vulnerability found in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management and orchestration tool. The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of input data, allowing unauthorized access to certain methods within the Salt API. This can lead to directory traversal attacks, enabling attackers to read arbitrary files from the server. The vulnerability is exploitable via the Salt Master, which listens on TCP ports 4505 and 4506 by default. This exposure can potentially allow attackers to access sensitive information from the Salt Master and compromise the system's security. The issue is specifically found in the salt-master process's ClearFuncs class, where methods fail to properly sanitize paths, allowing authenticated users to access arbitrary directories. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it allows attackers to read sensitive files like `/etc/shadow` and upload malicious files to the system. The affected versions are Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2.",
