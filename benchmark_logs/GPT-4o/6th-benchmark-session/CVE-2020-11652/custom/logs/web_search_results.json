    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack, a configuration management tool used for managing and automating infrastructure. This vulnerability affects the Salt Master server, which is responsible for sending commands to Salt Minions (client systems). The flaw resides in the improper handling of file paths within the ClearFuncs class of the salt-master process. This allows attackers to bypass directory traversal protections, leading to unauthorized access to the file system. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send specially crafted requests to the Salt Master, enabling them to read or write arbitrary files on the server. This can result in the exposure of sensitive information, such as the contents of /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow, and can also allow attackers to upload malicious files to critical directories, potentially leading to remote command execution. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it does not require authentication, making it easy for attackers to exploit if the Salt Master server is exposed to the internet. Affected versions include SaltStack Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to versions 2019.2.4, 3000.2, or later to mitigate this vulnerability.",
