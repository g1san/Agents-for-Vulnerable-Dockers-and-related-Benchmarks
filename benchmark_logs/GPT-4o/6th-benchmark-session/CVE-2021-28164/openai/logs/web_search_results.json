    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 and 9.4.38.v20210224. The issue arises from Jetty's default compliance mode, allowing URIs with encoded dot (`%2e`) or double dot (`%2e%2e`) segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. This directory typically contains sensitive configuration files that are not meant to be publicly accessible. The vulnerability stems from Jetty's implementation of RFC3986 regarding URI decoding. While RFC allows for certain encoded characters, Jetty's handling of these segments can lead to unauthorized access, exposing sensitive information and potentially facilitating further attacks. CVSS v3.1 assigns this a base score of 5.3, indicating medium severity.",
