    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting the `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp` package. It impacts versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft URIs using encoded characters to access the contents of the WEB-INF directory or bypass security constraints. The issue arises because the default compliance mode permits requests with URIs containing a `%u002e` segment to access protected resources, like the `web.xml` file, potentially revealing sensitive information. Encoded null characters can prevent correct normalization, enabling unauthorized access. The vulnerability was patched in versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6 by restoring the order of URI decoding and normalization to prevent such attacks. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating moderate severity, with no privileges required for exploitation and no user interaction needed.",
