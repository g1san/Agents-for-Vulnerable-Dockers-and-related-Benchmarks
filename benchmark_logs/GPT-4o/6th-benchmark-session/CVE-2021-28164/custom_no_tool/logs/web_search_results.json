    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability affecting the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically in the `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp` package. This vulnerability is present in versions 9.4.37 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. The issue arises because the default compliance mode in Jetty allows requests with URIs containing encoded segments, such as `%2e` or `%2e%2e`, to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, such as `web.xml`, by bypassing security constraints. The vulnerability is due to improper URI normalization, allowing encoded characters to bypass access controls. This vulnerability can be exploited without any privileges or user interaction, making it a significant security risk. The issue was mitigated in later versions by restoring the process of decoding URIs before normalization, preventing unauthorized access through URI manipulation.",
