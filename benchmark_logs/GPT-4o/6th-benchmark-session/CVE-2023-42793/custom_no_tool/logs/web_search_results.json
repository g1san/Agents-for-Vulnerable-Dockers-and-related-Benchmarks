    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability found in JetBrains TeamCity, a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code on the TeamCity server, leading to potential theft of source code, service secrets, and private keys, as well as control over build agents. The vulnerability is attributed to a specific path expression in the server's request interceptors, which can be exploited to bypass authentication. This issue affects TeamCity server versions 2023.05.3 and below, but not TeamCity Cloud. It was discovered on September 6, 2023, and has been actively exploited in the wild by threat actors, including APT29, to execute remote code and deploy malware. JetBrains addressed this vulnerability in TeamCity version 2023.05.4 by removing the wildcard expression that enabled the bypass. The vulnerability has a CVE score of 9.8 due to its ease of exploitation and significant impact.",
