    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability affecting JetBrains TeamCity versions before 2023.05.4. It allows unauthenticated attackers with HTTP(S) access to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially gaining administrative control over the server. The flaw arises from a misconfiguration in TeamCity's request interceptor, which uses a wildcard pattern '/**/RPC2' that lets attackers bypass authentication checks. Attackers can exploit this by accessing the REST API endpoint for token creation, enabling them to generate authentication tokens for any user, including those with administrative privileges. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to source code repositories, exposure of stored service secrets and private keys, control over connected build agents, and potential contamination of build artifacts, posing a significant risk to organizational security.",
