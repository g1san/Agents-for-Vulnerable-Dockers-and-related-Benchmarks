    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability affecting JetBrains TeamCity, a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting a flaw in the authentication mechanism. The issue arises from a request interceptor that fails to apply authorization checks to specific paths, enabling attackers to bypass authentication. This vulnerability poses significant risks, including the potential theft of source code, service secrets, and private keys, control over build agents, and the possibility of injecting malicious code into build artifacts. The vulnerability affects TeamCity versions 2023.05.3 and below and has been actively exploited by threat actors, including suspected nation-state actors, to gain unauthorized access and deploy malware for persistence and further exploitation. JetBrains has released a fix in version 2023.05.4 and advises users to upgrade or apply a security patch plugin to mitigate the risk.",
