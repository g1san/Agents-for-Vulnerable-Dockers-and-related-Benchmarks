    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 that involves a flaw in the path normalization process. This flaw allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks, which can map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the default configuration 'require all denied,' the attacker can access them. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled, this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution by exposing the source of interpreted files. The vulnerability was initially reported by Ash Daulton and the cPanel Security Team. It was known to be exploited in the wild and affects only Apache 2.4.49. The issue was partially addressed in version 2.4.50 but was not fully resolved until version 2.4.51. Mitigation involves upgrading to version 2.4.51 or later, auditing directory access permissions, and ensuring that sensitive directories are not publicly accessible.",
