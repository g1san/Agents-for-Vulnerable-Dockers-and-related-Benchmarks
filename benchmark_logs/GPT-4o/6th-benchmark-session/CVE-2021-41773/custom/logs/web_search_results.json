    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability found in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The flaw is due to an error in path normalization, which allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks. This means that an attacker can craft a request to map URLs to files outside the expected document root of the server. If these files are not protected by the 'require all denied' directive, attackers can access them, potentially leaking sensitive information or the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability is critical and was actively exploited in the wild. It was reported by Ash Daulton and the cPanel Security Team and was fixed in version 2.4.51. To mitigate this issue, users are advised to update Apache to version 2.4.51 or later or ensure that 'require all denied' is configured for the document root.",
