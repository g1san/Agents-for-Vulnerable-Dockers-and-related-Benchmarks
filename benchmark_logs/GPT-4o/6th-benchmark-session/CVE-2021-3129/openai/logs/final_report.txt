CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a critical vulnerability identified in the Ignition package, a debugging and error-handling tool used in Laravel applications. This flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The issue arises from insecure usage of PHP functions `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()` within Ignition. Specifically, the `MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution` component lacks proper path validation, enabling attackers to exploit stream wrappers like `phar://` to write arbitrary files and trigger deserialization attacks. This can lead to remote code execution without authentication. The vulnerability is particularly exploitable on sites running Laravel in debug mode with versions prior to 8.4.2.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['7.3', '7.4', '8.0']] PHP is required to run Laravel and Ignition. Vulnerable versions are those compatible with Laravel 8.0.0 through 8.4.2.
- [HARD][composer][['1.10', '2.0']] Composer is necessary for managing Laravel dependencies. Vulnerable versions are those compatible with Laravel 8.0.0 through 8.4.2.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is used as the database backend for Laravel applications.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.19']] Nginx is used as the web server to host Laravel applications.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
