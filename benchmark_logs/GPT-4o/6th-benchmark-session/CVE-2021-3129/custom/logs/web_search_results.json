{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a vulnerability in the Laravel PHP framework, specifically affecting the Ignition package used for error handling. It allows for remote code execution when the application is in debug mode. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of PHP object deserialization, particularly involving the Monolog logging library. Attackers can craft a malicious PHAR file and leverage the Laravel Ignition component to deserialize it, leading to code execution on the server. This vulnerability affects Laravel versions up to 8.4.2 and Ignition versions before 2.5.2. Exploitation involves manipulating log files, converting them to PHAR format, and deserializing them to execute arbitrary code. It is critical to ensure that debugging is disabled in production environments to mitigate this risk.",
