    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt software, specifically affecting the salt-master service. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt master server as well as all connected minions. The issue arises due to improper authentication checks in the ClearFuncs class of the salt-master process, specifically within the `publish` and `run` functions. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to the exposed TCP ports (default port 4506) of the salt-master, leading to potential unauthorized access and control over the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can retrieve the root key, execute commands on all active minions, and read or write files on the Salt Master. It is crucial for Salt master servers to be updated with the necessary patches to mitigate this security risk. The vulnerability affects SaltStack Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2.",
