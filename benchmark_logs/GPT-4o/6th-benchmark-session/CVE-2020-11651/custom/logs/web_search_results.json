    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management and orchestration tool. The flaw is found in the Salt master server, specifically within the ClearFuncs class, which is responsible for handling method calls between the master and its minions. The vulnerability arises from improper authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt master and its connected minions. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and potential system compromise. The vulnerability affects Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. Exploiting this vulnerability involves sending specially crafted requests to the Salt master's default port (4506), enabling attackers to execute commands, retrieve sensitive information, and manipulate files on the server. It is crucial to patch affected systems to prevent exploitation.",
