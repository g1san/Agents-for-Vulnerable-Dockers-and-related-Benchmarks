CVE description: CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt software affecting versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. It allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands and retrieve user tokens due to improper validation in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 and has been actively exploited, compromising numerous systems globally.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][salt-master][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The `salt-master` service is the central controller in a SaltStack environment, responsible for sending commands to and managing `salt-minions`. Versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000.2 are vulnerable to CVE-2020-11651.
- [HARD][salt-minion][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The `salt-minion` service runs on the client machines and receives commands from the `salt-master`. While the primary vulnerability resides in the `salt-master`, having `salt-minions` is essential to demonstrate the full impact of the exploit.
- [SOFT][python][['3.7']] Python is required to run SaltStack services. Version 3.7 is compatible with the vulnerable versions of SaltStack.
- [SOFT-CACHE][redis][['5.0.7']] Redis can be used as an external job cache for SaltStack, providing enhanced performance and scalability.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.17.10']] Nginx can serve as a reverse proxy or web server in the SaltStack environment, facilitating web-based interfaces or API interactions.
