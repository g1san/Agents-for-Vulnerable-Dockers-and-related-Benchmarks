    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a security vulnerability identified in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, which allows an attacker to include and potentially execute arbitrary files on the server. This issue arises from improper validation of whitelisted pages during page redirection and loading within phpMyAdmin. An attacker must be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, except in specific configurations: - If the configuration setting `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']` is set to `true`, an attacker can specify any host under their control and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin. - If the configuration setting `$cfg['ServerDefault']` is set to `0`, it bypasses the login requirement, allowing the vulnerable code to run without any authentication. The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8, indicating a high severity level.
