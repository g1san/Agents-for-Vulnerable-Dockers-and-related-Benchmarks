    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability arises due to improper input validation, allowing attackers to bypass filters using the \"%253f\" character. This bypass enables unauthorized access to local files on the server. If exploited, it can lead to remote code execution by including PHP code in a SQL query and accessing session files to execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability is tied to the failure of the Core::checkPageValidity function to properly validate URL paths, allowing manipulation of the $_REQUEST['target'] parameter to include arbitrary files. Exploitation typically requires authentication, but certain configurations can allow unauthenticated exploitation.",
