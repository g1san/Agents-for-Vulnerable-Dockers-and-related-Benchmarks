    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation, allowing attackers to perform directory traversal and file inclusion attacks. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can include files from the server, potentially leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability is specifically linked to a filter bypass using the \"%253f\" character, which can be used to include files from the server. Attackers need to know the PHPMyAdmin URL endpoint, have cookies for an authenticated user, and know the full path of the file to be retrieved. If an attacker can include a session file containing PHP code, it can be executed by querying a SELECT SQL statement with the PHP code. The vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by manipulating URLs to access session files stored in specific directories, such as the \\tmp\\ directory in a XAMPP setup.",
