{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a remote code execution vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, an open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) for Unix servers. The issue affects OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2 and earlier. The vulnerability exists in the smtp_mailaddr() function, which improperly validates sender and recipient email addresses. An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted SMTP message with the MAIL FROM or RCPT TO fields containing shell metacharacters. The server improperly handles these inputs, potentially executing arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the daemon, often running as root. This can result in control over the mail server, enabling further attacks such as denial-of-service, data loss, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the network. The vulnerability was found in OpenSMTPD as used in OpenBSD 6.6 and earlier versions. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to update OpenSMTPD to version 6.6.2 or later.",
