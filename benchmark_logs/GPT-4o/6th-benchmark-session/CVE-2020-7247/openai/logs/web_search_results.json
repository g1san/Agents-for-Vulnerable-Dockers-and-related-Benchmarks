    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a critical security vulnerability found in OpenSMTPD version 6.6, used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges via a specially crafted SMTP session, exploiting improper input validation in the `MAIL FROM` field. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of shell metacharacters in the `smtp_mailaddr` function within the `smtp_session.c` file. This issue affects the default configuration of OpenSMTPD, making systems vulnerable without configuration changes.",
