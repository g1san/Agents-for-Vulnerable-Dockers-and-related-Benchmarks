{
    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical security vulnerability identified in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, as well as LTS versions 2.426.2 and earlier. This flaw resides in Jenkins' Command Line Interface (CLI) command parser, which utilizes the args4j library to process command arguments. The parser includes a feature that interprets an '@' character followed by a file path as an instruction to replace the argument with the contents of the specified file. In the affected Jenkins versions, this feature is enabled by default, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.",
    "attack_type": "This vulnerability enables unauthorized individuals to perform arbitrary file read operations on the Jenkins controller file system. By exploiting the CLI's argument parsing mechanism, attackers can access sensitive files without authentication, potentially leading to further security breaches.",
