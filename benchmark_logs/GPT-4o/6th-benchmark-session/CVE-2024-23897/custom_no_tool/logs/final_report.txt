CVE description: CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, an open-source continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) software. This vulnerability arises from the args4j library used by Jenkins to parse command-line arguments. Specifically, the library has a feature that interprets an '@' character followed by a file path as a directive to replace it with the file's contents. This feature is enabled by default in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, as well as LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. The vulnerability allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to read entire files on the Jenkins controller file system. Attackers without this permission can read the first few lines of files. The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution if attackers exploit cryptographic key retrieval from binary files. The issue is compounded by the "Resource Root URL" functionality and the CLI WebSocket endpoint. To mitigate the risk, Jenkins versions 2.442, LTS 2.426.3, and LTS 2.440.1 have disabled the command parser feature. Users who cannot update immediately are advised to disable CLI access as a workaround.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jenkins][['2.441', '2.426.2']] Jenkins is the core service affected by CVE-2024-23897. The vulnerability is present in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, as well as LTS 2.426.2 and earlier, due to the args4j library used for parsing command-line arguments.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['8-jdk']] OpenJDK provides the Java runtime environment necessary for running Jenkins.
