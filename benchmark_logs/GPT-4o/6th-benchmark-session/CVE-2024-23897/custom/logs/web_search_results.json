    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, which is a widely used automation server. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading via the Jenkins command line interface (CLI), potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE). The issue arises from Jenkins' use of the args4j library to parse command-line arguments. This library includes a feature that replaces an '@' character followed by a file path with the file\u2019s contents. This feature is enabled by default in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, as well as LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. Attackers with Overall/Read permission can read entire files, while those without this permission can read the first few lines. The vulnerability can be further exploited if attackers obtain cryptographic keys from binary files, enabling various RCE attacks under specific conditions. The issue has been addressed in Jenkins versions 2.442, LTS 2.426.3, and LTS 2.440.1 by disabling the command parser feature. A recommended workaround for those unable to update immediately is to disable CLI access.",
