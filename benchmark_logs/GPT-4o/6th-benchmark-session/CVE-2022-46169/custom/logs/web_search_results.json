    "desc": "CVE-2022-46169 is a command injection vulnerability in Cacti, a popular open-source network monitoring tool. This vulnerability affects versions up to 1.2.22 and allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Cacti. The flaw is located in the `remote_agent.php` file, which can be accessed without authentication. The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header and other parameters in a crafted GET request to the `/remote_agent.php` endpoint. If the IP address in the `X-Forwarded-For` header matches an entry in the poller table, the client is authorized, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it combines an authentication bypass with a command injection, allowing remote code execution without valid credentials. The issue is mitigated in Cacti versions 1.2.23 and later.",
