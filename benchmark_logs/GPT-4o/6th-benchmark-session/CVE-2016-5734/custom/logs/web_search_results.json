{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability affecting phpMyAdmin, a widely used web-based database management tool. It is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of user inputs in the table search-and-replace feature, specifically the improper delimiter selection in the preg_replace function, which fails to prevent the use of the 'e' (eval) modifier. This flaw can be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by crafting a special string. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have network access to the phpMyAdmin service and the ability to send crafted requests that trigger the vulnerability. This issue is part of a series of vulnerabilities affecting phpMyAdmin, including cross-site scripting and information disclosure. It is recommended to upgrade to phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.6, 4.4.15.10, or 4.0.10.19 or newer to mitigate these risks.",
