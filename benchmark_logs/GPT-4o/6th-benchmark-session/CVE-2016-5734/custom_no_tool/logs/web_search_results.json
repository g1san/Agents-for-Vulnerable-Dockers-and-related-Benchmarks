{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a security vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin, a popular web-based database management tool. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of parameters in the `preg_replace()` function, specifically due to the unsafe use of the `/e` modifier. This issue affects the 'find and replace' feature within phpMyAdmin, where user input is improperly concatenated into the first parameter of `preg_replace`. In affected versions, this can allow attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.x prior to 4.6.3, 4.4.x prior to 4.4.15.7, and 4.0.x prior to 4.0.10.16. The exploit is less effective in PHP versions 5.4.6 and above, as they do not allow null termination in `preg_replace` parameters, and PHP 7.0 and later versions do not permit code execution in `preg_replace`. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as code execution, data leakage, or privilege escalation.",
