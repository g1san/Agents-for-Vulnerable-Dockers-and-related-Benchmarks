    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability found in Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. It arises from the improper input validation in the routing functionality, where a user can provide a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) as a routing-expression. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and unauthorized access to local resources. Exploitation requires the attacker to send a specially crafted request to a server running a vulnerable version of Spring Cloud Function. The vulnerability is critical as it allows unauthorized users to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature, and it is recognized as a Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV), highlighting its active exploitation in the wild.",
