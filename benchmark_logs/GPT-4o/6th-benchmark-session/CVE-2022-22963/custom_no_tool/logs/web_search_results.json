    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability affecting Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. The vulnerability arises from the routing functionality, which allows an attacker to provide a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) as a routing expression. This can lead to remote code execution and unauthorized access to local resources. The vulnerability is particularly concerning for applications deployed on serverless platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. It is similar in impact to the Log4j vulnerability and has a low exploitation barrier, making it critical for users to patch promptly. The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3.",
