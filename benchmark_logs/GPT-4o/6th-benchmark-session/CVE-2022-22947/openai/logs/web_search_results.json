    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a critical code injection vulnerability found in VMware's Spring Cloud Gateway versions prior to 3.1.1 and 3.0.7. This flaw occurs when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled and exposed without sufficient security measures. It allows remote attackers to send specially crafted requests that lead to arbitrary code execution on the host. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions within the StandardEvaluationContext, permitting the execution of malicious SpEL expressions remotely.",
