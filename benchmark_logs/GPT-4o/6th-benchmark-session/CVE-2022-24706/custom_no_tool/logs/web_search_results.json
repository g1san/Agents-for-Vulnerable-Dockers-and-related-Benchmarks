    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability found in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable CouchDB installations without requiring authentication. The flaw arises from the use of an insecure default \"monster\" cookie value in Erlang node communications, which can be exploited to gain administrative privileges. Attackers can utilize the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) to execute commands via the Erlang/OTP Distribution Protocol. The vulnerability is particularly serious because it allows for privilege escalation and potentially unauthorized access to sensitive data or control over the database. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to update to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, change the default cookie, and limit network access to CouchDB ports.",
