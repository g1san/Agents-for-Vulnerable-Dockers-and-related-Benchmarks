    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. This vulnerability allows attackers to gain administrative privileges without authentication on improperly secured default installations. The issue arises due to the use of a default cookie value, \"monster,\" which is insecure and used for authentication between Erlang nodes. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a CouchDB instance's network port, which is managed by the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) running on a fixed port (4369). Once connected, attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely on the affected CouchDB instances. The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or higher, changing the default cookie value, and ensuring that EPMD and CouchDB distribution ports are bound to local interfaces only. Proper security measures, such as using a firewall, are also recommended to protect CouchDB installations from unauthorized access.",
