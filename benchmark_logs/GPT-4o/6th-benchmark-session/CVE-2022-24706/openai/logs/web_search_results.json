    "desc": "Apache CouchDB, an open-source NoSQL database, is susceptible to unauthorized access due to its default settings. In versions before 3.2.2, CouchDB initializes with configurations that expose a random network port bound to all available interfaces, intended for clustered operations and runtime introspection. A utility process called `epmd` advertises this random port to the network on a fixed port. Additionally, CouchDB's default installation uses a standard Erlang cookie value (\"monster\") for node-to-node communication authentication. These defaults can be exploited by attackers to connect to the database without authentication, thereby obtaining administrative privileges.",
    "attack_type": "This vulnerability allows an unauthorized remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. By exploiting the default configurations, the attacker can gain administrative access and perform actions such as data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, potentially leading to a complete system compromise.",
