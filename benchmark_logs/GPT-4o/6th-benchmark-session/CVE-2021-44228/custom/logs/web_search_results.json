{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as the Log4Shell vulnerability, is a critical security flaw in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used Java-based logging utility. This vulnerability allows remote code execution by unauthenticated users through the manipulation of log messages or parameters processed by Log4j 2. The exploitation occurs when user-controlled data is logged, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability affects numerous applications and services using Log4j 2 for logging purposes, posing a significant security risk due to its widespread use. Exploitation is facilitated by Log4j's support for Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups, which can be manipulated to load and execute malicious code from an attacker-controlled LDAP server. The vulnerability affects Log4j versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0, excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. The issue is specific to the log4j-core component and does not affect other Apache Logging Services projects like log4net or log4cxx. It can be mitigated by upgrading to Log4j versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, or 2.15.0, where the vulnerable behavior has been disabled or removed.",
