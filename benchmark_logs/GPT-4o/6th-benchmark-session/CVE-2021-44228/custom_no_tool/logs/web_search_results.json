{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used Java-based logging utility. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution when an attacker can control log messages or log message parameters. This is due to the library's handling of JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a server. The vulnerability affects Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1, and it is particularly severe because of the widespread use of Log4j in various applications and the ease with which it can be exploited. Attackers can send specially crafted requests to systems using Log4j 2, resulting in remote code execution via JNDI using LDAP. The vulnerability has led to various exploits, including information theft, backdoor installations, and cryptocurrency mining.",
