{
    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a critical vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Gateway, a component of the Spring ecosystem for building API gateways. The flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems by sending specially crafted requests to the Gateway Actuator endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation, leading to a code injection flaw. This can result in unauthorized control of the system, as attackers can manipulate application properties and execute arbitrary commands on the server. The issue affects Spring Cloud Gateway versions 3.1.0 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.6. Exploitation requires the Actuator endpoint to be enabled, exposed, and unsecured. Users are advised to update to a patched version to mitigate this risk.",
