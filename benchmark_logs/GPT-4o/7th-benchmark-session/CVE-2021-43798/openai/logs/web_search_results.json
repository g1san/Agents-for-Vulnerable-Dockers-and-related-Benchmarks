    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Grafana, affecting versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0, excluding specific patched versions. The flaw allows unauthorized access to local files on the server by exploiting a vulnerable URL path. This issue stems from improper handling of URL paths in the plugin asset serving functionality, enabling attackers to access files outside the intended directory structure. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5, indicating high severity.",
