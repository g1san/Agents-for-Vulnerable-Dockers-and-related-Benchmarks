    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a high-severity path traversal vulnerability in Grafana, a data visualization web application. It affects versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0, excluding patched versions. The vulnerability allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on a Grafana server by exploiting the /public/plugins/:pluginId API endpoint. Attackers can manipulate the file path to traverse directories and access sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd and the Grafana SQLite database. This exposure can lead to the extraction of sensitive information, including user credentials and configuration details. The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like curl with the --path-as-is argument or custom scripts. Despite a patch being released on December 7, 2021, many instances remain vulnerable, prompting users to upgrade to patched versions (8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, or 8.3.1) and rotate passwords if necessary.",
