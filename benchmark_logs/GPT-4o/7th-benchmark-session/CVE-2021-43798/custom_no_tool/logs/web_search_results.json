    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a path traversal vulnerability in Grafana, a popular open-source data visualization and monitoring tool. It affects Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive files on the server by exploiting a flaw in the Grafana API endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId`. The endpoint fails to properly sanitize user-provided file paths, enabling attackers to traverse directories and access files outside the intended scope. For instance, attackers can read the `/etc/passwd` file or the Grafana SQLite database, which contains user credentials and configuration secrets. This vulnerability does not require authentication, making it particularly dangerous as it can be exploited remotely with low complexity. The vulnerability was disclosed on December 3, 2021, and a patch was released on December 7, 2021. Users are advised to upgrade to the patched versions or use a reverse proxy to mitigate the risk.",
