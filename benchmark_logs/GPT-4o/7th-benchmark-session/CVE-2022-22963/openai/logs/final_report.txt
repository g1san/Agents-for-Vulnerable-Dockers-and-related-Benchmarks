CVE description: CVE-2022-22963 is a critical security vulnerability identified in Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and all preceding unsupported versions. This flaw arises from the framework's routing functionality, which, when improperly configured, allows attackers to inject malicious code through specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can achieve unauthorized execution of arbitrary code on the affected system, potentially leading to full system compromise and unauthorized access to local resources.
Attack Type: The vulnerability enables an attacker to perform remote code execution by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious SpEL expression in the `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` header. This expression is evaluated by the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][openjdk][['8-jdk']] Provides the Java Development Kit required to run Spring Cloud Function.
- [HARD][maven][['3.8.1']] Builds and manages Java-based projects, necessary for compiling and running the vulnerable Spring Cloud Function application.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21.3']] Acts as a reverse proxy to handle incoming HTTP requests and forward them to the Spring Cloud Function application.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Provides a relational database management system for the application to store and retrieve data.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
