    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability found in Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. It allows for remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in the routing functionality. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplies a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) as a routing expression. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host, enabling attackers to compromise the entire system or container. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous in cloud environments, where it can affect serverless functions like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. Exploiting this vulnerability is relatively straightforward, as attackers can use it to execute commands or open reverse shells on the vulnerable host. Users are advised to upgrade to versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3 to mitigate the issue. The vulnerability was discovered by m09u3r and has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature.",
