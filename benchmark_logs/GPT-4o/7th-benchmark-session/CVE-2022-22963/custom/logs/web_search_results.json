{
    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function, specifically affecting versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. This vulnerability arises from the routing functionality, which allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions through the HTTP request header `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` parameter. This flaw can lead to remote code execution (RCE), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host machine, potentially compromising the entire system. The vulnerability is particularly concerning for serverless functions on platforms like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. It has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature and ease of exploitation. To mitigate this issue, users should upgrade to versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3, where the vulnerability has been fixed.",
