    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt software, affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The vulnerability exists in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, which fails to validate method calls properly. This allows remote attackers to invoke methods without authentication, leading to scenarios such as retrieval of user tokens and execution of arbitrary commands on minions.",
