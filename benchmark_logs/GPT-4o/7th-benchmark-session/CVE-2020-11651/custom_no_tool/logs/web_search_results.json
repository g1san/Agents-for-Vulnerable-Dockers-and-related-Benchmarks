    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a vulnerability in SaltStack Salt, a configuration management tool, which affects the Salt master server. The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of method calls in the `ClearFuncs` class, allowing unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code on the master server. This vulnerability enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt master server and all connected minions, potentially leading to remote code execution. The flaw is present in Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000.2. Exploiting this vulnerability can allow attackers to gain control over the affected system, retrieve the root key, schedule commands, access the filesystem, and execute commands or read files on the server and its minions.",
