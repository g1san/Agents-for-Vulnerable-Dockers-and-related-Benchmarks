CVE description: CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management and orchestration tool used for managing and automating IT infrastructure. The vulnerability resides in the ClearFuncs class of the Salt master process, which is responsible for communication between the Salt master and its minions. Due to improper validation of method calls, unauthorized users can bypass authentication and access the Salt master's 'root key'. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely on both the Salt master and its connected minions, leading to potential full system compromise. The vulnerability affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2, and it can be exploited to retrieve sensitive data, execute commands, and manipulate connected minions. The flaw underscores the importance of securing Salt installations by updating to patched versions and implementing security best practices such as network segmentation and regular vulnerability assessments.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] SaltStack Salt is the main service that contains the vulnerability in its Salt master process, allowing unauthorized remote code execution.
- [SOFT][python][['3.8']] Python is required to run the SaltStack Salt service and to execute the proof of concept scripts that demonstrate the vulnerability.
