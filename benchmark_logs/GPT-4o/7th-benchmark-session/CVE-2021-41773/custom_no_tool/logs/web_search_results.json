    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. It is a path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive files and potentially execute arbitrary code if the mod_cgi module is enabled. The flaw arises from a change in the path normalization process, where URL-encoded traversal sequences can bypass security checks, allowing attackers to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If files outside the document root are not protected by \"require all denied,\" these requests can succeed, potentially leaking the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts. This issue was initially reported as a path traversal vulnerability but later found to also allow for remote code execution when certain conditions are met. The vulnerability only affects Apache 2.4.49 and was fixed in version 2.4.50, although the fix was incomplete, requiring a further update to version 2.4.51 to fully address the issue.",
