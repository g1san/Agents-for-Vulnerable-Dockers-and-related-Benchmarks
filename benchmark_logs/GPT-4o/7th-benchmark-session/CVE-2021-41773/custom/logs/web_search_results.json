    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. This flaw involves a path traversal attack, allowing attackers to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" requests can succeed, potentially leaking sensitive information or the source of interpreted files such as CGI scripts. If CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of user-supplied input, enabling directory traversal attacks. This issue was reported on September 29, 2021, and is known to be actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was initially addressed in version 2.4.50, but a complete fix was provided in version 2.4.51.",
