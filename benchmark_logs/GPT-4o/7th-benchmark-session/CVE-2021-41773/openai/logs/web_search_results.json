    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a path traversal vulnerability identified in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. This flaw allows attackers to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these external files are not protected by the default configuration directive \"require all denied,\" unauthorized access can occur. Furthermore, if Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are enabled for these aliased paths, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild, including in ransomware campaigns.",
