    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability in OpenSMTPD version 6.6, an open-source implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges due to improper input validation in the `smtp_mailaddr` function, where shell metacharacters in the `MAIL FROM` field are not adequately sanitized. This affects the default configuration of OpenSMTPD and is due to an incorrect return value upon input validation failure.",
