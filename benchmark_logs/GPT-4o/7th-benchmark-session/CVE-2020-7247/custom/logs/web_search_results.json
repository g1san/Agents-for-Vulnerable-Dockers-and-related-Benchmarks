    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, a mail server, that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The flaw arises from improper input validation in the smtp_mailaddr function within smtp_session.c, where dangerous characters from user-controlled input are not adequately escaped. This oversight allows attackers to exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted SMTP sessions with shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field. As a result, attackers can execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system. The vulnerability affects OpenSMTPD versions before 6.6.2 and was tested on various versions of OpenBSD, including 6.6, 6.5, 6.4, and 5.9. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on January 28, 2020, and has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature. Patches were published on January 29, 2020.",
