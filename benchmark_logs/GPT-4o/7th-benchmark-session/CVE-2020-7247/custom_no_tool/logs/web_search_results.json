    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability affecting OpenSMTPD, an open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) for Unix systems. The flaw exists in the smtp_mailaddr() function, which fails to adequately validate sender and recipient email addresses. This improper validation allows attackers to send a malformed SMTP message with the MAIL FROM or RCPT TO fields containing a blank domain followed by a malicious command. The server automatically fills in the blank domain and executes the command with the privileges of the daemon, often as root. This vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial-of-service attacks, data loss, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the network. The vulnerability affects OpenSMTPD versions after commit a8e222352f and before version 6.6.2. To mitigate the risk, it is recommended to update OpenSMTPD to version 6.6.2 or later.",
