    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability identified in JetBrains TeamCity versions prior to 2023.05.4. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass authentication mechanisms and execute arbitrary code remotely, thereby gaining administrative control over the server. The vulnerability arises from a misconfiguration in TeamCity's request interceptor implementation. Specifically, the system employed a wildcard expression '/**/RPC2' that inadvertently permitted bypassing authentication checks for any path ending with '/RPC2'. Attackers could exploit this by accessing the REST API endpoint for token creation, enabling them to generate authentication tokens for any user, including administrators. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to source code repositories, exposure of stored service secrets and private keys, control over attached build agents, and potential poisoning of build artifacts. This vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild, including in ransomware campaigns. JetBrains has addressed this issue in TeamCity version 2023.05.4. For users unable to upgrade immediately, JetBrains has provided security patch plugins compatible with TeamCity versions 8.0 and above.",
