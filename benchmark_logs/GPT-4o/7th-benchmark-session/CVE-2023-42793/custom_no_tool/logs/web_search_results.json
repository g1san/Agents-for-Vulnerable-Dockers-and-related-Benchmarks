    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity, a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) server. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the TeamCity server, enabling remote code execution. The issue arises from an authentication bypass due to a misconfigured request interceptor that disables authorization checks for requests ending with \"/RPC2\". This oversight allows attackers to create authentication tokens and gain unauthorized access, potentially leading to the compromise of source code, service secrets, private keys, and build artifacts. It affects TeamCity server versions 2023.05.3 and below, but not TeamCity Cloud. The vulnerability was actively exploited by threat actors, including suspected nation-state actors, to gain initial access to networks, create backdoors, and perform lateral movements. The issue has been patched in TeamCity version 2023.05.4.",
