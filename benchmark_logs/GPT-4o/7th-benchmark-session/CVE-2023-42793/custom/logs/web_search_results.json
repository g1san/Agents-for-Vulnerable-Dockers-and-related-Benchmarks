    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical security vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity, a continuous integration and build management server. This vulnerability allows remote code execution by unauthenticated users. The flaw arises from an authentication bypass in the request interceptors, specifically due to a path expression that inadvertently disables authorization checks for paths ending with /RPC2. This vulnerability affects TeamCity versions prior to 2023.05.4. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands, create new user accounts, and establish persistence through scheduled tasks and DLL injection. The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild, with attackers using custom scripts to gain initial access to vulnerable servers. It has been exploited by nation-state threat actors and was added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. The vulnerability underscores the importance of timely patching and robust security monitoring.",
