    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an authentication bypass vulnerability that affects Joomla! versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7. This vulnerability is due to improper access checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive information by querying specific endpoints without authentication. The vulnerability can leak information such as MySQL database credentials, which can be used to gain administrative access to the Joomla! web interface by changing the Super User's password. Once administrative access is obtained, attackers can execute arbitrary code by modifying templates or installing malicious plugins. Despite being initially considered low-risk, the potential for code execution has made it a target for attackers. It was discovered by Zewei Zhang from NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab and has been assigned a medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3. The vulnerability was patched in Joomla! version 4.2.8.",
