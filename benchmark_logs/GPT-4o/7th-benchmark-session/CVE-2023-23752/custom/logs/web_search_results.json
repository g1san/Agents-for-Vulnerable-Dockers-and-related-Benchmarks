    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability affecting Joomla! versions 4.0.0 to 4.2.7. Discovered by Zewei Zhang from NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab, this vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and access sensitive information such as MySQL database credentials. The flaw lies in Joomla's improper access checks to web service endpoints, specifically the RestAPI interface. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive installation information, enabling attackers to potentially change the Joomla! Super User's password, execute arbitrary code, or leak the Joomla! user database. The vulnerability is rated as medium severity but can lead to significant security risks including code execution under certain conditions. Affected users are strongly advised to upgrade to Joomla! version 4.2.8 or later to mitigate the risk.",
