CVE description: CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, an open-source continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) software. The vulnerability is identified as an arbitrary file read vulnerability that occurs through the command line interface (CLI) of Jenkins. It arises from the use of the args4j library to parse command arguments and options. A specific feature of this parser, enabled by default, allows the replacement of an "@" character followed by a file path in an argument with the file's contents. This flaw permits attackers with Overall/Read permission to read entire files on the Jenkins controller file system. Even attackers without this permission can read the first few lines of files. The vulnerability can be further exploited to perform remote code execution through various methods, including Resource Root URLs, "Remember me" cookies, stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection bypasses. It affects Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, including LTS versions 2.426.2 and earlier. The issue is resolved in Jenkins 2.442, LTS 2.426.3, and LTS 2.440.1 by disabling this command parser feature. Disabling access to the CLI is also recommended as a workaround to prevent exploitation.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jenkins][['2.441', '2.426.2']] Jenkins is the vulnerable service where the arbitrary file read vulnerability exists, allowing attackers to exploit the CLI to read files and potentially execute remote code.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['8-jdk']] OpenJDK is required to run Jenkins, as it is a Java-based application.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to securely expose Jenkins to the network.
