CVE description: CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability found in Jenkins, an open-source automation server commonly used for continuous integration and delivery. This vulnerability arises from the misuse of the args4j library within Jenkins' command-line interface (CLI). Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the 'expandAtFiles' feature, which is enabled by default in Jenkins 2.441 and earlier versions, as well as LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. This feature interprets an '@' character followed by a file path as a command to replace the argument with the file's contents. Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can exploit this to read entire files, while those without such permissions can read the first few lines of files. The vulnerability can potentially lead to remote code execution if sensitive files, such as cryptographic keys, are accessed. The vulnerability impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and is particularly dangerous if the Jenkins instance has the 'Resource Root URL' enabled and the CLI WebSocket endpoint is accessible. The issue is resolved in Jenkins 2.442 and later, where the problematic feature is disabled. A workaround involves disabling CLI access entirely to mitigate the risk.
Attack Type: Arbitrary File Read
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jenkins/jenkins][['2.441', '2.426.2']] Jenkins is the core service that contains the vulnerability. Versions 2.441 and earlier, including LTS 2.426.2 and earlier, are affected by CVE-2024-23897 due to the args4j library's 'expandAtFiles' feature.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['11-jdk']] Jenkins requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) to run. OpenJDK 11 is a compatible version for running Jenkins.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21.1']] Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy to manage incoming traffic to the Jenkins server, providing an additional layer of security and performance optimization.
