    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability arises due to improper input sanitization, allowing attackers to bypass filters using encoded characters like `%253f`. This bypass enables attackers to retrieve files from the server, potentially leading to remote code execution if a file containing malicious PHP code is included. The vulnerability is exploited by crafting HTTP requests that manipulate URL parameters, requiring authenticated user cookies and the full path of the file to be retrieved. This flaw can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, posing a significant security risk.",
