    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability identified in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, where an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. This issue arises from improper validation of whitelisted pages during page redirection and loading within phpMyAdmin. An attacker must be authenticated, except in specific configurations: If `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']` is set to `true`, the attacker can specify any host under their control and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin. If `$cfg['ServerDefault']` is set to `0`, the login requirement is bypassed, allowing the vulnerable code to run without any authentication. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform remote code execution on the server hosting phpMyAdmin.",
