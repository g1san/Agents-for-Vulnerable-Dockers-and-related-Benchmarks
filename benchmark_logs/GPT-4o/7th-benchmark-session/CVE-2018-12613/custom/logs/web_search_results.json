    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. This vulnerability is a local file inclusion (LFI) issue that can lead to remote code execution. The flaw exists due to improper input validation and inadequate URL path checks in the `Core::checkPageValidity` function, allowing attackers to exploit directory traversal techniques. An authenticated user can craft a malicious HTTP request to include arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution if PHP code is included in a session file. The vulnerability highlights the need for proper input validation, session management, and securing configurations to prevent unauthorized access and code execution.",
