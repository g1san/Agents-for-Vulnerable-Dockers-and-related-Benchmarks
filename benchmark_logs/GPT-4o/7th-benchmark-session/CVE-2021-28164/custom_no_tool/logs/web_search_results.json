    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting versions 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224, as well as versions 10.0.1 to 10.0.5 and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. The vulnerability arises from improper URI decoding, which allows attackers to craft URIs with encoded characters to access the protected WEB-INF directory. This can potentially bypass security constraints and expose sensitive information such as the web.xml file. The issue occurs because URIs containing segments like %2e or encoded null characters are not properly normalized, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. The vulnerability has been addressed in later versions by restoring URI decoding and normalization practices, and implementing checks to prevent aliasing attacks. It has a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating moderate severity.",
