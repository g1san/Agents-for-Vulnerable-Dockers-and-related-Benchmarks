    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is an information disclosure vulnerability found in Eclipse Jetty, a popular web server and servlet container. This vulnerability arises due to improper input validation in Jetty's default compliance mode, which allows remote attackers to access sensitive information. Specifically, by sending specially-crafted requests with URIs containing %2e or %2e%2e segments, attackers can bypass URI normalization and access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory, such as the web.xml file. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive web application implementation details and potentially enable further attacks against the system. The vulnerability affects Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224 and has a CVSS Base score of 5.3, indicating a moderate severity level. Mitigation involves enabling the HttpCompliance mode RFC7230NOAMBIGUOUS_URIS or upgrading to Jetty version 9.4.39 or later.",
