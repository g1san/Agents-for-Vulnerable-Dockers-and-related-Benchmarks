    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability affecting Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. It is an extension of the previously identified CVE-2021-41773, which was inadequately patched in version 2.4.50. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform path traversal attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files outside of the intended document root. If the server is misconfigured with 'require all granted', attackers can exploit crafted requests to map URLs to these files. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled, this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This highlights the importance of proper server configuration and input validation to prevent unauthorized access and potential system compromise.",
