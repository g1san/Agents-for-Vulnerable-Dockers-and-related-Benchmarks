    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server, specifically affecting versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability allows for path traversal and remote code execution when the mod_proxy module is enabled and certain configurations are present. The vulnerability arises due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773. Attackers can exploit this flaw by crafting URLs that access files outside the expected document root, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files and execution of arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous when CGI scripts are enabled, as it can lead to complete system compromise. It underscores the importance of proper configuration and timely updates to mitigate security risks.",
