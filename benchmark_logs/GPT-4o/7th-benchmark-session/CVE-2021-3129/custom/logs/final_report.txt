CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Laravel framework, specifically targeting the Ignition module, which is responsible for displaying error messages. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server without authentication by exploiting unsafe PHP usage. It affects Laravel versions before 8.4.2 and Ignition versions before 2.5.2, particularly when the debug mode is enabled. The vulnerability is similar to a log poisoning attack but requires PHP serializable code injection. Attackers can manipulate file read/write operations using PHP filters and send crafted POST requests to the /_ignition/execute-solution endpoint to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability has a high CVSSv3 score of 9.8 due to its ease of exploitation and potential to allow attackers to control the target system, compromising services and databases. Mitigation involves upgrading Laravel and Ignition to secure versions and disabling debug mode in production environments.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['7.3-apache', '7.4-apache']] PHP is the underlying scripting language for Laravel. The vulnerability exploits unsafe PHP usage in Laravel's Ignition module.
- [HARD][composer][['1.10', '2.0']] Composer is required for managing Laravel dependencies, including the Ignition module which is central to the vulnerability.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7', '8.0']] MySQL serves as the database for the Laravel application, necessary for a typical Laravel setup.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.19', '1.20']] Nginx is used as the web server to serve the Laravel application.
- [SOFT-CACHE][redis][['6.0', '6.2']] Redis is used for caching to improve the performance of the Laravel application.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
