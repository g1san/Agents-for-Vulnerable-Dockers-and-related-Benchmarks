    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Laravel framework, specifically targeting the Ignition module, which is responsible for displaying error messages. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server without authentication by exploiting unsafe PHP usage. It affects Laravel versions before 8.4.2 and Ignition versions before 2.5.2, particularly when the debug mode is enabled. The vulnerability is similar to a log poisoning attack but requires PHP serializable code injection. Attackers can manipulate file read/write operations using PHP filters and send crafted POST requests to the /_ignition/execute-solution endpoint to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability has a high CVSSv3 score of 9.8 due to its ease of exploitation and potential to allow attackers to control the target system, compromising services and databases. Mitigation involves upgrading Laravel and Ignition to secure versions and disabling debug mode in production environments.",
