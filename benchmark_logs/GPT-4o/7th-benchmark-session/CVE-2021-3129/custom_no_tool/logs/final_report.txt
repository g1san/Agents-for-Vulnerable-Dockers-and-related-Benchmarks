CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a critical vulnerability in the Laravel PHP framework, specifically targeting the 'Ignition' package used for debugging. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) on systems running Laravel versions prior to 8.4.2 and Ignition versions prior to 2.5.2. This exploit is particularly dangerous because it can be executed remotely without authentication if the Laravel application is exposed to the internet with debug mode enabled. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation and insecure use of functions like file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() in the Ignition component. Attackers can exploit this flaw by crafting malicious requests that lead to the deserialization of a PHAR file, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the server. The exploitation process involves manipulating the system's logging mechanism to inject and execute malicious code. Properly configuring environments to disable Ignition in production and updating to patched versions of Laravel and Ignition can mitigate this risk.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['7.3-apache', '7.4-apache']] PHP is required to run Laravel applications, and specific versions are needed to replicate the environment where the vulnerability exists.
- [HARD][composer][['1.10', '2.0']] Composer is necessary for managing PHP dependencies, including installing specific vulnerable versions of Laravel and Ignition.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is used as the database for the Laravel application, providing the backend storage needed for the application to function.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.19']] Nginx acts as a web server to serve the Laravel application, facilitating HTTP requests and responses.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
