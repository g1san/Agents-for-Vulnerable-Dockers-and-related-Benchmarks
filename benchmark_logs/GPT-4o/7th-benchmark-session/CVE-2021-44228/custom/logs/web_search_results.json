{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 logging library. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server by exploiting how Log4j processes user input through the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookup feature. Specifically, it affects versions 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1, where user-controlled data can be logged and lead to remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability is critical due to its high impact and ease of exploitation, affecting numerous Java-based applications and services that use Log4j 2. The issue is resolved in versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, and 2.15.0, where the risky behavior is disabled or removed.",
