    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as \"Log4Shell,\" is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used Java-based logging framework. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to the unsafe handling of log messages. Specifically, it exploits the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookup feature in Log4j, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems by sending specially crafted log messages. This issue affects Log4j versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.14.1, excluding 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it can be exploited without authentication and is prevalent across many Java applications and services using Log4j for logging. The vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized access, data theft, and system compromise. To mitigate the risk, it is recommended to upgrade to Log4j version 2.17.1 or later, which addresses this and other related vulnerabilities.",
