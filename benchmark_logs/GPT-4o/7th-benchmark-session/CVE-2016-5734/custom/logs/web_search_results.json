{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a critical vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin, a popular web-based database management tool used for managing MySQL databases. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The flaw exists in the table search and replace feature, where parameters are not properly sanitized before being passed to the `preg_replace()` function. This improper sanitization allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific string that, when processed by the vulnerable function, leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x prior to 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x prior to 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x prior to 4.6.3. Exploiting this vulnerability does not require authentication, making it particularly severe. It is recommended to upgrade to phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.10.16, 4.4.15.7, or 4.6.3 and later, or apply the patches provided in vendor advisories to mitigate the issue.",
