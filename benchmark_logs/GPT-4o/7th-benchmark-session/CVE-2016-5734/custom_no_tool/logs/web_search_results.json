    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin, specifically in versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The vulnerability arises from unsafe handling of parameters in the `preg_replace()` function, particularly due to improper delimiter selection that uses the 'e' modifier. This flaw allows for a remote code execution attack, where an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The vulnerability is triggered through the table search-and-replace functionality in phpMyAdmin, where input is not properly sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires valid phpMyAdmin credentials, and it is not exploitable on PHP versions greater than 5.4.6 due to changes in how null bytes are handled in regex operations. Users are advised to upgrade to phpMyAdmin version 4.6.3 or later, or apply the provided patches to mitigate the vulnerability. The issue is considered moderately severe and is part of a set of multiple vulnerabilities affecting phpMyAdmin, which also includes SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and information disclosure vulnerabilities.",
