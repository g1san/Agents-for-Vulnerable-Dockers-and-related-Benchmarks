    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a security vulnerability identified in Docker Engine versions prior to 1.12.1. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly joining and leaving a Docker Swarm cluster as a node. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can disrupt the normal operation of the Docker Swarm, leading to potential service outages and instability within the container orchestration environment.",
