    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical security vulnerability in PHP versions prior to 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, specifically when configured as a CGI script (`php-cgi`). The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of query strings without an equals sign (`=`) in the `sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c` file, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by injecting command-line options. This issue is linked to the improper handling of the `php_getopt` function for the 'd' case.",
