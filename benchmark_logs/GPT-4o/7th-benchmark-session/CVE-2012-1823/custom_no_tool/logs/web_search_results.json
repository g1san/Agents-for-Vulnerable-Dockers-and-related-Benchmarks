    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a critical vulnerability in PHP, specifically affecting versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2 when configured as a CGI script (php-cgi). The vulnerability arises from improper handling of query strings that lack an equals sign character, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. This is achieved by crafting a specific query string that bypasses intended security restrictions, enabling attackers to pass additional arguments to the php-cgi binary. The vulnerability allows for the retrieval of application source code or execution of arbitrary code on the server. Attackers can use options like '-s' to display source code and '-d' to change PHP configurations, sending PHP code in the HTTP request body. The vulnerability was discovered by Eindbazen during a CTF event and disclosed after a delay due to internal miscommunications. Exploitation can be conducted manually or automated using tools like Metasploit, which offers a specific exploit module for this vulnerability. The vulnerability is particularly notable in default XAMPP installations on Windows, which are vulnerable by default due to character encoding and \"Best-Fit\" behavior allowing bypass of patches. This issue affects PHP-CGI installations on Windows with locales like Japan, China, and Taiwan, and has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature and remote exploitability without authentication.",
