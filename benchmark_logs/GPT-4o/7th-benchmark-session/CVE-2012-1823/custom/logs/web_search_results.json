    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability affecting PHP versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, specifically within the php-cgi component. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of command-line arguments when PHP is configured to run as a CGI script. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or obtain sensitive information by crafting specific query strings. The attack can be executed by appending a query string that lacks the '=' character, enabling the attacker to pass additional arguments to the php-cgi command line. This can lead to unauthorized access or control over a server running a vulnerable version of PHP. Exploits for this vulnerability can reveal source code or execute code through the 'php://input' stream and modify PHP INI settings. It highlights the importance of proper input validation and timely security patches in CGI-based applications. This vulnerability is considered critical with a high CVSS score of 9.8 and is part of the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.",
