    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache CouchDB, affecting versions prior to 3.2.2. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the server where CouchDB is running without authentication, enabling them to gain administrative privileges. The vulnerability arises from CouchDB's default configuration, which uses a fixed Erlang cookie value ('monster') for authentication between nodes and advertises a random network port for clustering operations, making it susceptible to exploitation. The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild and has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, indicating high severity. It was publicly disclosed on April 26, 2022, and is included in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. Mitigations include upgrading to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or higher, setting up a firewall, and binding EPMD and CouchDB ports to localhost.",
