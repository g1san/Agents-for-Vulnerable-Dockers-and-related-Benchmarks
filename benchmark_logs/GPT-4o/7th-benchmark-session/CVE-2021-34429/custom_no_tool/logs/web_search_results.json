    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting the `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp` package in versions 9.4.37 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to exploit improperly handled encoded URIs to access sensitive files within the WEB-INF directory, which should be restricted. The flaw arises because URI decoding occurs after normalization, permitting access to protected resources through path traversal. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating moderate severity, and can be exploited over a network without requiring authentication, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.",
