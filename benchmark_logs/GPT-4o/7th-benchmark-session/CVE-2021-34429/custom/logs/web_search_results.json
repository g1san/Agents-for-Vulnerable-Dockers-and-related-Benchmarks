    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically within the org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp package. This vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.4.37 to 9.4.42, 10.0.1 to 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 to 11.0.5. The issue arises due to improper handling of encoded URIs, which allows attackers to access the WEB-INF directory by crafting special URIs such as /%u002e/WEB-INF/web.xml. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The vulnerability is characterized by the server's failure to properly normalize URIs after decoding, which could bypass security constraints, allowing access to protected resources. This issue has been addressed in Jetty versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.3, indicating a moderate severity level.",
