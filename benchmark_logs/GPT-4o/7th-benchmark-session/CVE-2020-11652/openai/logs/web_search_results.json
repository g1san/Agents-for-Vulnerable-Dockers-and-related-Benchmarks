    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a security vulnerability identified in SaltStack's Salt software, specifically affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, where certain methods fail to properly sanitize file paths. This oversight allows authenticated users to perform path traversal attacks, granting them unauthorized access to arbitrary directories on the server.",
