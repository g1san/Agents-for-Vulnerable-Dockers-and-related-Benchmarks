----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a security vulnerability identified in SaltStack's Salt software, specifically affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process, where certain methods fail to properly sanitize file paths. This oversight allows authenticated users to perform path traversal attacks, granting them unauthorized access to arbitrary directories on the server.
Attack Type: Path Traversal
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][salt-master][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The `salt-master` service is the central controller in a SaltStack environment, managing minions and executing commands. Versions listed above are vulnerable to CVE-2020-11652.
- [SOFT][salt-minion][['2019.2.3']] The `salt-minion` service acts as an agent that receives and executes commands from the `salt-master`. While not directly implicated in CVE-2020-11652, it is essential for establishing a functional SaltStack environment to demonstrate the vulnerability.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
