    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a critical vulnerability found in SaltStack, specifically affecting the Salt Master service. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the Salt Master server, enabling attackers to perform directory traversal attacks. Through this exploitation, attackers can read sensitive files (such as `/etc/passwd`), upload files to arbitrary locations, and execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability arises from improper path concatenation in the 'wheel' module, allowing attackers to escape path restrictions and access files outside intended directories. This flaw affects SaltStack versions earlier than 2019.2.4 and 3000.2. The vulnerability is critical as it can lead to a complete takeover of the Salt Master server and all connected minions, posing significant security risks in data centers and cloud environments. Users are strongly advised to update to SaltStack versions 2019.2.4 or 3000.2 and configure security group rules to restrict access to the default listening ports 4505 and 4506.",
