    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management and orchestration tool, specifically affecting the Salt Master service. This vulnerability arises from improper access control in the \"ClearFuncs\" class, allowing unauthenticated users to access certain methods. The flaw allows attackers to read and write arbitrary files on the Salt Master server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and further exploitation. The vulnerability is due to improper path traversal handling, which enables attackers to send specially crafted requests to the Salt Master server, thereby accessing files outside the intended directories without proper authentication. This can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and data breaches. A patch that enhances path verification and sanitization has been released to mitigate this vulnerability.",
