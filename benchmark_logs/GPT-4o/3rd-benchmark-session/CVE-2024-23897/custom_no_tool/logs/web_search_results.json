    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability found in Jenkins, a widely-used open-source automation server. The flaw is specifically located in Jenkins' command line interface (CLI), which utilizes the args4j library to process command-line commands. The vulnerability arises from a feature in the args4j library that automatically replaces an '@' character followed by a file path with the contents of the file. This feature is enabled by default in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, including LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. As a result, attackers with Overall/Read permission can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. Even attackers without such permissions can read the first few lines of files. The exposure of sensitive file contents can lead to remote code execution if attackers access binary secrets or other critical information. The vulnerability can also be exploited through various attack vectors such as Resource Root URLs, \"Remember me\" cookies, cross-site scripting (XSS), and CSRF protection bypass. To mitigate the risk, Jenkins has released updates that disable this feature and recommends disabling CLI access as an immediate workaround.",
