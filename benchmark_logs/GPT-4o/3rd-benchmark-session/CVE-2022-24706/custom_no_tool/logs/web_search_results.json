    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability affecting Apache CouchDB versions 3.2.1 and below. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems without authentication. The issue arises from the improper validation of user input in the CouchDB configuration interface and the use of a default Erlang cookie value 'monster' for authentication between nodes. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted HTTP requests, gaining admin privileges, and potentially full control over the database server. The vulnerability is exacerbated by CouchDB opening a random network port for clustered operations, which is advertised by the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) on a fixed port. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to update to CouchDB version 3.2.2 or later, set a custom Erlang cookie value, and ensure proper firewall configurations to limit exposed ports.",
