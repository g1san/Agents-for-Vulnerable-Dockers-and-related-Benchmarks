CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability identified in OpenSMTPD version 6.6, utilized in OpenBSD 6.6 and various other products. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by sending specially crafted SMTP sessions. The vulnerability can be exploited by including shell metacharacters in the "MAIL FROM" field of an SMTP session. The issue arises due to improper input validation within the `smtp_mailaddr` function in `smtp_session.c`, where an incorrect return value upon validation failure permits the execution of unauthorized commands. This affects the default configuration of OpenSMTPD when it is uncommented.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd][['6.6.0', '6.6.1', '6.6.2']] OpenSMTPD is an open-source implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that is vulnerable in versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.2 due to improper input validation.
- [SOFT][debian][['10.0 (Buster)']] Debian 10.0 (Buster) serves as a compatible operating system environment for the OpenSMTPD service.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The logs indicate that the Debian Buster repositories are no longer available, resulting in a 404 error during the apt-get update process. This causes the build to fail as the package list cannot be retrieved.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we need to update the Dockerfile to use a supported Debian release. Switching from Debian 10 (Buster) to Debian 11 (Bullseye) will likely resolve the repository access issues. Additionally, we need to ensure that the opensmtpd package is available for the new Debian version. If not, we may need to find an alternative source or build it from source.
	Container failure explanation: The logs indicate that the container is missing a hostname configuration. This is evident from the error message 'smtpd: machine does not have a hostname set'. This could lead to issues with services that require a hostname to function correctly, such as SMTP services.Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The error 'smtpd: machine does not have a hostname set' occurs because the container is missing a hostname configuration. This is required for services like SMTP to function correctly. The error suggests that the SMTP service expects the machine to have a hostname set, which is not configured in the current Docker setup.
	- FIX: To fix the error, we need to set a hostname for the container running OpenSMTPD. This can be achieved by adding the 'hostname' key in the Docker Compose file for the OpenSMTPD service. This will ensure that the container has a proper hostname, which is required for the SMTP service to function correctly.
Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' indicates a syntax issue in the YAML file, likely due to incorrect indentation or line breaks.
	- FIX: The error is fixed by correcting the YAML syntax in the docker-compose.yml file. Proper indentation and line breaks are ensured to adhere to YAML formatting rules.
Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The error is due to the Debian Buster repositories being deprecated and no longer available, resulting in a 404 error when attempting to access them.
	- FIX: To fix the error, switch from using the deprecated Debian Buster to Debian Bullseye, which is the next stable release with active repositories. Update the Dockerfile to use 'debian:bullseye-slim' as the base image. This ensures access to the necessary package repositories and allows the installation of OpenSMTPD. Additionally, ensure that the configuration files and Docker Compose setup are compatible with the updated Debian version.
	Container failure explanation: The logs indicate that the container is experiencing an issue related to the SMTP daemon, specifically that the machine does not have a hostname set. This could prevent the SMTP service from functioning correctly, as a proper hostname is often required for email services to operate.Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The container is experiencing an issue related to the SMTP daemon, specifically that the machine does not have a hostname set.
	- FIX: To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the hostname is correctly set within the container at runtime. This can be achieved by explicitly setting the hostname in the Dockerfile using the 'RUN' command to configure the hostname within the container itself. Additionally, ensuring that all necessary configuration files are correctly mapped and available is crucial.
Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The Docker build process fails due to an attempt to modify the /etc/hosts file, which is mounted as read-only in many container environments. This results in the error: '/bin/sh: 1: cannot create /etc/hosts: Read-only file system'.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we will not attempt to modify the /etc/hosts file directly. Instead, we can use the Docker Compose file to set the hostname for the container. This will ensure that the hostname is properly configured without needing to modify system files directly within the container.
	Container failure explanation: The logs indicate that the container is missing a hostname, which is a requirement for certain applications to function properly. The absence of a hostname may lead to issues with services that rely on it, such as SMTP in this case. The debug messages suggest that the container is initializing various components, but the error regarding the hostname is critical and should be addressed for the container to run correctly.Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The container is missing a hostname, which is required for the OpenSMTPD service to function correctly. The absence of a hostname leads to issues with services that rely on it, such as SMTP. The logs indicate that the container is initializing components, but the missing hostname causes a critical error, preventing the container from running properly.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we will set the hostname directly within the Dockerfile using the 'RUN' command to ensure it is configured at build time. This approach will ensure that the hostname is correctly set for the container environment, addressing the critical error related to the missing hostname.
	Container failure explanation: The logs indicate that the container is experiencing an issue due to the machine not having a hostname set. This could prevent certain services within the container from starting or functioning correctly, particularly those that rely on hostname resolution, such as mail servers.Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The container is experiencing an issue due to the machine not having a hostname set. This could prevent certain services within the container from starting or functioning correctly, particularly those that rely on hostname resolution, such as mail servers.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, we will modify the Docker Compose file to include a hostname setting for the container. Additionally, we will ensure that the hostname is properly set at runtime by including a command in the Dockerfile to set it dynamically. This will ensure that the OpenSMTPD service starts correctly and can resolve hostnames as needed.
	Container failure explanation: The container logs indicate that the SMTP daemon (smtpd) is running, but there is a critical warning: "machine does not have a hostname set." This suggests that the container might not be configured correctly, as SMTP services typically require a hostname to function properly. The absence of a hostname could lead to issues with email delivery or other SMTP-related functionalities.Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The container logs indicate that the SMTP daemon (smtpd) is running, but there is a critical warning: "machine does not have a hostname set." This suggests that the container might not be configured correctly, as SMTP services typically require a hostname to function properly. The absence of a hostname could lead to issues with email delivery or other SMTP-related functionalities.
	- FIX: To fix the issue, we will ensure that the hostname is set correctly within the container by using the Dockerfile's ENTRYPOINT to set the hostname before starting the SMTP daemon. This approach ensures that the hostname is properly configured at runtime, addressing the critical warning related to the missing hostname.
	Container failure explanation: The log indicates that the container is encountering an issue because the machine does not have a hostname set. This can prevent certain services, such as SMTP in this context, from functioning correctly. The absence of a hostname can lead to failures in network communication and service initialization.
