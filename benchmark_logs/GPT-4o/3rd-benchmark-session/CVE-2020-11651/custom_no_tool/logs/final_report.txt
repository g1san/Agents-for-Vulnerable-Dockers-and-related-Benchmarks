CVE description: CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, specifically affecting the Salt Master service, which is part of an open-source configuration management and orchestration tool. The vulnerability exists in the ClearFuncs class of the Salt Master component, which listens on TCP ports 4505 and 4506. Due to improper authentication checks, this flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt Master. This can lead to unauthorized access, enabling attackers to retrieve the root key, execute commands on the master and connected minions, and access or modify sensitive files. The vulnerability is present in Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. It is critical as it allows remote code execution without requiring authentication, posing a significant security risk to affected systems.
