    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt software affecting versions prior to 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The issue in the `ClearFuncs` class of the `salt-master` process allows remote attackers to invoke certain methods without authentication, leading to unauthorized access to user tokens and execution of arbitrary commands on `salt-minion` instances. The vulnerability is characterized by low attack complexity and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CVSS base score: 9.8 (critical).",
