CVE description: CVE‑2023‑23752 is an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting Joomla! 4 web content management system versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7. The flaw resides in the public Joomla! API endpoints (such as /api/index.php/v1/config/application and /api/index.php/v1/users) where the access control logic incorrectly treats the requests as public. As a result, any remote unauthenticated attacker can query these endpoints and receive internal configuration data, including the full Joomla! configuration file and a list of Joomla! users. The configuration file contains plaintext MySQL connection details (host, user name, password, database name, table prefix). The disclosed user list includes user IDs, usernames, email addresses and group memberships, exposing Super Users. The information disclosure enables further attacks: the attacker can connect to the exposed MySQL database, change the Super User password, or edit site files to plant a web‑shell, leading to arbitrary code execution as the web‑user. The vulnerability is limited to Joomla! 4 core; earlier Joomla! versions are unaffected. The issue was fixed in Joomla! 4.2.8. Exploitation requires only a simple HTTP request (e.g., using curl) to the vulnerable endpoint; no authentication, cookies, or prior foothold are needed.
