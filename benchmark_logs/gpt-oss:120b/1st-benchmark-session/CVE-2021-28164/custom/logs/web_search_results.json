    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201128164 is a path\u2011traversal and information\u2011disclosure vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server. In Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 through 9.4.38.v20210224, the default compliance mode treats percent\u2011encoded '.' (\"%2e\") and '..' (\"%2e%2e\") as normal path segments instead of normalising them. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a request such as `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` (or using \"%2e%2e\") to bypass the usual protection of the WEB\u2011INF directory and read files such as `web.xml`, configuration files, or other sensitive resources. The vulnerability does not require any credentials and can be triggered simply by sending a malicious HTTP request to a Jetty\u2011served application. The issue is fixed in Jetty 9.4.39+ or can be mitigated by disabling the permissive default compliance mode.",
