CVE description: CVE‑2021‑28164 is a path‑traversal and information‑disclosure vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server. In Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 through 9.4.38.v20210224, the default compliance mode treats percent‑encoded '.' ("%2e") and '..' ("%2e%2e") as normal path segments instead of normalising them. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a request such as `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` (or using "%2e%2e") to bypass the usual protection of the WEB‑INF directory and read files such as `web.xml`, configuration files, or other sensitive resources. The vulnerability does not require any credentials and can be triggered simply by sending a malicious HTTP request to a Jetty‑served application. The issue is fixed in Jetty 9.4.39+ or can be mitigated by disabling the permissive default compliance mode.
Attack Type: information disclosure
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetty][['9.4.37.v20210219', '9.4.38.v20210224']] Vulnerable Jetty servlet container that contains the path‑traversal flaw. The official Jetty Docker image runs the Jetty server and includes a sample web application, providing a testable environment for the CVE.

	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition only includes a MySQL 5.7 service and a custom Node.js application based on node:12-alpine. No Jetty service is defined or used in the docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, or any of the inspected images. Consequently, the required Jetty service is missing, and there is no version to compare against the vulnerable Jetty versions list. Both the 'services_ok' and 'code_hard_version' milestones are therefore not met.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition only includes a MySQL 5.7 service and a custom Node.js application based on node:12-alpine. No Jetty service is defined or used in the docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, or any of the inspected images. Consequently, the required Jetty service is missing, and there is no version to compare against the vulnerable Jetty versions list. Both the 'services_ok' and 'code_hard_version' milestones are therefore not met.
	- FIX: Add a Jetty container to the compose file, pin a safe version, and link it to your app:

1. Choose a non‑vulnerable Jetty release (e.g., 9.4.53‑v20230823). Verify it’s not on any CVE list you track.
2. Create a Dockerfile for Jetty (or use the official image):
   ```
   FROM eclipse/jetty:9.4.53-jre11
   COPY your‑webapp.war /var/lib/jetty/webapps/
   ```
3. Add the service to docker‑compose.yml:
   ```
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     mysql:
       image: mysql:5.7
       …
     app:
       build: ./app
       …
     jetty:
       build: ./jetty
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
       depends_on:
         - app
   ```
4. Rebuild and redeploy:
   ```
   docker compose build
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Now the Jetty service exists, runs a known‑good version, and the “services_ok” and “code_hard_version” milestones are satisfied.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build logs to see the exact error line. Typical fixes:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (no stray characters, correct FROM line, proper instruction order).  
2. Ensure the base image name and tag exist and can be pulled; try docker pull <image>:<tag> manually.  
3. If a RUN step fails, run the same command locally in a container to see missing dependencies or permission issues; add necessary apt‑get install or apk commands.  
4. Clean the build cache and rebuild: docker builder prune then docker build --no-cache -t myimage .  
5. Look for file‑path problems – COPY/ADD sources must exist relative to the Dockerfile context. Adjust paths or .dockerignore accordingly.  
6. If the error is “permission denied” on a file or directory, add appropriate USER or chmod/chown commands in the Dockerfile.  

Apply the relevant change and rerun the build. If the error persists, paste the exact error message for deeper analysis.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker Compose file includes a Jetty service, so the required service is present. However, the Jetty image used is 'jetty:9.4.53-jre11' (JETTY_VERSION=9.4.53.v20231009), which does not match any of the specified vulnerable versions ['9.4.37.v20210219', '9.4.38.v20210224']. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met.
	- ERROR: The Docker Compose file includes a Jetty service, so the required service is present. However, the Jetty image used is 'jetty:9.4.53-jre11' (JETTY_VERSION=9.4.53.v20231009), which does not match any of the specified vulnerable versions ['9.4.37.v20210219', '9.4.38.v20210224']. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met.
	- FIX: Update the Jetty service in the compose file to use a vulnerable tag that matches the required versions, e.g.:

services:
  jetty:
    image: jetty:9.4.38.v20210224‑jre11   # or 9.4.37.v20210219‑jre11
    ...

Then run `docker compose up -d` so the container runs the exact version listed in the vulnerability list. This satisfies the `code_hard_version` milestone.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors, missing files, or wrong paths. Verify the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled (run docker pull for it). Ensure any required build‑time dependencies are installed (apt‑get update && apt‑get install …) and that network access isn’t blocked. Clear the cache and rebuild to see a clean error log: docker build --no-cache -t myimage . Then address the specific error shown (e.g., fix a misspelled command or add missing files). Once the Dockerfile builds without errors, the container will run normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to see the exact error line. Typical fixes:

1. **Dockerfile syntax** – ensure each instruction is correctly written (e.g., `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y …` on one line, proper escaping with `\`).
2. **Base image** – verify the image name and tag exist and are compatible with your commands; pull the latest version (`docker pull <base>`).
3. **Missing packages/files** – add any required `apt-get update` or `apk update` before installing, and confirm file paths exist before `COPY`/`ADD`.
4. **Cache issues** – clear the build cache (`docker builder prune`) or build with `--no-cache` to force fresh steps.
5. **Permissions** – run commands needing root as `root` or use `USER` appropriately; add `RUN chmod +x` if executing scripts.
6. **Network** – if the error is a download failure, check proxy/DNS settings or add `--network=host` temporarily.

Apply the relevant change, then rebuild: `docker build -t myimage .` (add `--no-cache` if you cleared the cache). The build should complete once the offending step is corrected.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Jetty service maps the internal port 8080 to external port 8082 ("8082:8080"), which deviates from its default network port 8080. Therefore, not all services are using their default network ports.
	- ERROR: The Jetty service maps the internal port 8080 to external port 8082 ("8082:8080"), which deviates from its default network port 8080. Therefore, not all services are using their default network ports.
	- FIX: Change the Docker port mapping to use the default port: update the service definition to “8080:8080”, then restart the container so Jetty is exposed on its standard port. Adjust any dependent configurations accordingly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The 'app' service, which runs the vulnerable Node.js application on port 8080, does not have an external port mapping defined in the docker-compose.yml. While the MySQL ('db') and Jetty ('jetty') services correctly map their default ports (3306 and 8080 respectively), the missing port exposure for the app means it is not reachable from the host or external network, violating the requirement that all services be accessible on their default network ports.
	- ERROR: The 'app' service, which runs the vulnerable Node.js application on port 8080, does not have an external port mapping defined in the docker-compose.yml. While the MySQL ('db') and Jetty ('jetty') services correctly map their default ports (3306 and 8080 respectively), the missing port exposure for the app means it is not reachable from the host or external network, violating the requirement that all services be accessible on their default network ports.
	- FIX: Add a ports section to the app service in docker‑compose.yml, e.g.:

services:
  app:
    # …other config…
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

Then run docker‑compose up again so the Node.js app is reachable on host port 8080.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: First check the Docker build output to identify the exact error line. Common fixes:

1. **Syntax errors in Dockerfile** – ensure each instruction is correctly spelled (e.g., `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`) and that line continuations use `\` with no stray characters.

2. **Missing files** – verify that any files referenced by `COPY`/`ADD` exist in the build context directory and the paths are correct.

3. **Invalid base image** – confirm the `FROM` image tag exists and can be pulled (run `docker pull <image>` manually).

4. **Permission problems** – if a `RUN` step accesses protected resources, add `USER root` before the step or adjust file permissions with `chmod`.

5. **Failed package install** – for `apt-get`, `yum`, etc., add `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …` and clean up caches; for network issues, try `--network=host` or a reliable mirror.

6. **Cache issues** – force a fresh build with `docker build --no-cache .` to discard stale layers.

After adjusting the Dockerfile based on the identified cause, run `docker build .` again. If the error persists, paste the specific error message for targeted assistance.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build logs to see the exact error line, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (no stray characters, proper FROM image, correct spacing).
2. Make sure the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled (docker pull <image>:<tag>).
3. Ensure all file paths used in COPY/ADD exist in the build context.
4. Confirm each RUN command succeeds – break complex RUN lines into separate steps and test them manually in a container.
5. Clean the build cache (docker builder prune) or rebuild with --no-cache to rule out corrupted layers.
6. If a specific package install fails, update the package index first (e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install …) and pin versions if needed.
7. After fixing the offending step, run docker build again.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The 'app' service maps the container's internal port 8080 to host port 3000 ("3000:8080"), which is not the default port for the application. While the other services (db on 3306 and jetty on 8080) use their standard ports, the non‑default host mapping for the app causes the network_setup milestone to fail.Docker Scout says that a Docker Image is vulnerable to CVE-2021-28164!
