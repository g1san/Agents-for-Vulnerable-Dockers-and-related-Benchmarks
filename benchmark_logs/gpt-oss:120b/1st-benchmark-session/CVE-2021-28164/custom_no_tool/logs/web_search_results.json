    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read files located inside the protected WEB-INF directory. The flaw originates from Jetty's handling of encoded path segments in its default compliance mode. When a request contains encoded dot (\"%2e\" or \"%u002e\") or encoded null characters (\"%00\"), Jetty normalizes the path before decoding it. This ordering permits the request to bypass security checks, and after decoding the path resolves to a location such as /WEB-INF/web.xml. The server then serves the file as an alias, leaking configuration files, source code, or other sensitive information. No privileged credentials or user interaction are required; the attacker only needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Jetty instance. The vulnerability is classified as an information\u2011disclosure flaw with a CVSS base score of 5.3 (Medium).",
