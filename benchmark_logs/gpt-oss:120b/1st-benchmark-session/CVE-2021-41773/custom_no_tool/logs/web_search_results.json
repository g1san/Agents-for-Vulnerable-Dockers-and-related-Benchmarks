    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201141773 is a critical path\u2011traversal and remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. The flaw originates from an incorrect implementation of the URL path normalisation routine in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. After URL\u2011decoding, the routine only removes the first \"..\" sequence, allowing an attacker to craft URLs containing encoded traversal sequences such as \"..%2f\", \".%2e/\" or similar variations. When the server\u2019s root directory (<Directory />) or a CGI\u2011bin alias is configured with \"Require all granted\" (the default in many installations), the malformed path bypasses the document\u2011root restriction and the server will serve files from anywhere on the filesystem, including sensitive files like /etc/passwd, SSH private keys, or configuration files. If the mod_cgi module is enabled, the same bypass can be used to reach the cgi-bin directory, invoke a CGI script, and execute arbitrary commands, leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability was partially addressed in Apache 2.4.50 but the fix was incomplete; the issue remains exploitable in both 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 and was fully remediated only in Apache 2.4.51. No additional modules or external services are required to exploit the flaw; a simple HTTP GET request with a crafted path is sufficient to retrieve files or, when CGI is enabled, to achieve remote code execution.",
