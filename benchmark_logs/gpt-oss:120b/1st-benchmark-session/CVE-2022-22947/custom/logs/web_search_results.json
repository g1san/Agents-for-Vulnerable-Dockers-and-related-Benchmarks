    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201122947 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway. When the Actuator gateway routes endpoint is enabled, exposed to the network and not protected by authentication, the gateway accepts user\u2011supplied route definitions that are evaluated using Spring Expression Language (SpEL). An attacker can craft a route definition containing a malicious SpEL expression that is executed by the gateway process, allowing arbitrary operating\u2011system commands to run with the privileges of the Java process. The flaw exists in all Spring Cloud Gateway releases prior to the security patches and can be triggered without any authentication, leading to full compromise of the host.",
