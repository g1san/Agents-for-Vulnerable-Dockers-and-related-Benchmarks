    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt master service. The vulnerability resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the salt-master process in Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000 versions prior to 3000.2. The master accepts unauthenticated requests over its Zero\u2011MQ (port 4506) or REST API interface and fails to properly validate method calls. An attacker who can reach the master can retrieve the master\u2019s root AES authentication key, read or write arbitrary files on the master, execute arbitrary commands on the master itself, and broadcast commands to all connected minions. This results in full remote code execution and complete compromise of the Salt infrastructure and any managed systems.",
