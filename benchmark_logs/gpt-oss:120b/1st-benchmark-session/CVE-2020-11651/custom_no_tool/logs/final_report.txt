----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11651 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt master service. The flaw resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the salt‑master process, which fails to properly validate method calls that are exposed through the ZeroMQ RPC interface (default TCP port 4506). As a result, an unauthenticated attacker who can reach the master’s ZeroMQ port can invoke privileged Salt functions such as `wheel.key`, `jobs`, and file manipulation APIs. By retrieving the master’s private root key, the attacker gains full control over the master and can:
1. Execute arbitrary shell commands on the master itself.
2. Run commands on every connected minion, effectively compromising the entire managed infrastructure.
3. Read or write arbitrary files on the master, including sensitive credential stores like `/etc/shadow`.
4. Upload malicious payloads or schedule cron jobs for persistence.
The exploitation flow demonstrated by publicly available proof‑of‑concept scripts is:
• Connect to the master’s ZeroMQ endpoint.
• Issue a `wheel.key` request to obtain the base‑64 encoded root key.
• Use the retrieved key to authenticate subsequent RPC calls and invoke `salt-run` or `salt '*'` commands.
This vulnerability affects all Salt master versions prior to the security updates released on 2020‑12‑03. The vulnerable releases are the 2019.2 series up to 2019.2.3 and the Salt 3000 series up to 3000.1. After the fix (Salt 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000.2) proper authentication checks were added to the `ClearFuncs` methods, preventing unauthenticated access.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The Salt master container provides the vulnerable SaltStack Salt service. Versions listed are those that contain the ClearFuncs validation bug and allow unauthenticated access to the wheel.key and other privileged RPC functions, making the Docker system exploitable for CVE‑2020‑11651.
- [SOFT-DOCKER][docker][['20.10.24']] Docker engine required to run the Salt master container. Any recent version compatible with the listed Salt images is sufficient.

	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Check the container’s status, view its logs, and inspect its settings:

1. List containers and see which one is stopped: `docker ps -a`.
2. Show recent logs for the problematic container: `docker logs <container_name_or_id>`.
3. Look for error messages that indicate missing files, permission issues, or crashed processes.
4. Verify the container’s configuration: `docker inspect <container_name_or_id>` – check mounted volumes, environment variables, and command entrypoint.
5. If the issue is a transient failure, try restarting it: `docker restart <container_name_or_id>`.
6. If logs reveal a missing dependency or crash, update the Dockerfile or compose file, rebuild the image (`docker build -t <image_name> .`), and redeploy (`docker run` or `docker-compose up -d`).
7. For persistent failures, remove the container and recreate it from a known‑good image: `docker rm <container_name_or_id>` then `docker run ...` or `docker-compose up -d`.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container logs show a fatal error: '/entrypoint.sh: line 5: /dockerd-entrypoint.sh: not found'. This means the expected entrypoint script cannot be located, so the Docker-in-Docker service cannot start correctly despite the container state reporting 'running'. The missing dockerd-entrypoint.sh prevents the container from operating as intended.
	- ERROR: The container logs show a fatal error: '/entrypoint.sh: line 5: /dockerd-entrypoint.sh: not found'. This means the expected entrypoint script cannot be located, so the Docker-in-Docker service cannot start correctly despite the container state reporting 'running'. The missing dockerd-entrypoint.sh prevents the container from operating as intended.
	- FIX: 1. Open the Dockerfile (or the image you’re extending) and verify the location where dockerd‑entrypoint.sh is added. It should be copied into the filesystem, e.g.:  
   `COPY dockerd-entrypoint.sh /`  

2. Make sure the file actually exists in the build context at the same path you reference. If it’s missing, add it or fetch it from the proper source.

3. Ensure the script is executable:  
   `RUN chmod +x /dockerd-entrypoint.sh`

4. If the script lives in a sub‑directory, adjust the entrypoint to point to the correct absolute path, e.g.:  
   `ENTRYPOINT ["/path/to/dockerd-entrypoint.sh"]`  
   or modify /entrypoint.sh to call the correct path.

5. Rebuild the image and run the container again:  
   `docker build -t my‑dind .`  
   `docker run --privileged my‑dind`

After confirming the script is present and executable, the container should start the Docker daemon normally.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup only uses the Docker image (docker:19.03.5-dind). No saltstack/salt image is referenced in the Dockerfile, compose file, or entrypoint script, so the required service list ['saltstack/salt', 'docker'] is not fully satisfied, causing services_ok to be false. Additionally, the only version-controlled service present is Docker 19.03.5, which is not part of the vulnerable version list for the 'HARD' service (saltstack/salt). Since no vulnerable version of saltstack/salt is used, the code_hard_version milestone is also false.

Since no vulnerable version of saltstack/salt is used, the code_hard_version milestone is also false.
	- FIX: Add a saltstack/salt container to the stack (e.g., in docker‑compose.yml) with the exact version that appears in the vulnerable‑version list for the HARD milestone. Then update the service‑list definition so it includes both “saltstack/salt” and “docker”. If you need the salt service inside the dind container, install the appropriate salt package (matching the vulnerable version) in the Dockerfile based on the same base image, or create a separate saltstack/salt image and link it via depends_on. After adding the salt service and confirming its version, services_ok and code_hard_version will both evaluate to true.
