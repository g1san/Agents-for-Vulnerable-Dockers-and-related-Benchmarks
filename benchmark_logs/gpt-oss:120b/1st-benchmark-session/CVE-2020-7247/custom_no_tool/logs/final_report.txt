CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a command injection vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The daemon fails to properly escape dangerous characters in user‑controlled SMTP commands, specifically in the \`MAIL FROM\` address parsing. An attacker can send a crafted SMTP request containing shell metacharacters, which are later passed to the system shell without sufficient sanitisation. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the OpenSMTPD process, typically root, resulting in full remote code execution on the affected host. The flaw affects OpenSMTPD versions released before 6.6.2 and has been observed on OpenBSD releases 5.9, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd/opensmtpd][['5.9', '6.4', '6.5', '6.6.0', '6.6.1']] Vulnerable OpenSMTPD daemon providing the SMTP service that contains the command‑injection flaw exploited by CVE-2020-7247.
- [SOFT][docker][['20.10.24']] Docker Engine required to run the OpenSMTPD container and create the testable Docker environment.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run the build with detailed output to see the exact error: docker build -t myimage . (or add --progress=plain if using BuildKit).  
2. Verify the Dockerfile syntax – common issues are missing “\” line continuations, wrong instruction order, or unsupported commands for the chosen base image.  
3. Make sure the base image exists and is accessible (pull it manually first: docker pull <base‑image>).  
4. Check any COPY/ADD source paths – they must be relative to the build context and the files must have read permission.  
5. If the error is about a missing package or binary, update the package index inside the Dockerfile (e.g., RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y <pkg>) and ensure the correct package name for the base distro.  
6. Clear any corrupted build cache: docker builder prune or rebuild with --no-cache.  
7. For permission‑related failures, add a non‑root user or adjust file ownership (e.g., RUN chown -R node:node /app).  
8. After fixing the identified issue, rerun the build. If it still fails, repeat steps 1‑7 focusing on the new error message.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose configuration defines only two services: 'web' based on python:3.8-slim and 'db' based on mysql:5.7. No service uses the 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' image, so the check for vulnerable versions of that service is not satisfied, resulting in code_hard_version = false. Moreover, the required services list ['opensmtpd/opensmtpd', 'docker'] is not present in the compose file—there is no 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' image and no service named 'docker'—so services_ok = false.
	- ERROR: The compose configuration defines only two services: 'web' based on python:3.8-slim and 'db' based on mysql:5.7. No service uses the 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' image, so the check for vulnerable versions of that service is not satisfied, resulting in code_hard_version = false. Moreover, the required services list ['opensmtpd/opensmtpd', 'docker'] is not present in the compose file—there is no 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' image and no service named 'docker'—so services_ok = false.
	- FIX: Add the missing services to the compose file. For example, add an opensmtpd service using the opensmtpd/opensmtpd image (specify a non‑vulnerable tag) and add a docker service (or rename an existing service) that uses the desired docker image. Then update the required‑services list or remove entries that you don’t need. This will make services_ok true and, with a safe opensmtpd tag, code_hard_version will also become true.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Docker build output to locate the failing line, then:

1. Verify the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled.
2. Ensure all RUN, COPY, and ADD commands use correct syntax and valid paths.
3. Confirm any required files are present in the build context (same directory as the Dockerfile).
4. If a package install fails, add `apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>` (or the appropriate package manager) in a single RUN layer.
5. Look for missing environment variables or build‑args; add them with `--build-arg` or `ARG` in the Dockerfile.
6. Clean up leftover caches: run `docker builder prune` and rebuild.

Apply the fix, then re‑run `docker build`. This usually resolves the termination error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to see the exact error line, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (correct FROM, RUN, COPY paths, proper line continuations).
2. Ensure the base image tag exists and is reachable (pull it manually with docker pull to test).
3. Confirm all files referenced by COPY/ADD are present in the build context and have the right permissions.
4. If you’re hitting a cache‑related issue, rebuild without cache: docker build --no-cache -t myimage .
5. Fix any failing RUN commands (missing packages, incorrect apt‑get syntax, missing dependencies) by updating the command or adding needed installs.
6. After correcting the Dockerfile or context, run the build again.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Check the status → docker ps -a and note the container’s state.  
If it’s “Exited”, view why → docker logs <container>.  
Common causes: crash in the entrypoint, missing files, wrong env vars, port conflict, out‑of‑memory.  

Fix steps:  
1. Inspect configuration → docker inspect <container> (look for Cmd, Env, Mounts).  
2. Correct the Dockerfile or compose overrides (paths, ENV, ports).  
3. Rebuild if needed → docker build -t <image> . (or docker compose build).  
4. Remove the broken instance → docker rm <container>.  
5. Start a fresh one → docker run … (or docker compose up -d).  

If it still fails, repeat the logs check and adjust the failing command or resource limits.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: 1. Run `docker ps -a` to identify the container’s name or ID and its status.  
2. Check the container logs: `docker logs <container>` to see error messages.  
3. If the logs show a clear issue (e.g., missing file, permission error), correct the underlying cause (adjust volumes, fix config, etc.).  
4. Restart the container: `docker restart <container>`.  
5. If it still fails, inspect details: `docker inspect <container>` and look for abnormal exit codes or health‑check failures.  
6. Recreate the container with updated settings if necessary:  
   - Stop and remove: `docker rm -f <container>`  
   - Pull latest image (if needed): `docker pull <image>`  
   - Run again with the proper `docker run` options.  

After these steps the container should start normally. If problems persist, repeat the log inspection to target the specific failure.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line that triggers the failure, then:

1. Read the exact error message from the build output – it points to the problematic instruction.
2. Verify syntax (e.g., proper quoting, correct Dockerfile directives, no stray spaces).
3. Make sure all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources, scripts, binaries) exist in the build context and have correct permissions.
4. If a RUN command fails:
   • Run the same commands manually in a temporary container (`docker run -it --rm <base-image> /bin/sh`) to see the missing dependencies or environment issues.
   • Install required packages before using them, and clean apt caches (`apt-get update && apt-get install -y … && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`).
5. If a version conflict appears, pin compatible versions of the base image and packages.
6. After fixing the cause, rebuild with `docker build --no-cache .` to ensure changes are applied.

Repeat until the build finishes without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or invalid commands, then rebuild with a clean cache.

1. **Inspect the Dockerfile**  
   - Verify each instruction (FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.) is correctly written.  
   - Ensure paths in COPY/ADD exist and are relative to the build context.  
   - Confirm any environment variables used are defined.

2. **Validate the base image**  
   - Make sure the image name/tag in the `FROM` line is correct and available (`docker pull <image>`).  

3. **Update package commands**  
   - If using package managers (apt, yum, apk), add `&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` (or the equivalent) to keep layers clean.  
   - Use `apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>` in a single RUN line to avoid stale caches.

4. **Clear the build cache**  
   - Run `docker builder prune` (or `docker system prune -f`) to remove old intermediate images that might be corrupted.  

5. **Re‑run the build with verbose output**  
   - `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .`  
   - Review the output for the exact step that fails; address the reported issue (missing file, permission, syntax, etc.).

6. **Common fixes**  
   - **Missing file**: Add the file to the build context or correct the path.  
   - **Permission denied**: Use `USER root` temporarily for the failing step, or adjust file permissions with `chmod`.  
   - **Network/URL errors**: Verify internet connectivity, proxy settings, or replace dead URLs.  

After correcting the identified problem, run the build again. If it still fails, capture the specific error line and investigate that command directly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run the build with full logs: docker build -t myimage . and note the exact error line.  
2. Verify Dockerfile syntax at the reported line (misspelled instruction, wrong escape character, missing backslash).  
3. Ensure all referenced files/folders exist in the build context and have read permission for the Docker daemon.  
4. Check the base image tag; pull the latest version (docker pull <base>) or use a specific stable tag.  
5. If the error is from a RUN command, break it into separate steps to isolate the failing command, and add &&\ line‑continuations for clarity.  
6. Clean the cache and rebuild: docker builder prune then docker build --no-cache -t myimage .  
7. Update Docker Engine to the latest stable release; older versions can mis‑interpret newer Dockerfile features.  
8. If the problem persists, copy the failing RUN command into an interactive container (docker run -it <base> /bin/sh) to debug manually, then adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
