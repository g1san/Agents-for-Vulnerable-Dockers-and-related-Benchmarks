    "desc": "CVE-2020-7247 is a command injection vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The daemon fails to properly escape dangerous characters in user\u2011controlled SMTP commands, specifically in the \\`MAIL FROM\\` address parsing. An attacker can send a crafted SMTP request containing shell metacharacters, which are later passed to the system shell without sufficient sanitisation. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the OpenSMTPD process, typically root, resulting in full remote code execution on the affected host. The flaw affects OpenSMTPD versions released before 6.6.2 and has been observed on OpenBSD releases 5.9, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6.",
