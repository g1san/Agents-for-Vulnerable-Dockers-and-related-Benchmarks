CVE description: CVE‑2012‑1823 is an argument‑injection vulnerability in the PHP CGI binary (php‑cgi). When PHP is executed as a CGI script, the code that builds the command‑line argument vector from the HTTP QUERY_STRING fails to ignore options if the query string does not contain an '=' character. An attacker can therefore place arbitrary PHP command‑line switches (for example ‑d allow_url_include=On or ‑d auto_prepend_file=php://input) directly in the URL. The injected switches are processed by php‑cgi as if they were given on the command line, which allows the attacker to control PHP configuration and to include and execute attacker‑controlled code. This results in unauthenticated remote code execution with the privileges of the web‑server process. The flaw affects PHP versions prior to 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4.x prior to 5.4.2, and is particularly exploitable on Windows systems where a soft‑hyphen character (%ad) is converted to a normal hyphen, bypassing the original fix. Exploitation can be performed with a simple crafted HTTP request, using tools such as curl, lwp‑request, Metasploit’s exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection, or custom scripts that send the malicious query string. No additional services are required beyond a web server that forwards requests to the vulnerable php‑cgi binary.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.3.11', '5.4.0', '5.4.1']] Provides the vulnerable php‑cgi binary. These specific PHP versions contain the argument‑injection flaw in sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c that allows injection of arbitrary -d options via the query string, leading to remote code execution.
- [SOFT-WEB][httpd][['2.4']] Acts as the web server that receives HTTP requests and invokes the php‑cgi binary. Required to make the Docker container serve web traffic and expose the vulnerable PHP CGI endpoint.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build output to locate the exact error line, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax around that line (correct FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.).
2. Ensure any files or directories referenced by COPY/ADD actually exist in the build context and have proper permissions.
3. If the error is from a RUN command, run the same command manually in a temporary container to see detailed output and adjust the command (e.g., install packages, set env vars, clean caches).
4. Look for missing dependencies or version conflicts; add required apt‑get/yum install steps before using the tool.
5. If network access fails, confirm DNS/registry connectivity or add `--network=host` / appropriate proxy settings.
6. Clear the Docker build cache (`docker builder prune` or `docker build --no-cache`) to rule out stale layers.
7. Rebuild the image after each fix to confirm the error is resolved.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Look at the build output to see the exact error line.  
2. Verify the Dockerfile syntax around that line (misspelled instruction, wrong spacing, missing backslash).  
3. Check that all referenced files (COPY/ADD source) exist and have read permission.  
4. Ensure the base image name and tag are correct and available.  
5. If the error is due to a stale layer, rebuild without cache: `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .`  
6. For permission‑related failures, add a `USER root` step before the offending command or adjust file permissions in the image.  
7. If the problem persists, simplify the Dockerfile to isolate the failing instruction, fix it, then re‑add the remaining steps.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs php5‑cgi from Ubuntu 14.04 repositories, which provides PHP version 5.5.9 (the Trusty package). This version is not in the vulnerable list ['5.3.11', '5.4.0', '5.4.1'], so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The image does include both PHP (php5‑cgi) and an HTTP server (apache2), satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile installs php5‑cgi from Ubuntu 14.04 repositories, which provides PHP version 5.5.9 (the Trusty package). This version is not in the vulnerable list ['5.3.11', '5.4.0', '5.4.1'], so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The image does include both PHP (php5‑cgi) and an HTTP server (apache2), satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: Update the Dockerfile to use a newer Ubuntu release (e.g., 20.04) or a PHP‑specific base image that provides PHP 7.x+. Replace the `apt-get install php5-cgi` line with the appropriate package name for the newer version (e.g., `apt-get install php7.4-cgi` or `php8.2-cgi`). If staying on Ubuntu 14.04, add a trusted PPA that supplies a non‑vulnerable PHP version and install from there. Rebuild the image so the installed PHP version no longer matches the vulnerable list.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build logs to locate the exact error line. Then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax around the failing instruction (missing backslash, wrong ARG, misplaced RUN).
2. Ensure the base image name and tag exist and can be pulled.
3. Confirm all package names in apt/yum/pip commands are correct and the repositories are reachable.
4. If a layer is corrupted, run the build with docker build --no-cache to force a fresh rebuild.
5. Clean any dangling images/containers: docker system prune -f, then retry the build.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Docker build output to see the exact error line, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (e.g., correct FROM, proper continuation “\” and quoting).  
2. Make sure every file referenced by COPY/ADD exists in the build context and has proper read permissions.  
3. If the error is “command not found” or “permission denied”, add the needed packages or run the command with the appropriate user (use `USER root` temporarily or `RUN chmod +x …`).  
4. For failed package installs, update the package list first (`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y …`) and clean caches at the end to keep the image small.  
5. Clear any cached layers that may be corrupted: `docker builder prune` then rebuild with `docker build --no-cache`.  

Apply the specific fix indicated by the error message and rerun `docker build`.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The image is built from php:5.6-apache, which provides PHP version 5.6.40 (as shown by the PHP_VERSION environment variable). The required vulnerable versions are 5.3.11, 5.4.0, and 5.4.1, none of which match the version used. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The Dockerfile includes both PHP and Apache (httpd) via the php:5.6-apache base image, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- ERROR: The image is built from php:5.6-apache, which provides PHP version 5.6.40 (as shown by the PHP_VERSION environment variable). The required vulnerable versions are 5.3.11, 5.4.0, and 5.4.1, none of which match the version used. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The Dockerfile includes both PHP and Apache (httpd) via the php:5.6-apache base image, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: Swap the base image for one that uses a vulnerable PHP version, e.g.:

FROM php:5.4.0-apache   # or php:5.3.11‑apache if you need that exact release
# keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged

If the exact vulnerable release isn’t available as an official tag, install the required PHP source manually (download 5.4.0/5.4.1, compile, and replace the binary) while preserving the Apache layer already present in the php:*‑apache images. This will satisfy the `code_hard_version` milestone and still meet `services_ok`.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then run a clean build:

1. Inspect the Dockerfile line indicated in the error; correct any malformed commands (e.g., missing backslashes, wrong instruction order).
2. Verify that all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) exist in the build context and have correct permissions.
3. Remove any stale cache that might cause conflicts:
```bash
docker builder prune -f
docker build --no-cache -t myimage:latest .
```
4. If the error is from a specific RUN step, execute that command manually inside a temporary container to see more detail:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/sh baseimage
# then run the failing command
```
5. Adjust the failing command (e.g., install packages, paths) based on the manual test, then rebuild.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors (misspelled commands, wrong line continuations). Verify that every referenced file or directory exists in the build context and has correct permissions. Make sure the base image name and tag are valid and can be pulled (run docker pull to test). If you use network resources (apt, curl, etc.), ensure they are reachable and add --network=host or proper proxy settings. Clear the build cache (docker builder prune) and rebuild. Adjust any RUN steps that assume interactive shells (add ‑y or non‑interactive flags). If the error persists, run the build with --progress=plain to see the exact failure line and fix that specific command.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build logs to see the exact error, then:

1. Verify Dockerfile syntax (correct FROM, RUN, COPY paths).
2. Ensure all referenced files exist in the build context.
3. Confirm required packages are available and version‑compatible.
4. Add --no‑cache to force a clean build if layer caching is corrupt.
5. If a specific RUN command fails, run it manually in a temporary container to debug.
6. Update or pin base‑image tags to a known good version.
7. Re‑run the build after fixing the identified issue.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
