    "desc": "CVE\u20112012\u20111823 is an argument\u2011injection vulnerability in the PHP CGI binary (php\u2011cgi). When PHP is executed as a CGI script, the code that builds the command\u2011line argument vector from the HTTP QUERY_STRING fails to ignore options if the query string does not contain an '=' character. An attacker can therefore place arbitrary PHP command\u2011line switches (for example \u2011d allow_url_include=On or \u2011d auto_prepend_file=php://input) directly in the URL. The injected switches are processed by php\u2011cgi as if they were given on the command line, which allows the attacker to control PHP configuration and to include and execute attacker\u2011controlled code. This results in unauthenticated remote code execution with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. The flaw affects PHP versions prior to 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4.x prior to 5.4.2, and is particularly exploitable on Windows systems where a soft\u2011hyphen character (%ad) is converted to a normal hyphen, bypassing the original fix. Exploitation can be performed with a simple crafted HTTP request, using tools such as curl, lwp\u2011request, Metasploit\u2019s exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection, or custom scripts that send the malicious query string. No additional services are required beyond a web server that forwards requests to the vulnerable php\u2011cgi binary.",
