CVE description: CVE-2012-1823 is an argument‑injection vulnerability in the PHP CGI binary (php‑cgi). When PHP is executed as a CGI program, the code that parses the query string fails to skip option parsing for the `-d` switch if the query string does not contain an unescaped ‘=’ character. An attacker can therefore inject arbitrary command‑line options or PHP configuration directives directly in the URL (for example `?-dallow_url_include=On -dauto_prepend_file=php://input`). By using these injected options the attacker can force PHP to include attacker‑supplied code from the request body and achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the web‑server process. The flaw also allows source‑code disclosure by using the `-s` option. The vulnerability affects specific older releases of PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 that are built for the CGI SAPI.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.3.0', '5.3.1', '5.3.2', '5.3.3', '5.3.4', '5.3.5', '5.3.6', '5.3.7', '5.3.8', '5.3.9', '5.3.10', '5.3.11', '5.4.0', '5.4.1']] PHP CGI binary (php‑cgi) that contains the vulnerable query‑string parsing logic. This service must be exposed through a web server for the vulnerability to be reachable.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.25.3']] Web server that forwards HTTP requests to the PHP CGI binary. It provides the necessary HTTP front‑end for the vulnerable PHP‑CGI process.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run the build with full output to see the exact error:  
   `docker build --no‑cache -t myimage .`

2. Identify the failing step in the Dockerfile from the log.

3. Common fixes:  
   • **Syntax errors** – ensure each instruction is correctly spelled and formatted.  
   • **Missing files** – verify that `COPY`/`ADD` source paths exist relative to the build context.  
   • **Package install failures** – add `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …` in the same RUN line, and include `--no-install-recommends` if needed.  
   • **Permissions** – run commands that need root as `USER root` or use `sudo` where appropriate.  
   • **Network issues** – add `--network=host` or configure proxy variables if the build can’t reach external repos.

4. Apply the fix, then rebuild:  
   `docker build -t myimage .`

If the error persists, share the exact log line for more targeted advice.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then rebuild with diagnostics:

1. Run a dry‑run build to see the exact failing step:  
  docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t test .  

2. If the error is “failed to fetch” or “cannot locate …”, verify that all URLs, package names and file paths are correct and that the build host has internet access.

3. If a RUN step fails, exec the same commands interactively in a temporary container to see the real output:  
  docker run -it --rm <base‑image> /bin/sh  

4. Fix the problematic command (e.g., update package manager caches, correct apt‑get syntax, add missing dependencies).

5. After correcting the Dockerfile, rebuild cleanly:  
  docker build -t <image‑name> .  

If the failure persists, share the exact error line for a more targeted fix.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to see the exact error line, then:

1. Verify Dockerfile syntax (missing `\` line‑breaks, incorrect instruction order, wrong base image name).
2. Ensure all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) exist relative to the build context.
3. Confirm required packages/keys are reachable (add `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y …` or use proper proxy settings).
4. If the error is “layer already exists” or “cache conflict,” rebuild without cache: `docker build --no‑cache -t myimage .`
5. For permission‑related failures, add appropriate `USER` or `RUN chmod` steps, or run the build as a user with sufficient rights.
6. Clean up dangling images/volumes that might be causing space issues: `docker system prune -f`.

Apply the specific fix indicated by the log, then re‑run the build.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Inspect the build output to see the exact error line. Typical fixes:

1. **Syntax/typo** – verify each Dockerfile command (FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.) and correct any misspellings or missing backslashes.
2. **Missing files** – ensure all files referenced by COPY/ADD exist in the build context directory.
3. **Permissions** – make sure the Docker daemon can read the source files and that any RUN commands have proper user rights.
4. **Package manager errors** – if a RUN step fails (apt‑get, yum, pip, …), add `&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` or update the repo indexes, and consider adding `--no-cache` to force a clean install.
5. **Layer size** – if the image runs out of space, increase Docker’s storage driver limits or clean up temporary files in the same RUN step.

Apply the needed change, then rebuild with `docker build .` (add `--no-cache` if you want to be sure old layers aren’t reused).


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run `docker build -t myimage .` to see the exact error line.  
2. If the error is “cannot locate Dockerfile” – ensure the file is named **Dockerfile** and you are in the correct directory.  
3. If it’s a “missing package” or “apt‑get failed” – add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>` and verify network access (use `--network=host` to test).  
4. If the base image can’t be pulled – check the image name/tag, add `docker login` for private registries, or replace with a valid public image.  
5. For caching issues, rebuild with `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .`.  
6. After fixing the Dockerfile, run the build again; the image should compile successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: First look at the build output to see the exact error line. Common fixes:

1. **Syntax errors** – Verify each Dockerfile instruction (FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.) is correctly written and uses proper spacing.
2. **Missing files** – Ensure any files referenced by COPY/ADD actually exist in the build context and have the right paths.
3. **Package installation** – If a RUN step fails installing packages, update the package index first (e.g., `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …`) and check for version conflicts.
4. **Permission issues** – Make sure the user running the build has read access to all source files and write access to the Docker socket.
5. **Cache problems** – Run the build with `docker build --no-cache .` to force a fresh build and rule out stale layers.
6. **Base‑image compatibility** – Pull the latest base image (`docker pull <base>`) and confirm it matches the architecture of your host.

Apply the relevant fix, then re‑run `docker build`. If the error persists, paste the exact failing line and message for a more targeted fix.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Docker build log to see which line fails. Then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (use `dockerfile_lint` or run `docker build .` locally).
2. Make sure the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled.
3. Ensure each RUN/COPY/ADD step succeeds on its own—run the failing command manually in a container (`docker run --rm <base> sh -c "<command>"`).
4. If a step depends on files, confirm the paths are correct and the files are in the build context.
5. Clear the build cache (`docker builder prune`) and rebuild with `docker build --no-cache`.
6. If the error is about permissions, add proper `USER` or `chmod` in the Dockerfile.
7. Update any outdated package manager commands (e.g., replace `apt-get install -y` with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y`).

Apply the fix to the Dockerfile, then run `docker build` again.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile syntax first—make sure each instruction is valid and all required files are referenced correctly. Verify that the base image exists and can be pulled (run docker pull your‑base‑image). Look for missing files or paths in COPY/ADD commands; adjust the source paths or add the files to the build context. If a RUN step fails, run that command manually in a temporary container from the same base image to see the exact error, then fix any package‑manager issues, missing dependencies, or permission problems. Clean the build cache (docker builder prune) and rebuild with docker build --no‑cache to ensure a fresh environment. If the problem persists, share the specific error message for a more targeted fix.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then:

1. Run `docker build --no-cache .` to force a clean rebuild and see the exact failing step.
2. Verify that every `COPY`/`ADD` source path exists relative to the build context.
3. Ensure required build‑time packages are installed (e.g., `apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>` before using them).
4. If a RUN command fails, add `set -e` to stop on errors and review its output; fix missing dependencies or incorrect flags.
5. Confirm that the base image tag is valid and not corrupted; pull a fresh copy with `docker pull <base-image>`.
6. After fixing the problematic line, rebuild normally: `docker build -t myimage .`.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
