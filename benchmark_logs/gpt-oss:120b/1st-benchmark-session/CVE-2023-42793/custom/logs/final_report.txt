CVE description: CVE‑2023‑42793 is a critical authentication‑bypass vulnerability in the JetBrains TeamCity on‑premises server. An unauthenticated attacker can issue specially crafted REST or XML‑RPC requests that create a valid authentication token for the default administrator (user id 1). With this token the attacker gains full administrative privileges and can execute arbitrary commands on the TeamCity host and its build agents, steal source code, credentials and inject malicious artifacts into the CI/CD pipeline. The flaw resides in the core request‑interceptor logic that incorrectly excludes the “/**/RPC2” path from authentication checks, allowing token creation without any login. The vulnerability is present in all self‑hosted TeamCity versions released before build 2023.05.4. Exploitation was observed in the wild by nation‑state actors beginning in September 2023, leading to remote code execution, persistence via scheduled tasks, DLL hijacking and lateral movement inside victim networks.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetbrains/teamcity-server][['2022.10.5', '2022.10.6', '2022.10.7', '2023.02.4', '2023.02.5', '2023.04.1', '2023.04.2', '2023.05.1', '2023.05.2', '2023.05.3']] Core CI/CD server that contains the vulnerable authentication code. Running any of the listed versions is directly exploitable via CVE‑2023‑42793.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['15.5']] Relational database used by TeamCity to store configuration, build history and user data. Required for a functional TeamCity deployment but does not affect the vulnerability.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration only defines a custom Flask application based on python:3.9-slim. It does not include any of the required services (jetbrains/teamcity-server or postgres), so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, the image does not reference jetbrains/teamcity-server at any version, let alone one of the listed vulnerable versions, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration only defines a custom Flask application based on python:3.9-slim. It does not include any of the required services (jetbrains/teamcity-server or postgres), so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, the image does not reference jetbrains/teamcity-server at any version, let alone one of the listed vulnerable versions, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- FIX: Add the needed services to your Docker Compose (or Docker‑file) stack and pin their images to the required versions.

1. Create a docker‑compose.yml that defines three services:
   - **app**: build from your custom Dockerfile (python:3.9‑slim) and expose the Flask port.
   - **teamcity**: image jetbrains/teamcity-server:2022.10.3 (or another non‑vulnerable tag you have vetted) and map the required ports.
   - **postgres**: image postgres:13.8 (or the version your app expects) and set the usual environment variables for user, password and database.

2. In the Flask Dockerfile, add a health‑check that waits for the DB and TeamCity endpoints before starting the app.

3. If you prefer a single Dockerfile, use multi‑stage builds:
   - Stage 1: FROM jetbrains/teamcity-server:2022.10.3 COPY any custom plugins.
   - Stage 2: FROM python:3.9‑slim COPY your Flask code and set ENV DATABASE_URL=postgres://… .

4. Run docker compose up and verify each service starts without errors; the “services_ok” milestone will pass.

5. Make sure the TeamCity image tag you choose is not in the vulnerable list; update it regularly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to see the exact error, then:

1. Verify Dockerfile syntax (misspelled instructions, wrong case, missing backslashes).
2. Ensure the base image exists and is correctly spelled.
3. Confirm all files referenced in COPY/ADD are present in the build context.
4. Make sure commands that require extra packages install them first (e.g., apt‑get update before apt‑get install).
5. Look for permission problems—add RUN chmod/chown as needed or use the proper USER.
6. If the error is from a cached layer, rebuild without cache: docker build --no‑cache .
7. Fix the identified issue and rerun the build.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Docker build logs to see the exact error line. Typical fixes are:

1. Verify Dockerfile syntax (no stray characters, proper FROM, RUN, COPY etc.).
2. Ensure the base image name and tag exist and can be pulled.
3. Confirm all referenced files (COPY/ADD) are present in the build context.
4. Make sure any commands in RUN succeed (add –‑no‑cache to force fresh execution, or run the failing command manually in a container to debug).
5. If the error is due to leftover layers, prune the build cache: docker builder prune or build with --no-cache.
6. Update any package manager indexes inside RUN (e.g., apt‑get update && apt‑get install …) before installing packages. 

Apply the relevant fix and re‑run docker build.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or invalid instructions, then run the build with verbose output to see the exact failure:

1. Verify every line (FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.)—ensure the base image exists and version tags are correct.
2. Make sure all source files referenced by COPY/ADD are present in the build context and have proper permissions.
3. Replace problematic RUN commands with explicit shell syntax (e.g., use `&&` to chain commands safely) and test them individually in a temporary container.
4. Clear any stale cache that might hide the error: `docker builder prune` then rebuild with `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .`.
5. If the error is from a package manager, add `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …` (or the equivalent) and include `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` to keep the image small.
6. Review the build logs for the exact error message; fix the reported issue and re‑run the build.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line mentioned in the build log. Verify the syntax of that instruction and any referenced files or arguments. Ensure all required build‑time arguments (‑‑build‑arg) are supplied and that paths used in COPY/ADD exist relative to the Docker context. If the error is from a failing RUN command, run the same command locally in a container (docker run --rm <base‑image> sh -c "<command>") to see the exact output and fix missing packages, permissions, or environment variables. After correcting the Dockerfile or supplying the needed arguments, rebuild with docker build . and confirm the image succeeds.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line that fails first. Typical fixes:

1. Validate the base‑image name/tag exists and can be pulled (`docker pull <image>`).  
2. Make sure any files/dirs referenced with `COPY`/`ADD` actually exist in the build context and have correct permissions.  
3. If you run a command that installs packages, add `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …` (or the equivalent for your distro) and clean‑up caches to avoid “package not found” errors.  
4. If the error is a syntax problem, verify Dockerfile instructions are correctly capitalized and ordered (e.g., `FROM` first, then `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`).  
5. Look at the exact error message; often it points to a missing dependency or a failing script—fix the script or install the missing dependency.  
6. After adjusting, rebuild with `docker build --no-cache .` to ensure changes are applied.


Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!
