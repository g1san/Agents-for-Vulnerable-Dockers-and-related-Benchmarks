    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is an authentication\u2011bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity on\u2011premises server. The flaw resides in TeamCity's request\u2011interceptor logic, which incorrectly disables authorization for certain REST API paths. An unauthenticated attacker can call the hidden token\u2011creation endpoint (e.g., /app/rest/users/id:1/tokens/RPC2) to obtain a valid token for the default admin account, then use that token to create new administrative users, execute builds, and ultimately run arbitrary code on the host. The vulnerability affects all TeamCity versions released before 2023.05.4. Exploitation requires only the base URL of the vulnerable server and no prior credentials. Successful exploitation grants full control over the CI/CD server, including access to source code, build agents, and any secrets stored within TeamCity. The flaw has been actively exploited in the wild by nation\u2011state actors, with observed post\u2011exploitation activity such as DLL\u2011search\u2011order hijacking, scheduled\u2011task persistence, and use of remote\u2011access tools.",
