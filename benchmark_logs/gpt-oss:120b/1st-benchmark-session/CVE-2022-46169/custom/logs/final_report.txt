CVE description: CVE‑2022‑46169 is a critical unauthenticated command‑injection vulnerability in the Cacti web‑application (network‑monitoring front‑end for RRDtool). The flaw resides in the /remote_agent.php script. The script determines client authorization by extracting the client IP from a number of HTTP headers (such as X‑Forwarded‑For) and then checks this IP against entries in the poller database table. Because the script trusts these headers, an attacker can send a crafted header containing an IP address that matches a poller entry and bypass authentication entirely. Once authorized, the attacker can invoke the "polldata" action. The server reads request parameters (host_id, local_data_id, poller_id) and, for any poller_item whose action is POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP, builds a command line that concatenates the supplied poller_id directly into a proc_open call. This allows arbitrary command injection, leading to remote code execution under the web‑user (www‑data) context. The vulnerability affects all Cacti releases up to and including version 1.2.22 and earlier 1.1.x releases. It was patched in Cacti 1.2.23 and later, as well as in the 1.3.0 release.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then run a clean build: docker system prune to remove old caches, and rebuild with docker build –no-cache. Verify that the base image exists and that any required build‑time dependencies are installed. If the build still fails, inspect the exact error message in the build logs to pinpoint the problematic step and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or unsupported commands. Verify that all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) exist in the build context and have correct permissions. Ensure the base image name and tag are correct and can be pulled. Look at the exact error line in the build output; address missing packages, mismatched package manager commands, or failing RUN steps. If a RUN step fails, add “&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*” (or equivalent) to keep layers clean, and consider using “--no-cache” to force a fresh build. Finally, run docker build with --progress=plain to get detailed logs and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to see the exact error message, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (e.g., correct FROM, RUN, COPY statements).
2. Ensure the base image exists and is spelled correctly.
3. Make sure any files referenced by COPY/ADD actually exist in the build context.
4. Confirm required packages are installed with the proper package manager commands and that they succeed (add `&&` to chain commands and handle errors).
5. If the error is about missing dependencies, add the necessary `apt-get update && apt-get install …` lines.
6. If a command fails, run it interactively in a temporary container (`docker run -it <base>`), fix the command, then update the Dockerfile.
7. Clean up any dangling layers or caches (`docker builder prune`) and rebuild.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors and missing files, then rebuild with cleared caches:

1. Verify each instruction (FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.) is correct and the referenced files exist in the build context.
2. Ensure permissions allow Docker to read the files you COPY/ADD.
3. Add a .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary large files that might cause out‑of‑memory or timeout failures.
4. Run the build without cache to force a fresh start: docker build --no-cache -t your-image .
5. If a RUN step fails, inspect the command manually in a container (docker run -it base-image /bin/sh) to see missing dependencies or network issues, then add the needed packages or configure proxy settings.
6. Finally, re‑run docker build and verify it completes successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then rebuild with a clean cache:

1. Verify each instruction (FROM, COPY, RUN, etc.) points to existing paths and correct syntax.
2. Ensure the base image name and tag are valid and reachable.
3. Run `docker builder prune` to clear any corrupted cache.
4. Re‑run the build with `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .` to see the exact failing step.
5. If a specific RUN command fails, isolate it, test the command on a running container, and adjust any package names, paths, or environment variables accordingly. Once the offending step is corrected, the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to identify the exact error, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (missing FROM, wrong instruction order, incorrect paths).
2. Ensure the base image name and tag exist and can be pulled.
3. Confirm all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) are present and have correct permissions.
4. Run the build with docker build --no-cache to rule out layer caching issues.
5. If a command fails, test it interactively in a temporary container (docker run -it base‑image /bin/sh) and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.
6. After fixing the cause, rebuild the image.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then run a clean build to see the exact error:

1. Inspect the Dockerfile line‑by‑line; ensure each command is correct and all referenced files exist in the build context.  
2. Remove any stale layers: docker builder prune or docker system prune –a.  
3. Re‑build with full output: docker build --no-cache --progress=plain . Read the error message and address the specific cause (e.g., missing package, wrong URL, permission issue).  
4. If a step fails due to network or package source, verify connectivity and update the package repository URLs.  
5. After fixing the issue, run the build again.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to see the exact error line, then:

1. Verify Dockerfile syntax (no stray characters, proper FROM, RUN, COPY statements).
2. Ensure the base image exists and is reachable (docker pull <image> works).
3. If a RUN step fails, run that command locally in a container to debug missing packages or permission issues.
4. Add missing dependencies or correct apt/yum commands (use `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …` in one RUN layer).
5. Make sure all referenced files exist in the build context and have correct paths in COPY/ADD.
6. Clear the cache if stale layers may cause problems: `docker builder prune` then rebuild.
7. If the error is about insufficient resources, increase Docker’s memory/CPU limits or use `--no-cache` to force a clean build.

Apply the fix, then run `docker build .` again.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build log to locate the exact failing step. Then:

1. Verify Dockerfile syntax (especially FROM, RUN, COPY paths).
2. Ensure the base image tag exists and can be pulled.
3. Confirm all files referenced by COPY/ADD are present in the build context.
4. Make any RUN commands idempotent and add required packages or dependencies.
5. Run the build with docker build --no-cache to force a clean rebuild.
6. If a specific command fails, run it manually in an interactive container (docker run -it <base> /bin/sh) to debug and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
