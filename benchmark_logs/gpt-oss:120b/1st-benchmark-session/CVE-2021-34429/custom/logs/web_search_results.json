    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201134429 is a path\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server. Jetty fails to properly normalize request URIs that contain encoded characters such as %u002e (Unicode dot) or null bytes before decoding. An attacker can craft a request like GET /%u002e/WEB-INF/web.xml that Jetty treats as ../WEB-INF/web.xml, allowing the server to return files located in the protected WEB\u2011INF directory. This leads to unauthorized disclosure of configuration files, servlet mappings, security constraints, and potentially other sensitive resources inside the web application.",
