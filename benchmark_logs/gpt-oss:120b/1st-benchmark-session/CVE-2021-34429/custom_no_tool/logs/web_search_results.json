    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201134429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server where Jetty fails to correctly normalize encoded characters in the request URI. An attacker can supply specially crafted URIs containing encoded dot\u2011segments (e.g., %u002e) or encoded null characters (%00) that bypass normal path checks and allow access to files under the protected WEB\u2011INF directory. This results in unauthorized disclosure of internal configuration files such as web.xml, applicationContext.xml, or any other resources placed in WEB\u2011INF. The flaw affects multiple Jetty releases and can be exploited by sending a single HTTP GET request; no authentication or additional services are required.",
