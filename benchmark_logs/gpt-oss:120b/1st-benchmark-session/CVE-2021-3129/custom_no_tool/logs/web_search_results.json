    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u20113129 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Laravel framework caused by an insecure deserialization path in the Ignition error\u2011page package.  Versions of Ignition prior to 2.5.2 allow an attacker to supply a crafted PHAR archive (or other serialized payload) that is later deserialized by the Ignition error handler.  The deserialization can be triggered through a request that causes Laravel to log attacker\u2011controlled data or to pass a user\u2011controlled value to Ignition\u2019s solution\u2011execution endpoint.  When the malicious payload is processed, PHP executes attacker\u2011controlled commands with the privileges of the PHP process, giving the attacker full command\u2011execution capabilities on the server.  The vulnerability is unauthenticated and works when the application runs in debug mode or when the vulnerable Ignition package is present.  Exploits typically use phpggc to generate a malicious PHAR that invokes the Monolog or Laravel gadget chains, then cause the PHAR to be deserialized via Ignition, resulting in arbitrary command execution.  The issue was fixed in Ignition version 2.5.2 and Laravel version 8.4.3; upgrading or disabling Ignition in production mitigates the flaw.",
