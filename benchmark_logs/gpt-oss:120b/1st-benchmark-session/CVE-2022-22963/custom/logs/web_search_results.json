    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201122963 is a vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function's routing functionality. The component accepts a user\u2011supplied Spring Expression Language (SpEL) string via the `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` header (or request parameter). The supplied SpEL is evaluated by `StandardEvaluationContext` without proper validation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host. A crafted HTTP request can invoke `java.lang.Runtime.exec` or other Java APIs, leading to remote code execution with the privileges of the Java process (often root in container deployments). The flaw exists in Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and all older, unsupported releases. It was disclosed by security researcher m09u3r and fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.3. Exploitation requires only network access to the vulnerable endpoint, typically `/functionRouter`, and the ability to set the vulnerable header.",
