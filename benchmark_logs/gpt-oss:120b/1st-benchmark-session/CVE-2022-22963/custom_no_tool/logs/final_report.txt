CVE description: CVE‑2022‑22963 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function. The flaw resides in the function router component where the HTTP header `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` is interpreted as a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) string without any validation. An attacker can supply a crafted SpEL payload (for example `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned")`) which is evaluated inside a `StandardEvaluationContext`. Because the expression is executed with full Java privileges, arbitrary system commands can be run, files can be created or read, and full control of the host container can be obtained. The vulnerability affects Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and any older, unsupported releases. Exploitation requires only network access to the vulnerable HTTP endpoint (typically port 8080) and does not need authentication. The impact is complete remote code execution with the privileges of the Java process. The issue is mitigated by upgrading to Spring Cloud Function 3.1.7, 3.2.3 or any later version, or by disabling the function router endpoint.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][springcloudfunction/function][['3.1.6', '3.2.2']] Spring Cloud Function library that contains the vulnerable function router component. The listed versions are the ones that evaluate the routing‑expression header without restriction, enabling remote code execution.
- [SOFT-BASE][openjdk][['11-jre-slim']] Base Java runtime required to run the Spring Cloud Function application inside the Docker container.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
