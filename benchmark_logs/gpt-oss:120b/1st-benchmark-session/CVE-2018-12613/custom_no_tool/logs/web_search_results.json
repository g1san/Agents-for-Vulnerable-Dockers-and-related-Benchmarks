    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201112613 is a remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. The flaw resides in the page\u2011loader logic (index.php) where the `target` request parameter is passed to an include statement without proper validation. An attacker can craft a URL such as `index.php?target=../../../../etc/passwd%00` or use a double\u2011encoded traversal (`%253f`) to force phpMyAdmin to include arbitrary files from the server. When the included file contains attacker\u2011controlled PHP code (for example, a malicious session file created via a crafted SQL query), the code is executed with the privileges of the web\u2011server process, giving the attacker full command execution, file read/write, and complete system takeover. The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user if the installation is mis\u2011configured, but it is exploitable with valid phpMyAdmin credentials in a typical deployment.",
