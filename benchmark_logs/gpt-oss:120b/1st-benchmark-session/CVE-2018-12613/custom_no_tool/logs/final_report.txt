CVE description: CVE‑2018‑12613 is a remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. The flaw resides in the page‑loader logic (index.php) where the `target` request parameter is passed to an include statement without proper validation. An attacker can craft a URL such as `index.php?target=../../../../etc/passwd%00` or use a double‑encoded traversal (`%253f`) to force phpMyAdmin to include arbitrary files from the server. When the included file contains attacker‑controlled PHP code (for example, a malicious session file created via a crafted SQL query), the code is executed with the privileges of the web‑server process, giving the attacker full command execution, file read/write, and complete system takeover. The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user if the installation is mis‑configured, but it is exploitable with valid phpMyAdmin credentials in a typical deployment.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] Vulnerable phpMyAdmin web interface that contains the flawed include handling. Required to demonstrate the CVE.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Relational database required by phpMyAdmin for storing configuration and session data, enabling the application to start.
- [SOFT-WEB][httpd][['2.4']] Web server that can serve the phpMyAdmin container when running in a multi‑container setup; needed for a complete Docker environment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Check container status: docker ps -a and note its state.  
View recent logs: docker logs <container_name_or_id> to see errors.  
If it exited, inspect exit code: docker inspect --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}' <id>.  
Common fixes:  
- Restart: docker restart <id>  
- Re‑create with fresh image: docker rm -f <id> && docker run …  
- Verify required files/volumes exist and have correct permissions.  
- Ensure needed ports are not blocked and the host network is reachable.  
- Update the image if a bug was fixed: docker pull <image> && docker run …  
After applying the fix, run docker ps to confirm the container is Up.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line that fails (the error message will show the line number). Typical fixes:

1. **Update the base image** – pull the latest tag (`docker pull <base>`), then rebuild.
2. **Correct syntax errors** – ensure each instruction is on its own line, no stray characters, proper escape (`\`) usage.
3. **Install missing packages** – add `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y <pkg>` (or the equivalent for your distro) before any commands that need them.
4. **Fix file copy paths** – verify the source files exist relative to the Docker build context and that the `COPY`/`ADD` destinations are valid directories.
5. **Handle permissions** – if a command fails due to access, add `USER root` before the step or adjust `chmod/chown` on the copied files.
6. **Cache busting** – if a layer is cached with an error, force a rebuild with `--no-cache` or modify a prior line to invalidate the cache.
7. **Check Docker daemon resources** – ensure enough disk space, memory, and CPU; clean up with `docker system prune` if needed.

After applying the appropriate fix, run `docker build .` again. If the error persists, copy the exact error output and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The phpMyAdmin service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default host port 80, so it is not accessible via its standard network port. MySQL and httpd services use their default ports (3306 and 80 respectively), but the mismatch for phpMyAdmin causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The phpMyAdmin service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default host port 80, so it is not accessible via its standard network port. MySQL and httpd services use their default ports (3306 and 80 respectively), but the mismatch for phpMyAdmin causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Edit the service definition (docker‑compose.yml or the docker run command) for phpMyAdmin so the host port matches the container port.

Example for docker‑compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin
    ports:
      - "80:80"    # change from "8080:80"
```

If you’re using `docker run`, change the `-p` flag:

```bash
docker run -d --name phpmyadmin -p 80:80 phpmyadmin
```

After updating, redeploy the stack (e.g., `docker-compose up -d`). This aligns phpMyAdmin with the expected host port 80, allowing the network_setup milestone to pass.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The httpd service maps host port 8080 to the container's port 80 ("8080:80"), which does not expose the service on its default HTTP port (80). While MySQL (3306:3306) and phpMyAdmin (80:80) use their default ports, the deviation for httpd means not all services are configured on their default network ports.
	- ERROR: The httpd service maps host port 8080 to the container's port 80 ("8080:80"), which does not expose the service on its default HTTP port (80). While MySQL (3306:3306) and phpMyAdmin (80:80) use their default ports, the deviation for httpd means not all services are configured on their default network ports.
	- FIX: Change the port mapping for the httpd container to use the default host port 80.

**If using `docker run`**  
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name httpd httpd:latest
```
(Stop and remove any existing container first.)

**If using Docker Compose**  
Edit the service definition:

```yaml
services:
  httpd:
    image: httpd:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

Then run `docker compose up -d` (or `docker-compose up -d`). Ensure no other process is listening on host port 80 before restarting.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The phpmyadmin service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which deviates from the default host port 80. Therefore not all services are using their default network ports.
	- ERROR: The phpmyadmin service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which deviates from the default host port 80. Therefore not all services are using their default network ports.
	- FIX: Edit the service definition (e.g., in docker‑compose.yml) and set the ports mapping to the default HTTP port, e.g.:

ports:
  - "80:80"

or simply remove the ports line so the container uses the host’s port 80 automatically (ensuring the host port is not already in use). This aligns phpMyAdmin with the standard port configuration used by the other services.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The httpd service maps container port 80 to host port 8080, which deviates from the default HTTP port 80 for external access. Consequently, not all services are configured to use their default network ports.
	- ERROR: The httpd service maps container port 80 to host port 8080, which deviates from the default HTTP port 80 for external access. Consequently, not all services are configured to use their default network ports.
	- FIX: Change the Docker run (or compose) configuration to map the container’s port 80 directly to the host’s port 80 (e.g., `-p 80:80` or `ports: - "80:80"`). If host‑level port 80 is unavailable, adjust firewall/NAT rules to forward external traffic from port 80 to the host’s 8080, or reconfigure dependent services to use port 8080 consistently. This restores the default HTTP port for external access.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The phpMyAdmin service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default network port for the service. All other services use their default ports, but this mismatch causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The phpMyAdmin service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default network port for the service. All other services use their default ports, but this mismatch causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Change the phpMyAdmin service port mapping to use the default port 80 (e.g., `ports: ["80:80"]`) or update any configuration or tests that expect port 8080 to reference the new host port 80. This aligns the service with the default networking expectations and allows the network_setup milestone to succeed.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The httpd service is mapped to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default port 80. This deviation means not all services are using their default network ports, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The httpd service is mapped to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default port 80. This deviation means not all services are using their default network ports, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Change the container port mapping to the default HTTP port. Edit the Docker command or docker‑compose.yml so the service uses 80:80 instead of 8080:80, then restart the container (e.g., docker compose up -d or docker run -p 80:80 …). If the network‑setup scripts expect port 80, this will satisfy the milestone. If you must keep the host port 8080, update the network‑setup configuration to reference port 8080 instead of the default.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then rebuild with more logs to pinpoint the failure.

1. Run `docker build . --no-cache --progress=plain` to see the exact error line.
2. Verify that all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources, scripts, etc.) exist in the build context and have correct paths.
3. Ensure required build‑time packages are installed in the base image (add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>` or equivalent).
4. If a command fails, add `set -ex` at the top of any RUN scripts to surface the failing step.
5. Confirm the base image tag is valid and not outdated; pull the latest with `docker pull <base-image>:<tag>`.

After fixing the identified issue, run `docker build .` again. If the build still stops, capture the full error output and adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The phpMyAdmin service maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default port for phpMyAdmin (default is 80). All other services use their default ports, but this deviation causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
