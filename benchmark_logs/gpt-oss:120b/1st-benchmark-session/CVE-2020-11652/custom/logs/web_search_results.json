    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111652 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt master service. The flaw resides in the Salt master\u2019s execution pathway (wheel and execution modules as well as the file_roots.write function) where user\u2011controlled arguments are not properly sanitized. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the Salt master\u2019s network ports (4505/4506 for the ZeroMQ interface or the salt\u2011api HTTP endpoint) can invoke these modules to perform directory\u2011traversal and arbitrary file\u2011write operations, which in turn allow the execution of any operating\u2011system command on the master host. Because the Salt master typically runs as the root user, the attacker obtains full system compromise, can read or overwrite any file, schedule cron jobs, or execute commands on connected minions. The vulnerability affects all Salt releases prior to version 2019.2.4 and prior to version 3000.2. Exploits demonstrated in public proof\u2011of\u2011concept code show the ability to issue commands such as `whoami`, open a reverse shell, read `/etc/passwd`, and write files to privileged locations using path\u2011traversal payloads. Mitigation requires upgrading to a fixed Salt version and restricting network access to the master\u2019s ports.",
