    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Function framework, specifically affecting versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution by exploiting the routing functionality through a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) as a routing-expression. Attackers can use the HTTP request header `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` to inject and execute arbitrary code on the host machine. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to local resources and potentially compromise the host or container. The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit and can result in severe impact if not promptly patched. Users are advised to upgrade to versions 3.1.7 or 3.2.3 to mitigate this issue.",
