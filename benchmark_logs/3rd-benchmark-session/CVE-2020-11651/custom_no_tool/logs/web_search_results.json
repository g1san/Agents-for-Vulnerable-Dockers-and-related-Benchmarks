    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt software, specifically affecting the Salt Master service. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and execute arbitrary commands on the Salt Master server and all connected minions. The issue arises from improper validation of inputs in the ClearFuncs class, which is accessible over the network. This flaw allows a remote user to access certain methods without authentication, enabling them to retrieve user tokens from the salt master, execute arbitrary commands on the master and minions, read sensitive files such as '/etc/shadow', and upload files. The vulnerability affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and control over the Salt infrastructure, emphasizing the need for users to update their SaltStack installations to versions with necessary security patches.",
