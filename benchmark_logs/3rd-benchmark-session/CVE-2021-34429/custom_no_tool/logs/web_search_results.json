    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, which affects the `jetty-webapp` package versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. This vulnerability allows path traversal attacks using encoded URIs, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files within the WEB-INF directory, such as the `web.xml` file. The issue arises from improper URI normalization and decoding, allowing attackers to craft requests that bypass security constraints. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication, posing a moderate risk to confidentiality and integrity of affected systems. It has been addressed in Jetty versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6.",
