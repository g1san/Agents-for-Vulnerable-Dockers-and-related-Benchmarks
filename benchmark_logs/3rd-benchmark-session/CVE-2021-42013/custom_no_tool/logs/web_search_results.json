    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This issue stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773. The flaw involves a path traversal attack, which allows attackers to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. This can potentially lead to remote code execution, particularly if CGI scripts are enabled on the server. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the path normalization process, allowing attackers to access files outside the directories specified by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" the requests may succeed. This vulnerability does not affect versions earlier than 2.4.49 and was fixed in version 2.4.51.",
