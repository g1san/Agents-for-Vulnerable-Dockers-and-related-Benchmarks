    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability found in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting the `jetty-webapp` package. The affected versions are 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5, and 11.0.1-11.0.5. This vulnerability allows attackers to access protected files within the WEB-INF directory by exploiting encoded URIs and ambiguous paths. Attackers can use techniques involving encoded characters like `%u002e` or null characters to bypass security constraints and access sensitive files such as `web.xml`. This issue arises because the server performs normalization before decoding, contrary to RFC standards, leading to unauthorized access and information disclosure. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating a moderate severity level, and requires no privileges or user interaction for exploitation. It was addressed in patched versions 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6, which restore defense by decoding URIs before normalization.",
