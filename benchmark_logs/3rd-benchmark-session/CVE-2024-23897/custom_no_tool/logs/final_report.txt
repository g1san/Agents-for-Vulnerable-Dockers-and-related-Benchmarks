CVE description: CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability found in Jenkins, a widely-used open-source automation server. The flaw is specifically located in Jenkins' command line interface (CLI), which utilizes the args4j library to process command-line commands. The vulnerability arises from a feature in the args4j library that automatically replaces an '@' character followed by a file path with the contents of the file. This feature is enabled by default in Jenkins versions 2.441 and earlier, including LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. As a result, attackers with Overall/Read permission can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. Even attackers without such permissions can read the first few lines of files. The exposure of sensitive file contents can lead to remote code execution if attackers access binary secrets or other critical information. The vulnerability can also be exploited through various attack vectors such as Resource Root URLs, "Remember me" cookies, cross-site scripting (XSS), and CSRF protection bypass. To mitigate the risk, Jenkins has released updates that disable this feature and recommends disabling CLI access as an immediate workaround.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jenkins][['2.441', '2.441---LTS 2.426.2']] Jenkins is the service with the vulnerability. The specific versions listed are known to be vulnerable to CVE-2024-23897.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['8-jdk']] OpenJDK is required to run Jenkins, as Jenkins is a Java application.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is often used as a database for Jenkins to store build data and other persistent information.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy to serve Jenkins, providing SSL termination and improved performance.
