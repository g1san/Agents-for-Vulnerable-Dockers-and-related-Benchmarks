----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2020-7247 is a critical vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, specifically affecting versions before 6.6.2. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root on affected systems. The issue arises from improper input validation in the smtp_mailaddr function within smtp_session.c, where shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM field are not adequately escaped. This vulnerability is present in the default configuration of OpenSMTPD when it is uncommented. Exploiting this flaw involves crafting a malicious SMTP session that leverages these metacharacters to execute arbitrary shell commands. The vulnerability was identified by Qualys Security Advisory and has been demonstrated on various versions of OpenBSD, including 6.6, 6.5, 6.4, and 5.9. The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading OpenSMTPD to version 6.6.2 or later.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
