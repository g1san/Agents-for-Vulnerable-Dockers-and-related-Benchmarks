CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a directory traversal vulnerability in SaltStack's Salt, a configuration management tool. This vulnerability affects the Salt Master service, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files on the Salt Master server. The issue arises from the improper sanitization of paths within the ClearFuncs class of the salt-master process. This flaw allows remote attackers to exploit directory traversal flaws to access any file on the server, such as '/etc/passwd', without authentication. This can lead to further system compromise, as attackers can read critical files, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially gain control over the server and connected minions. Affected versions include Salt 2019.2.3 and earlier, and 3000.1 and earlier, as well as unsupported versions like 2015.8.x to 2018.3.x. Patched versions 2019.2.4 and 3000.2 address this vulnerability.
Attack Type: Unauthorized access to sensitive files
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2015.8.0---2018.3.4', '2019.2.0---2019.2.3', '3000.0---3000.1']] SaltStack Salt is the core service affected by CVE-2020-11652, specifically the Salt Master service, which is vulnerable to unauthorized file access due to directory traversal flaws.
- [SOFT][python][['2.7', '3.6']] Python is required to run SaltStack Salt and its associated scripts.
- [SOFT][ubuntu][['18.04']] Ubuntu serves as a base operating system for running the Salt Master service.
