    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, also known as Log4Shell, is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, a widely used Java-based logging library. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution by exploiting the JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) features within Log4j. When a specially crafted string is logged, it can trigger a lookup and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. The vulnerability affects Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. It is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited without authentication, affecting numerous applications and services using Log4j for logging. The ease of exploitation and potential impact have led to a high CVSS score, making it a significant security risk.",
