CVE description: CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, a widely used tool for managing MySQL databases. The issue arises from improper handling of parameters in the preg_replace() function within phpMyAdmin's table search-and-replace feature. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other severe impacts. The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. It specifically affects PHP versions before 5.4.7 where the 'e' modifier in preg_replace could be used to execute PHP code. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid credentials for phpMyAdmin. The issue was discovered by Michal Čihař and Cure53 and mitigated in PHP 5.4.7 and above, which prevent code execution via preg_replace entirely.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.0.0---4.0.10.15', '4.4.0---4.4.15.6', '4.6.0---4.6.2']] phpMyAdmin is the primary service vulnerable to CVE-2016-5734 due to its improper handling of parameters in the preg_replace function, which can lead to remote code execution.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL is the database service managed by phpMyAdmin and is necessary for phpMyAdmin to function.
- [SOFT][php][['5.4.0---5.4.6']] PHP is required to run phpMyAdmin, and versions prior to 5.4.7 are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
