    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201144228, commonly referred to as Log4Shell, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 logging library. Versions of the log4j\u2011core module from 2.0\u2011beta9 through 2.15.0 (including all intermediate releases such as 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9.0, 2.10.0, 2.11.0, 2.12.0, 2.13.0, 2.14.0, 2.14.1, and 2.15.0) allow unrestricted JNDI lookups. When an attacker can cause a vulnerable application to log attacker\u2011controlled data, Log4j will evaluate the `${jndi:ldap://\u2026}` (or other JNDI) expression, contact the attacker\u2011controlled LDAP/RMI server, download a malicious Java class, and execute it. This gives the attacker full control over the host system without any authentication. The flaw is exploitable over the network, is \u201cwormable,\u201d and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0. Mitigation requires upgrading Log4j to a version where JNDI lookups are disabled or removed (\u2265\u202f2.16.0) or applying the official work\u2011arounds such as setting `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` or removing the `JndiLookup` class from the classpath.",
