    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is an argument\u2011injection vulnerability in the PHP CGI binary (php\u2011cgi). When PHP is executed as a CGI program, the code that parses the query string fails to skip option parsing for the `-d` switch if the query string does not contain an unescaped \u2018=\u2019 character. An attacker can therefore inject arbitrary command\u2011line options or PHP configuration directives directly in the URL (for example `?-dallow_url_include=On -dauto_prepend_file=php://input`). By using these injected options the attacker can force PHP to include attacker\u2011supplied code from the request body and achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. The flaw also allows source\u2011code disclosure by using the `-s` option. The vulnerability affects specific older releases of PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 that are built for the CGI SAPI.",
