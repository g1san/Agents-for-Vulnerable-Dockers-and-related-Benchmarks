CVE description: CVE‑2021‑41773 is a critical path‑traversal and remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. The flaw originates from an incorrect implementation of the URL path normalisation routine in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. After URL‑decoding, the routine only removes the first ".." sequence, allowing an attacker to craft URLs containing encoded traversal sequences such as "..%2f", ".%2e/" or similar variations. When the server’s root directory (<Directory />) or a CGI‑bin alias is configured with "Require all granted" (the default in many installations), the malformed path bypasses the document‑root restriction and the server will serve files from anywhere on the filesystem, including sensitive files like /etc/passwd, SSH private keys, or configuration files. If the mod_cgi module is enabled, the same bypass can be used to reach the cgi-bin directory, invoke a CGI script, and execute arbitrary commands, leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability was partially addressed in Apache 2.4.50 but the fix was incomplete; the issue remains exploitable in both 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 and was fully remediated only in Apache 2.4.51. No additional modules or external services are required to exploit the flaw; a simple HTTP GET request with a crafted path is sufficient to retrieve files or, when CGI is enabled, to achieve remote code execution.
Attack Type: path traversal and remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49', '2.4.50']] Apache HTTP Server image containing the vulnerable versions; this core web service is the sole component required for the vulnerability to be present.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Apache service inside the container listens on its default port 80 (ExposedPorts: 80/tcp), but the docker-compose file maps this container port to host port 8080 (ports: "8080:80"). Therefore the service is not exposed on the default network port (80) on the host, which violates the 'network_setup' milestone.
	- ERROR: The Apache service inside the container listens on its default port 80 (ExposedPorts: 80/tcp), but the docker-compose file maps this container port to host port 8080 (ports: "8080:80"). Therefore the service is not exposed on the default network port (80) on the host, which violates the 'network_setup' milestone.
	- FIX: Modify the compose file’s ports mapping to expose the container’s port 80 on the host’s port 80, e.g.:

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    ports:
      - "80:80"
``` 

(or add an additional entry “80:80” alongside the existing “8080:80” if you need both ports).
