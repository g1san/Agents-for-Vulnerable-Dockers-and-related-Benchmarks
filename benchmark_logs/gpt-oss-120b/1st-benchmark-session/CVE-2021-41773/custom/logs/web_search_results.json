    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201141773 is a path\u2011traversal and local file inclusion vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. The flaw originates from an incorrect path\u2011normalisation implementation introduced in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49. An attacker can craft a URL that contains sequences such as \"../\" which cause the server to resolve the request to a location outside the configured document root. If the root directory (\"/\") is not protected with a \"Require all denied\" directive, the server will serve the contents of arbitrary files on the host file system. This enables read\u2011only disclosure of sensitive files such as password databases, configuration files, or source code of CGI scripts. In environments where CGI scripts are mapped to the traversed path, the attacker may also achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability is triggered simply by sending an HTTP request; no authentication or special privileges are required. It is limited to Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50; earlier releases are not affected. The issue was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and later. Exploitation is widely observed in the wild, and the vulnerability has been referenced by multiple security advisories and the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.",
