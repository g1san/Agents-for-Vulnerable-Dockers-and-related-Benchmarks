CVE description: CVE‑2018‑12613 is a remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. The flaw resides in the handling of the `target` (or `p`) parameter in `index.php`, which allows an attacker to bypass the whitelist of internal pages and force PHP to include arbitrary files. By supplying specially crafted values (for example using directory‑traversal, null‑byte, or encoded `?` sequences) the attacker can cause phpMyAdmin to include a file that contains attacker‑controlled PHP code, such as a session or cache file where a malicious SQL query has stored PHP payload. When the file is included, the payload is executed with the privileges of the web‑server process, giving the attacker full command execution on the host. The vulnerability can be exploited both with authenticated access (by writing malicious code into a session/cache file) and, under certain misconfigurations, without authentication. The issue is fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.8.2 and later.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] Core vulnerable application; the insecure handling of the target parameter enables remote code execution.
- [SOFT-WEB][apache][['2.4.41']] Web server required to host the phpMyAdmin instance.
- [SOFT][php][['7.2.24']] PHP runtime needed for phpMyAdmin to execute; provides the environment where the injected PHP code runs.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
