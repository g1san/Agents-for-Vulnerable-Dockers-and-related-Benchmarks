CVE description: CVE‑2018‑12613 is a remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. The flaw resides in the page‑loader logic (index.php) where the `target` request parameter is passed to an include statement without proper validation. An attacker can craft a URL such as `index.php?target=../../../../etc/passwd%00` or use a double‑encoded traversal (`%253f`) to force phpMyAdmin to include arbitrary files from the server. When the included file contains attacker‑controlled PHP code (for example, a malicious session file created via a crafted SQL query), the code is executed with the privileges of the web‑server process, giving the attacker full command execution, file read/write, and complete system takeover. The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user if the installation is mis‑configured, but it is exploitable with valid phpMyAdmin credentials in a typical deployment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line that fails (the error message will show the line number). Typical fixes:

1. Verify the base image name and tag exist; update to a valid tag if needed.  
2. Make sure any files referenced with COPY or ADD exist in the build context and have correct paths.  
3. If the error is a missing package, add the required repository or update the package manager command (e.g., apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y <pkg>).  
4. For permission‑related failures, add a RUN step to set proper ownership (e.g., RUN chown -R appuser:appgroup /app) or switch to a non‑root user after installing dependencies.  
5. If the build runs out of space, clean the apt cache or use multi‑stage builds to keep only runtime artifacts.

Apply the relevant change, rebuild with docker build . and confirm the error disappears.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line that triggers the failure (the error message will show the step number). Common fixes:

1. **Syntax errors** – Ensure each instruction is valid (e.g., proper FROM, RUN, COPY syntax) and that line continuations use `\` correctly.
2. **Missing files** – Verify any `COPY`/`ADD` sources exist relative to the build context and have correct permissions.
3. **Package install failures** – Update the package index before installing (`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y …`) and clean caches (`rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) to avoid stale metadata.
4. **Incorrect base image** – Confirm the base image tag exists and is compatible with your commands (e.g., Alpine vs. Debian package managers).
5. **Build cache issues** – Run the build with `--no-cache` to force a fresh start: `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .`.
6. **Permissions** – If a command needs root, add `USER root` before it, then switch back if needed.

After adjusting the problematic instruction, rebuild: `docker build -t myimage .`. If the error persists, paste the exact error line for a more precise fix.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build output to locate the exact error line, then:

1. Verify the Dockerfile syntax (correct FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.).
2. Ensure the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled.
3. Confirm any files or directories referenced by COPY/ADD are present in the build context and have proper permissions.
4. If the error is from a RUN command, test that command locally on a container of the same base image.
5. Clean the build cache (`docker builder prune` or `docker build --no-cache …`) and rebuild.
6. Update any package manager commands to use non‑interactive flags (e.g., `apt-get -y install …`) to avoid prompts that break the build.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or unsupported commands. 
1. Run the build with ‑‑no‑cache to see the exact failing step: docker build ‑‑no‑cache -t myimage .  
2. Make sure the base image name and tag exist and are accessible (pull it manually first).  
3. Verify that any files referenced by COPY/ADD actually exist in the build context and have correct permissions.  
4. If you use multi‑stage builds, ensure each stage is correctly named and referenced.  
5. Look for missing dependencies in RUN steps—add required packages or update the package manager cache (e.g., apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y …).  
6. If the error is “permission denied” or “cannot stat”, adjust file permissions or use the appropriate USER before the failing command.  
7. After correcting the Dockerfile, rebuild the image; the build should complete.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile line indicated by the build log. Common fixes:

1. Verify the base image name and tag exist (pull latest if needed).  
2. Ensure all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) are present in the build context and paths are correct.  
3. Confirm required packages are available for apt/yum installs; add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>` or similar before installing.  
4. If a command fails, add `&&` to chain steps or split into separate RUN lines to isolate the error.  
5. Look for syntax errors (missing backslashes, incorrect ENV/ARG usage).  

After correcting the offending line, run `docker build .` again. If the error persists, share the exact log line for more precise guidance.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or unsupported commands. Make sure the base image name and tag are correct and still available. Verify all URLs, package names, and file paths used in RUN, COPY, or ADD steps exist and are reachable from the build context. If the error mentions a missing package, update the package list (e.g., apt‑get update) before installing. Remove any stray characters or invisible Unicode symbols that can break parsing. Finally, rebuild with docker build --no-cache to ensure a clean run and review the full build log for the exact failing line.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then:

1. Run the build with full logs: `docker build . --progress=plain` to see the exact failure point.  
2. Verify the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled (try `docker pull <base>`).  
3. Ensure any files referenced by `COPY`/`ADD` are present in the build context and have correct paths.  
4. If the error is “no space left on device,” clean up old images/containers: `docker system prune -a` or increase disk space.  
5. If network time‑outs occur, try building with `--network=host` or a reliable DNS.  
6. Remove cached layers that might be corrupted: `docker build . --no-cache`.  

Apply the fix revealed by the log, then rebuild.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The phpmyadmin service maps host port 8080 to container port 80 ("- \"8080:80\"") instead of using the default MySQL client port 80. This deviates from the expected default network ports, causing the network_setup milestone to fail. All other services use their default ports (MySQL 3306 and httpd 80), but the mismatch for phpmyadmin prevents full compliance.
	- ERROR: The phpmyadmin service maps host port 8080 to container port 80 ("- \"8080:80\"") instead of using the default MySQL client port 80. This deviates from the expected default network ports, causing the network_setup milestone to fail. All other services use their default ports (MySQL 3306 and httpd 80), but the mismatch for phpmyadmin prevents full compliance.
	- FIX: Edit the docker‑compose.yml file and change the phpmyadmin service’s ports entry from:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:80"
```

to the default mapping:

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
```

(or simply remove the ports section to use the internal network port 80). Save the file and run docker compose up – the network_setup milestone will then pass.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or incorrect references (missing files, wrong paths, unsupported commands).‑ Verify that the base image name/tag exists and can be pulled.‑ Make sure all files referenced in COPY/ADD are inside the build context.‑ Run the build with --no-cache to eliminate stale layers.‑ If the error mentions resources, increase Docker’s memory/CPU limits or add --shm-size if needed.‑ After correcting any of these issues, rebuild the image.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The services are not all exposed on their default external ports. While MySQL correctly maps the default MySQL port (3306:3306), phpMyAdmin maps container port 80 to host port 8080 and the httpd service maps container port 80 to host port 8000. These non‑default host ports mean the services are not accessible via their standard default ports, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
