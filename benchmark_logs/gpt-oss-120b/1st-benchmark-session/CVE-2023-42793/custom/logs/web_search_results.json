    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201142793 is a critical authentication\u2011bypass vulnerability in the JetBrains TeamCity on\u2011premises server. An unauthenticated attacker can issue specially crafted REST or XML\u2011RPC requests that create a valid authentication token for the default administrator (user id\u202f1). With this token the attacker gains full administrative privileges and can execute arbitrary commands on the TeamCity host and its build agents, steal source code, credentials and inject malicious artifacts into the CI/CD pipeline. The flaw resides in the core request\u2011interceptor logic that incorrectly excludes the \u201c/**/RPC2\u201d path from authentication checks, allowing token creation without any login. The vulnerability is present in all self\u2011hosted TeamCity versions released before build 2023.05.4. Exploitation was observed in the wild by nation\u2011state actors beginning in September\u202f2023, leading to remote code execution, persistence via scheduled tasks, DLL hijacking and lateral movement inside victim networks.",
