CVE description: CVE-2023-42793 is an authentication‑bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity on‑premises server. The flaw resides in TeamCity's request‑interceptor logic, which incorrectly disables authorization for certain REST API paths. An unauthenticated attacker can call the hidden token‑creation endpoint (e.g., /app/rest/users/id:1/tokens/RPC2) to obtain a valid token for the default admin account, then use that token to create new administrative users, execute builds, and ultimately run arbitrary code on the host. The vulnerability affects all TeamCity versions released before 2023.05.4. Exploitation requires only the base URL of the vulnerable server and no prior credentials. Successful exploitation grants full control over the CI/CD server, including access to source code, build agents, and any secrets stored within TeamCity. The flaw has been actively exploited in the wild by nation‑state actors, with observed post‑exploitation activity such as DLL‑search‑order hijacking, scheduled‑task persistence, and use of remote‑access tools.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetbrains/teamcity][['2023.05.3', '2023.05.2', '2023.05.1', '2023.04.5', '2023.04.4', '2023.04.3', '2023.04.2', '2023.04.1', '2023.03.6', '2023.03.5', '2023.03.4', '2023.03.3', '2023.03.2', '2023.03.1']] Core TeamCity server containing the vulnerable authentication logic. This service must be present for the CVE to be exploitable.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13.12']] TeamCity commonly uses PostgreSQL as its database backend. Required for a functional TeamCity installation but not directly related to the vulnerability.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.25.2']] Optional reverse‑proxy web server often placed in front of TeamCity. Needed to run the Docker stack but does not affect the vulnerability itself.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
