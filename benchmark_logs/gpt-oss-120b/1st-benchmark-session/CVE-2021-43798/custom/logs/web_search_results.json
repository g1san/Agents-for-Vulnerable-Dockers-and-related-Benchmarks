    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201143798 is a high\u2011severity directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Grafana version 8.x. The flaw resides in the public plugin asset endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId`. When a request contains sequences such as \"../\" (or URL\u2011encoded equivalents) the server concatenates the attacker\u2011controlled path to the plugin directory without proper sanitisation. As a result, an unauthenticated remote user can cause Grafana to read any file that the Grafana process can access on the host file system and return its contents in the HTTP response. This enables arbitrary file read, allowing the disclosure of sensitive data such as */etc/passwd*, the Grafana configuration file *grafana.ini*, and the SQLite database * /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db*. The disclosed database can be used to extract user credentials, API keys, and session tokens, potentially leading to further privilege escalation through plugin installation or arbitrary file write. The vulnerability affects all Grafana releases from 8.0.0\u2011beta1 through 8.3.0 that are not patched. Fixed releases are 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, and 8.3.1. Exploitation requires only a network\u2011reachable Grafana HTTP endpoint; no authentication or additional services are needed.",
