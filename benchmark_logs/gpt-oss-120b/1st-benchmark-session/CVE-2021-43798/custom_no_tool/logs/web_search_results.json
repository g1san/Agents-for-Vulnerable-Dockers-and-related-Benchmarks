    "desc": "Grafana versions from 8.0.0\u2011beta1 through 8.3.0 contain a flaw in the public plugin endpoint GET /public/plugins/:pluginId/* . The handler serves plugin asset files without sanitising the user\u2011supplied path, allowing an attacker to insert directory\u2011traversal sequences (../ or URL\u2011encoded %2e%2e/) and escape the plugin directory. By crafting a request such as GET /public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../etc/passwd the server resolves the path to the filesystem root and returns the contents of any file readable by the Grafana process. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, enabling arbitrary file read of configuration files, the SQLite database (data/grafana.db), system password files, SSH keys, logs, etc. Disclosure of these files can lead to credential harvesting, further privilege escalation, and potential remote code execution through write\u2011able paths discovered in the file system.",
