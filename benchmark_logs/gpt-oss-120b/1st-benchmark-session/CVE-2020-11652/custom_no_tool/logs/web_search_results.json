    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111652 is a remote code execution vulnerability in SaltStack Salt's master service. The flaw resides in the master\u2019s ClearFuncs implementation, which fails to properly sanitize incoming request data and does not enforce a whitelist of callable methods. An unauthenticated attacker (or an attacker with a valid token when the master is configured to allow unauthenticated publishers) can send specially crafted payloads to the master\u2019s publish/execution API (default TCP ports 4505 and 4506). The master will execute arbitrary internal functions, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the master itself or on any connected minion, read or write arbitrary files, and ultimately obtain full control of the Salt environment. The vulnerability affects SaltStack Salt versions prior to the patches released in 2019.2.4, 3000.2 and later releases of the 3000 series.",
