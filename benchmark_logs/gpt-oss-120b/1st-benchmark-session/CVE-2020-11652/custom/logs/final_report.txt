CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11652 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt master service. The flaw resides in the Salt master’s execution pathway (wheel and execution modules as well as the file_roots.write function) where user‑controlled arguments are not properly sanitized. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the Salt master’s network ports (4505/4506 for the ZeroMQ interface or the salt‑api HTTP endpoint) can invoke these modules to perform directory‑traversal and arbitrary file‑write operations, which in turn allow the execution of any operating‑system command on the master host. Because the Salt master typically runs as the root user, the attacker obtains full system compromise, can read or overwrite any file, schedule cron jobs, or execute commands on connected minions. The vulnerability affects all Salt releases prior to version 2019.2.4 and prior to version 3000.2. Exploits demonstrated in public proof‑of‑concept code show the ability to issue commands such as `whoami`, open a reverse shell, read `/etc/passwd`, and write files to privileged locations using path‑traversal payloads. Mitigation requires upgrading to a fixed Salt version and restricting network access to the master’s ports.
Attack Type: Remote command execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The Salt master container provides the vulnerable SaltStack service. It runs the master process that contains the ClearFuncs/ wheel and execution modules which are exploited by CVE‑2020‑11652.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Check the container’s logs (`docker logs <container>`). Look for error messages or crashes. If the logs show a missing file, dependency, or permission issue, correct it in the image or bind‑mount the required resource.  

If the container exits immediately, run it interactively (`docker run -it --rm <image> /bin/sh`) to inspect the filesystem and environment variables.  

Common fixes:  

* Rebuild the image after updating the Dockerfile or fixing broken commands.  
* Ensure required ports, volumes, and environment variables are supplied (`-p`, `-v`, `-e`).  
* Verify the base image is compatible with the host kernel (e.g., no unsupported syscalls).  
* Clear stale state (`docker system prune -f`) and recreate the container.  

After applying the fix, start the container again (`docker start <container>`). If it still fails, share the specific error output for deeper analysis.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: 1. Check container status  
   `docker ps -a | grep <container_name>`  

2. View recent logs for clues  
   `docker logs <container_name> --tail 20`  

3. If the container exited, try a clean restart  
   `docker restart <container_name>`  

4. If it still fails, inspect for misconfigurations  
   `docker inspect <container_name>` – look at environment vars, mounts, ports, and exit code.  

5. Common fixes:  
   • Correct any wrong environment variable values.  
   • Ensure required host directories/files exist and have proper permissions.  
   • Verify that required ports are not already in use on the host.  

6. Rebuild the image if the problem is inside the build (e.g., missing dependencies):  
   `docker build -t <image_name> <Dockerfile_dir>`  
   then recreate the container:  
   `docker rm -f <container_name>`  
   `docker run -d --name <container_name> <run_options> <image_name>`  

7. If the issue persists, check host resources (CPU, memory, disk) and Docker daemon logs:  
   `systemctl status docker` and `journalctl -u docker`  

Apply the step where the error appears; most container start‑up problems are resolved by correcting env settings, mounts, or rebuilding the image.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: 1. Check the container’s status: `docker ps -a` and locate the failing container’s name or ID.  
2. View its recent logs to see the error: `docker logs <container_id_or_name>`.  
3. If the logs show a missing file, wrong env var, or crashed process, correct the Dockerfile or the `docker run` command (add the needed volume, set the correct `ENV` variables, or adjust the `CMD`).  
4. Recreate the container with the fixed configuration:  
   ```
   docker rm <container_id_or_name>
   docker run [options] <image>
   ```  
5. If the issue persists, inspect the container’s health check and ensure required dependencies (e.g., network, mounted volumes) are available.  
6. After adjustments, start the container and verify it runs: `docker start <container_id_or_name>` and `docker ps`.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines two services: 'dind' based on the image 'docker:23.0-dind' and 'vulnerable_app' built from a Python 3.8 slim base. Neither service uses the 'saltstack/salt' image, and consequently no version from the listed vulnerable SaltStack versions is present. Therefore the required service 'saltstack/salt' is missing (services_ok = false) and no vulnerable version of that service is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines two services: 'dind' based on the image 'docker:23.0-dind' and 'vulnerable_app' built from a Python 3.8 slim base. Neither service uses the 'saltstack/salt' image, and consequently no version from the listed vulnerable SaltStack versions is present. Therefore the required service 'saltstack/salt' is missing (services_ok = false) and no vulnerable version of that service is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: Add a saltstack/salt service to the compose file (or include the image in an existing service) with a supported, non‑vulnerable tag (e.g., saltstack/salt:3006.5). Then set services_ok to true by referencing this service in any depends_on or network links. Ensure the version you choose is not in the known vulnerable list. Finally, rebuild/re‑deploy the stack so the new service starts.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the build output to see the exact error line, then:

1. Open the Dockerfile and correct any syntax mistakes (misspelled commands, wrong flags, missing backslashes).
2. Verify that the base image name and tag exist and can be pulled (`docker pull <image>:<tag>`).
3. Ensure all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) are present in the build context and have the right permissions.
4. If a RUN step fails, run the same command interactively in a temporary container to debug (`docker run -it --rm <base> /bin/sh`), fix missing packages or environment variables, and update the Dockerfile.
5. Clear any stale cache that might hide the fix (`docker builder prune` or build with `--no-cache`).
6. Re‑run the build: `docker build -t myimage .` and confirm it completes.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing commands. Make sure the base image name and tag are correct and still available. Verify that every RUN, COPY, or ADD instruction refers to existing files or directories inside the build context. If you’re installing packages, update the package index first (e.g., apt‑get update or apk update) and use the correct package names. Remove any stray spaces, backslashes, or line‑continuation characters that could break the parser. Run docker build with --no-cache to force a clean build and see the exact failure line. Fix the offending line, then rebuild.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file uses the image saltstack/salt:3006.5. The list of vulnerable versions for saltstack/salt is ['2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']; version 3006.5 is not among them, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The required service 'saltstack/salt' is present in the compose configuration, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- ERROR: The compose file uses the image saltstack/salt:3006.5. The list of vulnerable versions for saltstack/salt is ['2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']; version 3006.5 is not among them, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The required service 'saltstack/salt' is present in the compose configuration, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: Update the compose file to use a vulnerable SaltStack image tag from the list, e.g.:

services:
  salt:
    image: saltstack/salt:3000.1

This change makes the version match the “code_hard_version” requirement while the required service remains present, satisfying both milestones.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The vulnerable_app service maps host port 8080 to the container's port 80, which is not the default port configuration (the container exposes port 80 but the host port is remapped to 8080). All other services (dind on 2375 and salt on 4505/4506) use their default ports, but the mismatch for vulnerable_app causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The vulnerable_app service maps host port 8080 to the container's port 80, which is not the default port configuration (the container exposes port 80 but the host port is remapped to 8080). All other services (dind on 2375 and salt on 4505/4506) use their default ports, but the mismatch for vulnerable_app causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Modify the Compose (or Docker run) definition for vulnerable_app so the host port matches the container’s exposed port. For example:

```yaml
services:
  vulnerable_app:
    ports:
      - "80:80"   # host 80 → container 80
```

or, if you must keep host 8080, update the network_setup configuration to target 8080 instead of the default 80. Either change the port mapping to “80:80” or adjust the dependent service to use the actual mapped port.
