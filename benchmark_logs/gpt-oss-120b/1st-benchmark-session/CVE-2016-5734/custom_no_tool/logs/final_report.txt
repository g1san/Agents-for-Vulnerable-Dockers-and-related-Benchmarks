CVE description: CVE‑2016‑5734 is a remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyAdmin’s table “search and replace” feature. The feature builds a regular‑expression pattern for PHP's preg_replace() without properly handling delimiters, which allows an attacker to inject the eval (e) modifier into the pattern. When a crafted input containing a null‑byte terminator and the e‑modifier is supplied, preg_replace() evaluates attacker‑controlled PHP code. The flaw is present in phpMyAdmin releases prior to the patches: 4.0.10.16, 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.3. An unauthenticated (or authenticated, depending on the instance configuration) remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the phpMyAdmin web interface and achieve arbitrary command execution on the server, leading to full compromise of the host running phpMyAdmin.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then:

1. Verify the base image name and tag are correct and available.
2. Ensure all COPY/ADD source paths exist relative to the build context.
3. Remove any stray spaces or line‑continuation characters (\\) that break commands.
4. Run the build with --no-cache to force a clean rebuild and see the exact failing step.
5. If a specific command fails, simplify it (e.g., split a long RUN into separate lines) and test the command manually inside a temporary container of the base image.

Fix the identified issue and rerun docker build.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only a PHP (php:5.6-apache) service and a MySQL (mysql:5.5) service. It does not include the phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin service, which is required for the services_ok milestone. Consequently services_ok is false. Since phpmyadmin is absent, no vulnerable phpmyadmin version from the provided list is used, so code_hard_version is false.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only a PHP (php:5.6-apache) service and a MySQL (mysql:5.5) service. It does not include the phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin service, which is required for the services_ok milestone. Consequently services_ok is false. Since phpmyadmin is absent, no vulnerable phpmyadmin version from the provided list is used, so code_hard_version is false.
	- FIX: Add a phpmyadmin service to the docker‑compose.yml and point it at the MySQL container. Example:

services:
  php:
    image: php:5.6-apache
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: mysql:5.5
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:4.7.0   # pick a version from the vulnerable list
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: db
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    depends_on:
      - db

After adding the service, run docker‑compose up -d . “services_ok” will become true and, because the specified phpmyadmin image matches a vulnerable version, “code_hard_version” will also be true.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Examine the build output to locate the exact error line.  
2. Verify the Dockerfile syntax at that line – common issues are missing back‑slashes, incorrect instruction order, or stray characters.  
3. Ensure the referenced base image exists and can be pulled (run `docker pull <base‑image>`).  
4. Check that any files or directories copied into the image (`COPY`/`ADD`) actually exist in the build context and have proper permissions.  
5. If the error is from a RUN command, test the command manually inside a temporary container (`docker run -it <base‑image> /bin/sh`) to confirm it works.  
6. Resolve missing dependencies or package manager errors (e.g., update apt caches, install required packages).  
7. After fixing, rebuild with `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .` to ensure a clean build.  
If the problem persists, share the specific error message for a more targeted fix.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or unsupported commands.  
1. Run `docker build .` with `--no-cache` to see the exact failing step.  
2. Verify that all referenced files (COPY/ADD sources) exist and have correct paths.  
3. Ensure base‑image name and tag are correct and available.  
4. If a RUN command fails, run the same command interactively in a container from the base image to debug missing dependencies or permissions.  
5. Update the Dockerfile to install required packages, set proper user permissions, or adjust file paths, then rebuild.  

If the error persists, post the specific error line for more targeted help.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or invalid commands, then run docker build with the --no-cache flag to force a clean rebuild. Make sure all referenced files exist in the build context and that any required build‑args are supplied. Verify that the base image name and tag are correct and still available. If the error persists, examine the exact build output to pinpoint the failing step and adjust that instruction accordingly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run the build with full logs: `docker build -t myimage . --progress=plain` to see the exact error line.  
2. Verify the Dockerfile syntax at the reported line (common issues: missing back‑slash, wrong instruction order, unsupported flags).  
3. Ensure the base image name/tag exists and is reachable (`docker pull <base>`).  
4. Check that every file referenced by `COPY`/`ADD` actually exists in the build context and has correct permissions.  
5. If a RUN step fails, open an interactive shell in a temporary container from the same base image (`docker run -it <base> /bin/sh`) and execute the offending commands manually to see missing packages or path problems.  
6. Install any required packages or adjust commands, then retry the build.  
7. When changes are made, rebuild with `docker build --no-cache -t myimage .` to avoid using cached layers that may still contain the error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run the build with verbose output to see the exact error:  
   `docker build --progress=plain -t myimage .`

2. Common fixes based on typical failures:  

   - **Invalid instruction or syntax** – open the Dockerfile, correct misspelled Dockerfile commands (e.g., `RUN`, `COPY`, `FROM`).  
   - **Missing base image** – verify the image name/tag after `FROM`; pull it manually (`docker pull <image>`) or use a fully‑qualified registry path.  
   - **File not found in COPY/ADD** – ensure the source path exists relative to the build context and is not excluded by `.dockerignore`.  
   - **Permission problems** – add `USER root` before commands that need elevated rights, or adjust file permissions with `chmod/chown` in a `RUN` step.  
   - **Package install failures** – update the package index first (`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>`), and clean up caches (`rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`).  

3. Clear any corrupted cache and retry:  
   `docker builder prune -af`  
   `docker build -t myimage .`

4. If the error persists, isolate the failing layer by commenting out later Dockerfile sections, rebuild, and re‑introduce them one by one.

Apply the relevant fix, then rebuild the image. This usually resolves termination errors during Docker image builds.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: 1. Run the build with full logs to see the exact error:  
   `docker build -t myimage . --no-cache --progress=plain`

2. Look at the line reported in the log. Common fixes:  

   - **Syntax errors** – ensure each instruction is on its own line, no stray characters.  
   - **Missing files** – verify `COPY`/`ADD` source paths exist relative to the Dockerfile.  
   - **Incorrect base image** – pull the correct tag: `docker pull <base>` and reference it exactly.  
   - **Package install failures** – add required repositories, update apt/yum first, and use `--no-install-recommends` or clean up caches to avoid space issues.  

3. If the error is “layer exceeds size limit” or “out of space”, clean the builder environment:  
   `docker system prune -a --volumes`  

4. Re‑run the build after applying the fix. If it still fails, share the specific error line for deeper analysis.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing files, then:

1. Run `docker build` with `--no-cache` to see the exact failing step.
2. Verify all `COPY`/`ADD` source paths exist relative to the build context.
3. Ensure any required build‑time packages are installed before they’re used (e.g., `apt-get update && apt-get install -y …` in the same RUN line).
4. If a command fails, add `set -e` or `&&` chaining so the build stops at the right point and you can see the error output.
5. Look for mismatched parentheses, quotes, or line‑continuation `\` characters.
6. Confirm base image name/tag is correct and can be pulled.
7. After fixing the offending line, run `docker build .` again.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
