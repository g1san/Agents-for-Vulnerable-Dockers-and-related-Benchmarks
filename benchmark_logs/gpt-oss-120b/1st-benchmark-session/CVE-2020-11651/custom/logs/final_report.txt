CVE description: CVE-2020-11651 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt master service. The vulnerability resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the salt-master process in Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000 versions prior to 3000.2. The master accepts unauthenticated requests over its Zero‑MQ (port 4506) or REST API interface and fails to properly validate method calls. An attacker who can reach the master can retrieve the master’s root AES authentication key, read or write arbitrary files on the master, execute arbitrary commands on the master itself, and broadcast commands to all connected minions. This results in full remote code execution and complete compromise of the Salt infrastructure and any managed systems.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000.0', '3000.1']] The vulnerable Salt master service. Versions listed are directly affected by CVE-2020-11651 and provide the Zero‑MQ RPC interface that can be abused to extract the master key and execute arbitrary commands.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines a single service 'vulnerable' that uses the image nginx:1.19. None of the inspected images include the required service 'saltstack/salt', and no image tagged with any of the listed vulnerable saltstack/salt versions (2019.2.0, 2019.2.1, 2019.2.2, 2019.2.3, 3000.0, 3000.1) is present. Hence the Docker setup does not use a vulnerable 'HARD' service version and also does not include the required 'saltstack/salt' service, causing both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines a single service 'vulnerable' that uses the image nginx:1.19. None of the inspected images include the required service 'saltstack/salt', and no image tagged with any of the listed vulnerable saltstack/salt versions (2019.2.0, 2019.2.1, 2019.2.2, 2019.2.3, 3000.0, 3000.1) is present. Hence the Docker setup does not use a vulnerable 'HARD' service version and also does not include the required 'saltstack/salt' service, causing both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: Add a new service that uses one of the vulnerable SaltStack images and keep the existing nginx service.  

Example docker‑compose.yml:

```
version: "3.8"

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  salt:
    image: saltstack/salt:2019.2.0   # or 2019.2.1‑2019.2.3, 3000.0, 3000.1
    container_name: salt
    ports:
      - "4505:4505"
      - "4506:4506"
    environment:
      - SALT_MASTER=yes
```

1. Insert the `salt` service block beneath the existing `nginx` service.  
2. Choose any of the listed vulnerable tags for the `image` field.  
3. Run `docker compose up -d` to start both containers.  

Now the compose file contains the required `saltstack/salt` service with a vulnerable version, satisfying the milestones.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
