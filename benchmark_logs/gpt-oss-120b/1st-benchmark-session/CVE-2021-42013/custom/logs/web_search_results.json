    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201142013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The flaw arises from an incomplete fix for a previous path\u2011traversal issue (CVE\u20112021\u201141773). An attacker can craft specially\u2011encoded requests that bypass Alias, ScriptAlias, Redirect and similar directives, causing the server to map the request to files outside the intended document\u2011root. When the traversed path reaches a location where CGI scripts or other executable handlers are enabled, the attacker can cause those scripts to run, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability requires the server to have CGI\u2011BIN enabled, an Alias entry pointing to a writable location (commonly the \"icons\" directory), and a permissive <Directory> configuration such as \"Require all granted\". Exploitation is network\u2011reachable, requires no authentication, and can be performed with low effort. The vulnerability can be demonstrated by sending a request containing \"../\" sequences that traverse out of the aliased directory, reading arbitrary files or triggering execution of attacker\u2011controlled code. Mitigation is to upgrade Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.51 or later, or to enforce strict access controls (e.g., \"Require all denied\") on directories reachable via traversal.",
