    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201142013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The flaw allows an attacker to bypass directory restrictions imposed by Alias\u2011type directives (such as Alias or ScriptAlias). By sending specially crafted path\u2011traversal requests (e.g., \"../../../../etc/passwd\"), the server maps the URL to files outside the intended directory, leading to arbitrary file disclosure. If the traversed location contains CGI scripts and the CGI\u2011BIN is enabled, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands, resulting in remote code execution. The vulnerability is exploitable over the network without authentication or user interaction. It does not affect earlier Apache HTTP Server releases.",
