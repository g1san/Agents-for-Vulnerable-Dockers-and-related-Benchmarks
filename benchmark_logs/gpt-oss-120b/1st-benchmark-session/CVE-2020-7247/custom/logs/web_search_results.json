    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u20117247 is a critical vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The flaw resides in the function that processes the SMTP MAIL FROM command. When the server validates the address, it can return an incorrect value if the input does not meet the expected format. The attacker can embed shell metacharacters in the MAIL FROM argument; these characters are later concatenated into the command line that invokes the local mail delivery agent (mail.local). Because the string is not properly escaped, the malicious payload is executed by the operating system shell. The OpenSMTPD daemon typically runs with root privileges, so the injected command is executed with full system authority, granting the attacker complete remote command execution on the host. The vulnerability is present in all OpenSMTPD releases older than version 6.6.2, i.e., the code base before the security\u2011fix commit a8e222352f. Exploitation requires only network access to the SMTP port (usually TCP 25) and does not need authentication or any additional services. An attacker can connect with a simple telnet client or an automated script, send a crafted MAIL FROM line, and cause the daemon to run arbitrary commands, such as a reverse shell, leading to full system compromise.",
