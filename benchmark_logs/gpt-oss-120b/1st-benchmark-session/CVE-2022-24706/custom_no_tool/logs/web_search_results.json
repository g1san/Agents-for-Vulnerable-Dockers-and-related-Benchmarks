    "desc": "Apache CouchDB contains a critical vulnerability in its default installation that exposes the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) on TCP port 4369 and a randomly assigned Erlang distribution port bound to all network interfaces. The installer ships with a static default Erlang cookie value \"monster\". An unauthenticated attacker who can reach these ports can use the default cookie to authenticate to the Erlang node, issue remote procedure calls that invoke the Erlang function os:cmd/1, and therefore execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the CouchDB process. This results in full administrative control of the database and potential complete system compromise. The flaw is present in all CouchDB releases up to and including version 3.2.1. Versions 3.2.2 and later reject the default cookie and bind the Erlang ports to localhost only, mitigating the issue.",
