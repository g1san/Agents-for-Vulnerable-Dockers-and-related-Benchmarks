    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201124706 affects Apache CouchDB versions up to and including 3.2.1. The vulnerability stems from the default installation exposing the Erlang distribution port and the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) on all network interfaces while using a hard\u2011coded default Erlang cookie value \u201cmonster\u201d. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach epmd (TCP port 4369) and the randomly assigned distribution port can authenticate using the known cookie, establish a distributed Erlang connection to the CouchDB node, and then invoke Erlang commands such as os:cmd/1. This grants the attacker full administrative rights to the CouchDB HTTP API and the ability to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host, effectively a remote code execution and privilege escalation scenario.",
