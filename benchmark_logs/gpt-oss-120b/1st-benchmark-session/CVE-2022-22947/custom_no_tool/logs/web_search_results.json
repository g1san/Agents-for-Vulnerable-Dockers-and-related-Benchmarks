    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201122947 is a critical code\u2011injection vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway. The flaw resides in the Gateway Actuator endpoint (\\/actuator\\/gateway) which, when enabled, exposed to the network and left without authentication, accepts route definitions containing unfiltered Spring Expression Language (SpEL) values. An attacker can craft a JSON payload that injects malicious SpEL into the \\\"filters.args.value\\\" field of a route definition. When the gateway refreshes the routes, the injected SpEL is evaluated with the privileges of the gateway process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host. This results in full remote code execution with a CVSS score of 9.8 (critical). The vulnerability affects all Spring Cloud Gateway releases prior to 3.0.7 and 3.1.1. Exploitation requires only network access to the actuator endpoint and the ability to send HTTP POST requests; no authentication or prior access is needed.",
