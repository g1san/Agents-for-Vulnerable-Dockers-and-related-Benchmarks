CVE description: CVE‑2021‑42013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The flaw is caused by incomplete fixing of a previous path‑traversal issue. When the server has the CGI module enabled and an Alias or ScriptAlias directive that points to a writable directory without the default \"Require all denied\" restriction, an attacker can send specially crafted URLs containing encoded "../" sequences (e.g., ".%2e/.%2e/.../etc/passwd"). This bypasses normal path sanitisation, allowing the request to be mapped to files outside the intended directory. If the traversed location contains a CGI script, the server will execute the attacker‑controlled script, resulting in remote code execution. The attack requires no authentication, can be performed remotely over HTTP, and runs with the privileges of the Apache process.
Attack Type: path traversal and remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49', '2.4.50']] Apache HTTP Server implementation that contains the vulnerable code path. The container must be built with CGI enabled and an Alias (e.g., for "icons") that is configured with "Require all granted" to reproduce the vulnerability.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base *httpd:2.4.49* image you’re using is the Alpine variant, which doesn’t provide the Debian‑style `apt-get` tooling that the Dockerfile expects; the `RUN apt‑get …` step therefore crashes. Switch the base to the Debian‑based tag (for example `FROM httpd:2.4.49-bullseye`) or replace the package‑install line with Alpine’s package manager (`apk add perl`). After that change the rest of the Dockerfile (the `COPY` commands and the `chmod` on the CGI script) will execute without error, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base image tag you’re pulling (`httpd:2.4.49‑bullseye`) does not exist in Docker Hub, so Docker can’t resolve the FROM line; change it to a valid tag such as `httpd:2.4.49` (or any officially‑published 2.4.49 variant) and the rest of the Dockerfile will run correctly. After fixing the FROM line you can keep the existing apt‑get install and chmod steps unchanged, and the image will build without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to copy files from paths that don’t exist relative to the Docker context (the COPY commands for ./conf/httpd.conf, ./htdocs/ and ./cgi-bin/ are wrong) and then attempts to chmod a script that was never copied. To fix it, adjust the COPY lines so they reference the correct directories inside the build context (for example, copy conf/httpd.conf instead of ./conf/httpd.conf, and likewise for the htdocs and cgi‑bin folders), or move the Dockerfile into the same directory that contains those subfolders and reference them without the leading ./. After correcting the source paths, the chmod step will succeed because vuln.cgi will actually be present in /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/. This simple path correction resolves the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the image is trying to copy files from a path that doesn’t exist in the build context and the CGI module isn’t fully enabled in the Apache configuration. To fix it, I would adjust the Dockerfile so it uses the correct relative paths (e.g., `COPY ./custom/conf/httpd.conf …` and `COPY ./custom/htdocs/ …` when the build context is set to the `custom` directory) and ensure the CGI module is loaded before the script directory is defined. I’d also add a `RUN a2enmod cgi` (or the equivalent `LoadModule cgi_module …` line) and set the proper permissions on the script after copying, then rebuild the image. This aligns the file locations with the Docker build context and guarantees the CGI handler is active, eliminating the build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base httpd:2.4.49 image you are using is the Alpine‑based variant, which does not provide apt‑get and therefore the “apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y perl” line errors out. To fix it, either switch the base image to a Debian‑based tag (for example httpd:2.4.49‑bullseye) so the apt commands work, or replace the apt‑get line with the Alpine package manager syntax ( apk add --no‑cache perl ). After correcting the package‑install command the rest of the Dockerfile – copying the configuration, the web files and making the CGI executable – will build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile is trying to copy files from paths that don’t exist relative to the build context you’ve set in the compose file. Change the compose service to use the custom directory as its build context (for example, build: ./custom) and then adjust the Dockerfile COPY statements to refer to the files directly (e.g., COPY conf/httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf, COPY htdocs/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/, COPY cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/). With the correct context and paths, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the base httpd:2.4.49 image you’re pulling is the Alpine‑based variant, which doesn’t provide the `apt‑get` command used to install Perl; thus the `RUN apt‑get …` step aborts the build. To fix it, either switch the base image to the Debian‑based tag (for example `FROM httpd:2.4.49-bullseye`) so that `apt‑get` works, or replace the `apt‑get` line with the Alpine package manager (`apk add --no-cache perl`). After the package install succeeds, the rest of the Dockerfile (copying the config, htdocs and cgi‑bin directories and setting the executable bit on `vuln.cgi`) will build without error. In short, adjust the base image or the package‑installation command so the Perl interpreter can be installed in the container.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile’s COPY paths are relative to the build context, not to the source tree location shown, so the configuration and web‑files aren’t found. I would change the Dockerfile to use the paths that exist inside the context (for example COPY conf/httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/ and COPY htdocs/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ and COPY cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/), add an EXPOSE 80 line so the port is declared, and keep the chmod +x command for the CGI script. Those small adjustments ensure all files are copied correctly and the image builds without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to copy files from paths that don’t exist relative to its location, so the COPY commands can’t find the conf/httpd.conf, htdocs and cgi-bin directories. To fix it, move the Dockerfile into the directory that contains the conf, htdocs and cgi-bin folders (or adjust the COPY source paths to point to the correct relative locations), then make sure the cgi-bin directory is created before you chmod the script (for example by adding RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin before the chmod line). After correcting the copy paths and ensuring the target directories exist, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
