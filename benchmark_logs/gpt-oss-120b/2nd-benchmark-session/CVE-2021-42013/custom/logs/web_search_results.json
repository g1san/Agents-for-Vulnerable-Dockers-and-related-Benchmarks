    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201142013 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The flaw is caused by incomplete fixing of a previous path\u2011traversal issue. When the server has the CGI module enabled and an Alias or ScriptAlias directive that points to a writable directory without the default \\\"Require all denied\\\" restriction, an attacker can send specially crafted URLs containing encoded \"../\" sequences (e.g., \".%2e/.%2e/.../etc/passwd\"). This bypasses normal path sanitisation, allowing the request to be mapped to files outside the intended directory. If the traversed location contains a CGI script, the server will execute the attacker\u2011controlled script, resulting in remote code execution. The attack requires no authentication, can be performed remotely over HTTP, and runs with the privileges of the Apache process.",
