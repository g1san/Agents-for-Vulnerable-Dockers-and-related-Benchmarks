    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201142013 is a critical path\u2011traversal and remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. The flaw exists in the mod_proxy module and in the handling of Alias\u2011like directives (such as ProxyPass, Alias, and ScriptAlias) where URL\u2011encoded sequences are not properly validated. An attacker who can send a request to a vulnerable Apache instance with proxy functionality enabled can craft specially encoded URLs (e.g., using \"..%2f\" or other encoded traversal sequences) that bypass the normal security checks. This allows the attacker to read files outside the intended document root (path\u2011traversal) and, when CGI scripts or other executable handlers are present in the traversed location, to execute arbitrary commands on the server (remote code execution). The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. It is fixed starting with version 2.4.51. Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, data leakage, and lateral movement within the network.",
