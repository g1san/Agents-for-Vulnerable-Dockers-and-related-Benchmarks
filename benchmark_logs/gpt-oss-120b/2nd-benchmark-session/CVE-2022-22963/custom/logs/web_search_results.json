{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201122963 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function's routing functionality. The component accepts a header called `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` whose value is interpreted as a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) string. The expression is evaluated inside a `StandardEvaluationContext` without any validation, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious SpEL payload. By supplying a crafted payload such as `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('\u2026')` in the header, the attacker can cause the vulnerable application to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host container. The flaw exists in Spring Cloud Function version 3.1.6, version 3.2.2, and any earlier, unsupported releases. Successful exploitation gives an attacker full control over the host, exposing all data and resources. The vulnerability is network reachable, requires no authentication, and has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (critical). Mitigation requires upgrading to Spring Cloud Function version 3.1.7, 3.2.3, or any later release that hardens the routing\u2011expression handling.",
