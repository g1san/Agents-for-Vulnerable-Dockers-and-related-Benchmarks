    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201122963 is a critical vulnerability in the routing functionality of Spring Cloud Function. The component evaluates the value of the HTTP header `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` as a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) string without proper validation. An attacker can supply a malicious SpEL payload that is executed in a StandardEvaluationContext, allowing arbitrary OS commands to be run inside the JVM. This results in full remote code execution on the host/container, giving the attacker complete control over confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system. The vulnerability affects Spring Cloud Function version 3.1.6, version 3.2.2 and all earlier, unsupported releases.",
