CVE description: CVE‑2023‑23752 is an unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability affecting the Joomla! content‑management system. The flaw resides in Joomla! core web‑service and installation endpoints where an improper access‑control check fails to verify a user's permissions. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to URLs such as `/installation/index.php`, `/api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true`, or other publicly accessible XML/JSON endpoints and receive internal configuration data. The disclosed information includes the full Joomla! configuration, site version, and, most critically, the plaintext MySQL database credentials (host, username, password, database name). Because no authentication is required, any remote user can retrieve this data. The leaked database credentials can be used to directly connect to the MySQL server (if it is reachable) and further compromise the site, for example by modifying the users table or installing malicious extensions. The vulnerability is present in all Joomla! 4 releases from version 4.0.0 up to and including version 4.2.7. It was corrected in Joomla! 4.2.8, where proper access checks were added to the web‑service and installation routes. Mitigation consists of upgrading Joomla! to 4.2.8 or later, restricting access to the installation directory after setup, disabling public API endpoints, and rotating any exposed database credentials.
