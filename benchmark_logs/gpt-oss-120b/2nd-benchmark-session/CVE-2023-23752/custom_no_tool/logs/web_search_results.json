    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201123752 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Joomla! 4 core. The flaw is an improper access\u2011control check on internal web\u2011service API endpoints, allowing unauthenticated users to retrieve sensitive configuration data (including plaintext MySQL credentials) and user information. The disclosed data can be used to gain database access or to log in as a Super User, after which an attacker can upload malicious PHP files or install harmful extensions, achieving remote code execution as the web\u2011server user.",
