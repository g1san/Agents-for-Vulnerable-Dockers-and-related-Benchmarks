{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server that affects the way the server normalizes request URIs. In the default compliance mode Jetty decodes percent\u2011encoded characters before normalizing the path. This allows specially crafted URIs that contain encoded dot segments (e.g., %2e for \".\" or %u002e for Unicode dot) or null bytes (%00) to bypass the normal path\u2011normalization checks that protect the WEB\u2011INF directory. An attacker can send a request such as `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` or `/context/%u002e/WEB-INF/web.xml` and cause Jetty to serve files that are supposed to be inaccessible, revealing internal configuration files, deployment descriptors, and potentially credentials. The flaw does not require authentication, user interaction, or special privileges; it is exploitable over the network by any client that can reach the Jetty service. The impact is the disclosure of sensitive files located under WEB\u2011INF, which may lead to further attacks based on the information obtained. The vulnerability is classified as an information disclosure issue with a moderate CVSS score. The issue was reported by CloverSec Labs and has been addressed in later Jetty releases that restore the correct order of decoding and normalization or provide stricter compliance modes.",
