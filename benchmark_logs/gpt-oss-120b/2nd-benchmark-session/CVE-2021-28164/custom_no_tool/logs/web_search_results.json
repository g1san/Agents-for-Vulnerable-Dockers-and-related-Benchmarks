    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server. The server's default compliance mode decodes URI paths after normalization, allowing specially crafted percent\u2011encoded dot segments (e.g., \"%2e\" for \".\" or \"%2e%2e\" for \"..\") to bypass security checks. An attacker can request a URL such as \"/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml\" and cause Jetty to serve files located inside the protected WEB\u2011INF directory. This results in the disclosure of sensitive application configuration files, source code references, and other confidential data. The flaw affects multiple Jetty releases and is classified as an information disclosure vulnerability.",
