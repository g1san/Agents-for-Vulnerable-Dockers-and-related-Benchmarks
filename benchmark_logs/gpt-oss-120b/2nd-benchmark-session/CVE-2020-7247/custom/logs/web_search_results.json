    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u20117247 is a vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The flaw resides in the smtp_mailaddr() function that parses the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO SMTP commands. Improper validation of user\u2011controlled input allows an attacker to inject shell meta\u2011characters (such as ;, |, or backticks) into the address field. Because OpenSMTPD typically runs as root, these injected commands are executed with full system privileges, giving an unauthenticated remote attacker the ability to run arbitrary commands on the affected host. The vulnerability is present in all OpenSMTPD releases after commit a8e222352f and before the introduction of version 6.6.2, which contains the fix for the input\u2011escaping bug. Exploitation requires only network access to the SMTP service; no authentication is needed. Successful exploitation results in complete remote code execution on the target system.",
