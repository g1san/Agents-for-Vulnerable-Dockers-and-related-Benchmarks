----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2020‑7247 is a vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The flaw resides in the smtp_mailaddr() function that parses the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO SMTP commands. Improper validation of user‑controlled input allows an attacker to inject shell meta‑characters (such as ;, |, or backticks) into the address field. Because OpenSMTPD typically runs as root, these injected commands are executed with full system privileges, giving an unauthenticated remote attacker the ability to run arbitrary commands on the affected host. The vulnerability is present in all OpenSMTPD releases after commit a8e222352f and before the introduction of version 6.6.2, which contains the fix for the input‑escaping bug. Exploitation requires only network access to the SMTP service; no authentication is needed. Successful exploitation results in complete remote code execution on the target system.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd/opensmtpd][['5.9', '6.4', '6.5', '6.6', '6.6.0', '6.6.1']] OpenSMTPD daemon containing the vulnerable code path; required to demonstrate CVE‑2020‑7247.
- [SOFT][alpine][['3.18']] Base operating system image used to run the OpenSMTPD container; needed for Docker to function.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration builds the image from a Python 3.9 slim base image and does not include the 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' service at any of the specified versions. Additionally, the image is not based on 'alpine' and does not use the 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' service at all, so the required services list ['opensmtpd/opensmtpd', 'alpine'] is not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration builds the image from a Python 3.9 slim base image and does not include the 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' service at any of the specified versions. Additionally, the image is not based on 'alpine' and does not use the 'opensmtpd/opensmtpd' service at all, so the required services list ['opensmtpd/opensmtpd', 'alpine'] is not satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services you need to add an OpenSMTPD container based on an Alpine image and connect it to the Flask app, so the compose file should include a second service that pulls alpine and installs opensmtpd (e.g. apk add opensmtpd), exposing its SMTP port. The Flask service’s Dockerfile can be changed to use python:3.9‑alpine instead of the slim variant, which already provides the Alpine base, and you should remove the mounting of the Docker socket unless it is explicitly needed. Finally, update the docker‑compose.yml to list both services (the vulnerable Flask app and the OpenSMTPD service) so the dependency list ['opensmtpd/opensmtpd','alpine'] is fulfilled.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Python image does not have the compiler and system headers required to compile some of the wheel dependencies pulled in by pip, so the “pip install” step aborts. Adding the Alpine build tools before the pip command (for example, installing build-base and libffi-dev with apk add) and then removing them after the packages are compiled resolves the issue; alternatively, switching the base image to a Debian‑based Python variant (e.g., python:3.9‑slim) eliminates the need for extra build packages altogether. After installing the necessary build dependencies (or changing the base image) the Dockerfile will complete successfully and the container will start as intended.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image does not put the OpenSMTPD binary in the default PATH, so the `CMD ["opensmtpd", "-d"]` line can’t find the executable. Fix it by installing the package and then invoking the binary with its full path (or by adding its directory to PATH). For example, change the `smtp/Dockerfile` to:

```
FROM alpine:3.18
RUN apk add --no-cache opensmtpd && \
    ln -sf /usr/sbin/opensmtpd /usr/local/bin/opensmtpd   # optional shortcut
CMD ["/usr/sbin/opensmtpd","-d"]
```

or simply prepend the full path in the Docker‑Compose command. After this change the image builds successfully and the rest of the configuration can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the OpenSMTPD image exits immediately – the package is installed but no configuration file is provided, so the daemon can’t start. To fix it, add a minimal `opensmtpd.conf` (for example one that just accepts all mail) to the image and copy it into `/etc/opensmtpd/opensmtpd.conf` during the Dockerfile build; you can do this with a `RUN echo "listen on *" > /etc/opensmtpd/opensmtpd.conf` line (or copy a pre‑written file). After that the `CMD ["opensmtpd","-d"]` will launch successfully and the compose stack will come up. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine image you’re using doesn’t have the community repository enabled, so the `apk add opensmtpd` step can’t find the package, and the Flask image is pulling in the heavyweight `docker` Python client which requires compilation tools that aren’t present in the slim base. Fix it by editing the two Dockerfiles: in the SMTP Dockerfile, enable the community repository before installing OpenSMTPD (for example, echo the repo line into `/etc/apk/repositories` or add `apk add --no-cache opensmtpd@community`), and in the Flask Dockerfile either switch to an Alpine‑based Python image or add the build dependencies (`gcc`, `musl-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `python3-dev`) before running `pip install`. Removing the unnecessary `docker` Python package also eliminates the need for those extra tools. After these changes the images will build successfully and the compose file can start the vulnerable service as intended.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the OpenSMTPD image never creates a valid configuration file before the daemon is started – the `opensmtpd.conf` file is written to a directory that does not yet exist and the daemon is launched with the default configuration, which aborts the container startup. Fix it by ensuring the configuration directory is created, the config file is written correctly, and then start the daemon with that file. In practice you can change the `smtp/Dockerfile` to first make the `/etc/opensmtpd` directory, write a minimal “listen on *” line into `/etc/opensmtpd/opensmtpd.conf`, set appropriate permissions, and finally launch OpenSMTPD pointing at that config. After that the `docker‑compose.yml` does not need any changes; the image will build and the service will come up without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based opensmtpd Dockerfile tries to write the configuration file before the opensmtpd package (and its required directories) are fully installed, which leaves the target path unreadable when the daemon starts. Fix it by installing the package first, then creating the /etc/opensmtpd directory and writing the minimal config, and finally setting the correct permissions on the file. In practice you would reorder the RUN statement so that apk add executes on its own line, then add a separate RUN to create the config directory, echo the “listen on *” line into /etc/opensmtpd/opensmtpd.conf, and chmod it to 644. This ensures the file exists with proper rights before the container’s CMD tries to launch opensmtpd, eliminating the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the smtp Dockerfile tries to write the configuration file in a single RUN step that mixes shell redirection with a pipe‑style command, and Alpine’s default sh doesn’t handle the quoted “>” as expected when the whole line is wrapped in a back‑slashed continuation; splitting the steps fixes the syntax error. Change the Dockerfile so the directory is created, then add the config file in a separate RUN command (for example: RUN mkdir -p /etc/opensmtpd && chmod 755 /etc/opensmtpd && echo "listen on *" > /etc/opensmtpd/opensmtpd.conf && chmod 644 /etc/opensmtpd/opensmtpd.conf). After that the image will build successfully and the compose file can start the smtp service without crashing.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based OpenSMTPD image is created without the directories that the daemon expects (the queue under /var/spool/opensmtpd and the runtime socket directory under /var/run/opensmtpd). When the container starts the binary can’t write its queue or socket and exits, which Docker reports as a build/run error. Fix it by extending the smtp/Dockerfile so it creates those directories and gives the proper permissions before the daemon is launched, for example adding a line such as `RUN mkdir -p /var/spool/opensmtpd /var/run/opensmtpd && chmod 755 /var/spool/opensmtpd /var/run/opensmtpd`. After that the image builds and the service can start normally.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
