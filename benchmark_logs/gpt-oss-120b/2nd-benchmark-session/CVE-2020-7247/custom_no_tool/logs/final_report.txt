CVE description: CVE‑2020‑7247 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The flaw resides in the smtp_mailaddr() function that parses the MAIL FROM address of an SMTP transaction. When the function encounters a malformed address it returns an incorrect value, causing the server to pass the un‑sanitized address string to a system call. An attacker can inject shell metacharacters (for example, by using a semicolon‑delimited payload such as `MAIL FROM:<;id;>`) and cause the vulnerable OpenSMTPD daemon to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the daemon process, which on most installations runs as root. The vulnerability affects all OpenSMTPD releases that are earlier than version 6.6.2, i.e., any version that was built after the commit a8e222352f and before the 6.6.2 release. It can be triggered remotely without authentication by simply connecting to the SMTP service on the standard port (25) or any other port on which the daemon is listening and sending the crafted SMTP commands. Successful exploitation results in full compromise of the host, allowing the attacker to run any command, create a reverse shell, modify files, or perform further lateral movement.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][opensmtpd][['6.5', '6.5.0', '6.5.1', '6.5.2', '6.6', '6.6.0', '6.6.1']] OpenSMTPD daemon providing the SMTP service; vulnerable versions allow command injection via the MAIL FROM field, which is the core component required for the CVE-2020-7247 exploitation.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container probably crashes because the Flask app tries to open a MySQL connection at import time, before the database service is ready, so the process exits with an exception. Move the MySQL connection logic inside a function that is called lazily (for example, create a helper that returns a live connection, retrying until it succeeds) or add a start‑up script that waits for the `db` host to accept connections (using `nc`, `wait‑for-it.sh`, or a simple loop with `mysqladmin ping`). Updating `app.py` to establish the connection on the first request (or inside each endpoint) and handling connection errors gracefully will let the container start, and the Flask service will become operational once MySQL is up. Additionally, ensure the `depends_on` clause is kept so Docker starts the DB first, but the runtime wait is still needed because `depends_on` only orders container start, not readiness.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Flask container is likely failing because it tries to open a MySQL connection before the database service is ready, so adding a small start‑up wait script (or a Docker healthcheck on the db service and using depends_on with condition: service_healthy) will give the MySQL server time to initialize. You can create a wait-for-db.sh that loops on mysqladmin ping against the host db and only then exec python app.py, then change the CMD in the Dockerfile to run that script. Additionally, the init‑sql volume mount can be left as‑is, but if you ever reuse the same volume you may want to remove the explicit CREATE DATABASE statement from init.sql to avoid “database already exists” errors. Making these two changes—adding a proper service health check / wait‑for‑db wrapper and simplifying the init script—will let the container start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The web container is failing because it never reaches the Flask start‑up – the `wait‑for‑db.sh` script is invoked as the container’s command but it exits after the MySQL health‑check loop finishes, never actually launching the app. Fix it by changing the Dockerfile CMD to run the script *and* the Flask process in one line (or by making the script `exec` the Python process). For example, replace the last two lines in the Dockerfile with  

```dockerfile
COPY wait-for-db.sh /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wait-for-db.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-db.sh"]
```  

and modify `wait-for-db.sh` so the final line reads `exec python /app/app.py` (which you already have). With the script now set as the container’s entrypoint, Docker will keep the process alive, the MySQL health‑check will succeed, and the Flask service will start correctly. No other files need to be changed.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The composition defines only three services: a custom Flask web app, MySQL 5.7, and Redis 5. None of these correspond to the required opensmtpd service, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Because opensmtpd is not present, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable list, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail as well.
	- ERROR: The composition defines only three services: a custom Flask web app, MySQL 5.7, and Redis 5. None of these correspond to the required opensmtpd service, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Because opensmtpd is not present, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable list, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail as well.
	- FIX: To satisfy the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones you need to add an OpenSMTPD service definition to the compose file and pin it to a safe version (≥ 6.6.2). Insert a new service block (e.g., smtp:) that uses an image such as opensmtpd/opensmtpd:6.6.2 or builds from the official source, expose port 25, and optionally add a simple healthcheck that runs smtpctl status. Once the OpenSMTPD container is present with a non‑vulnerable version, the composition will contain the required hard‑dependency and the version‑validation step will succeed.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing in the `web` service because the single `RUN` statement tries to install the MySQL client and then immediately invoke `pip` without a proper line‑continuation, so the shell treats the `pip` command as a separate argument to `apt-get` and the install aborts. The quick fix is to split the steps (or add a missing back‑slash) so the image first installs the required Debian packages, cleans the apt cache, and only then runs `pip install`. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to something like:

```
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y default-mysql-client && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install Flask==1.0.2 Jinja2==2.11.3 markupsafe==2.0.1 \
    redis==3.5.3 mysql-connector-python==8.0.21 itsdangerous==1.1.0
```

or keep a single `RUN` but ensure the back‑slash is present before the `pip` invocation. This separates the package manager step from the Python‑package step, lets the MySQL client be installed correctly, and allows the image to build without errors. After updating the Dockerfile, rebuild the compose stack and the containers should start normally.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile pins a set of Python packages that are no longer compatible with the python:3.8‑slim runtime (for example, Jinja2 1.0.2 expects a newer MarkupSafe than the one you request). Removing the strict version constraints (or updating them to versions that work together) lets pip install the dependencies without errors. Also make sure the wait‑for‑db.sh script is executable before it’s used as the container’s command—add a `chmod +x wait-for-db.sh` right after copying it (or use `COPY --chmod=755 wait-for-db.sh /usr/local/bin/`), and change the final CMD to actually launch Flask after the health check, e.g. `CMD ["sh","/usr/local/bin/wait-for-db.sh"]`. With those two adjustments the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the slim Python base image does not contain the “default‑mysql‑client” package name, so the apt‑get command aborts and the image never finishes. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct client package (e.g. mysql-client or default‑mysql‑client‑core) and clean up the apt cache after installation; this will let the image build successfully and the rest of the compose file can run unchanged.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the slim‑base image doesn’t provide the `mysql-client` package name used in the Dockerfile and several of the Python libraries need compilation tools, so the `apt‑get install` step exits with an error. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct client package (e.g. `default-mysql-client` on Debian‑slim) and add the build essentials (`build-essential` and `python3-dev`) before running `pip install`, then keep the cleanup of the apt cache; after that the rest of the Dockerfile (copying the scripts and setting the entrypoint) will succeed.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is coming from the `Dockerfile` in `custom_no_tool/app`. The Debian‑based `python:3.8‑slim` image does not provide the meta‑package `default-mysql-client` out of the box, so the `apt‑get install` step aborts and the image never finishes. The easiest fix is to replace that package with the concrete client that actually exists in the slim repositories (for example `default-mysql-client-core` or simply `mysql-client`), and keep the rest of the dependencies as they are. Edit the Dockerfile so the install line reads something like:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        mysql-client \
        build-essential \
        python3-dev && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

This change satisfies the `wait-for-db.sh` script (which only needs the `mysqladmin` binary) and lets the rest of the Docker build complete without errors. After rebuilding, the compose stack should start normally.
