    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u20117247 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenSMTPD mail transfer agent. The flaw resides in the smtp_mailaddr() function that parses the MAIL FROM address of an SMTP transaction. When the function encounters a malformed address it returns an incorrect value, causing the server to pass the un\u2011sanitized address string to a system call. An attacker can inject shell metacharacters (for example, by using a semicolon\u2011delimited payload such as `MAIL FROM:<;id;>`) and cause the vulnerable OpenSMTPD daemon to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the daemon process, which on most installations runs as root. The vulnerability affects all OpenSMTPD releases that are earlier than version 6.6.2, i.e., any version that was built after the commit a8e222352f and before the 6.6.2 release. It can be triggered remotely without authentication by simply connecting to the SMTP service on the standard port (25) or any other port on which the daemon is listening and sending the crafted SMTP commands. Successful exploitation results in full compromise of the host, allowing the attacker to run any command, create a reverse shell, modify files, or perform further lateral movement.",
