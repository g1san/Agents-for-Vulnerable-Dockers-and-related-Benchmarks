    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u20113129 is a remote code execution vulnerability that exists in the Laravel Ignition error\u2011handling package (the default debug page used by Laravel applications). When a Laravel application runs with debug mode enabled, Ignition exposes a POST\u2011only JSON API (e.g., `/_ignition/execute-solution`). The endpoint deserializes user\u2011controlled data from a PHAR archive or from files written via PHP stream wrappers. An attacker can supply a crafted PHAR payload that is deserialized without proper validation, triggering PHP object injection and allowing arbitrary commands to be executed with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. The flaw affects Ignition versions up to and including 2.5.1 (and any Laravel framework version prior to 8.4.2 that ships with those Ignition versions). Successful exploitation gives an unauthenticated attacker full command execution on the host, compromising the application, its database, and any connected services.",
