    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u20113129 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Laravel Ignition error\u2011handling package. Versions of Ignition prior to 2.5.2 (commonly bundled with Laravel framework versions up to 8.4.1) allow an attacker to supply a crafted PHAR archive through the Ignition debug endpoint. The package reads attacker\u2011controlled data with file_get_contents and writes it with file_put_contents, which can be abused to deserialize malicious PHP objects. When the crafted PHAR is deserialized, a gadget chain (e.g., Monolog RCE gadgets) is executed, giving the attacker the ability to run arbitrary system commands on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication when the Laravel application runs with debug mode enabled and the Ignition debug page is accessible.",
