CVE description: CVE‑2022‑22947 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host running the gateway. The flaw resides in the Actuator route‑management API, which evaluates Spring Expression Language (SpEL) strings without proper sanitisation. When the Actuator endpoints (such as /actuator/gateway/routes and /actuator/gateway/refresh) are exposed to the network and not protected, an attacker can send a crafted JSON payload that includes a malicious SpEL expression (e.g., #{T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('id')}). The gateway evaluates this expression when the route is refreshed, causing the injected code to run with the privileges of the application process. Affected versions are all Spring Cloud Gateway releases prior to 3.1.1 and prior to 3.0.7. Successful exploitation results in full remote code execution, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary commands, install back‑doors, extract data, or pivot within the internal network. Mitigation requires upgrading to Spring Cloud Gateway 3.1.1, 3.0.7, or later, or disabling/locking down the vulnerable Actuator endpoints.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile expects a Maven wrapper script (./mvnw) that isn’t present in the source tree, so the container can’t compile the application; to fix it, either add the Maven wrapper files to the project or replace the wrapper call with a plain Maven invocation (e.g., RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y maven && mvn -B package -DskipTests) and make sure the required packages (such as curl for the healthcheck) are installed in the builder stage, then the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running but its health check is failing (status: starting, failing streak 1). The healthcheck attempts to run "curl", which is not present in the container, causing the health check to error out: "exec: \"curl\": executable file not found in $PATH".
	- ERROR: The container is running but its health check is failing (status: starting, failing streak 1). The healthcheck attempts to run "curl", which is not present in the container, causing the health check to error out: "exec: \"curl\": executable file not found in $PATH".
	- FIX: Add the curl binary to the runtime image—edit the final stage of gateway/Dockerfile to run `apk add --no‑cache curl` (or ensure that line is present), then rebuild the image with `docker‑compose build` and restart the stack. Because the health‑check command is executed inside the container, the image must contain the curl executable; once the image is rebuilt with curl installed the health‑check will be able to contact `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health` and report a healthy status.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running but its health check is failing. The health status is 'starting' with a failing streak, and the health check log shows an error: "curl": executable file not found in $PATH. This indicates the required curl binary is missing, so the container is not considered healthy.
	- ERROR: The container is running but its health check is failing. The health status is 'starting' with a failing streak, and the health check log shows an error: "curl": executable file not found in $PATH. This indicates the required curl binary is missing, so the container is not considered healthy.
	- FIX: Add curl to the runtime image (the second stage) so the health‑check command can be executed. The final stage already uses `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine`; after the `RUN apk add --no-cache curl` line make sure the image is rebuilt and the health‑check points to the installed binary (e.g., `/usr/bin/curl`). If the curl package is still missing, replace the health‑check with a tool that is already present such as `wget`, or use a full JDK base that includes curl. Rebuilding the Dockerfile after installing curl (or switching the health‑check command) will let the container report a healthy state.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state, but its health check is failing. The healthcheck attempts to run "curl -f http://localhost:5678", but the log shows "exec: \"curl\": executable file not found in $PATH", causing the health status to remain "starting" and the health log to record a failure. This indicates the container is not operating correctly according to its health configuration.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state, but its health check is failing. The healthcheck attempts to run "curl -f http://localhost:5678", but the log shows "exec: \"curl\": executable file not found in $PATH", causing the health status to remain "starting" and the health log to record a failure. This indicates the container is not operating correctly according to its health configuration.
	- FIX: Add the curl binary to the hashicorp/http‑echo container (or replace the check with a command that exists there). For example, create a small Dockerfile that starts FROM hashicorp/http‑echo:0.2.3, runs apk add --no‑cache curl, copies the original entrypoint, and use that image for the backend service, or change the healthcheck to use wget (which is already present in the image). After the executable is available, the “curl -f http://localhost:5678” healthcheck will succeed and the service will report healthy.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the gateway Dockerfile tries to compile the source with Maven on an Alpine‑based JDK image, but Alpine’s default package repository doesn’t provide the `maven` binary under that name, so the `apk add maven` step aborts and the subsequent `mvn -B package` command can’t run. I would replace the builder stage with an official Maven image that already contains a working Maven installation (for example `FROM maven:3.9.6-openjdk-17-slim`), copy the project files into it, run the `mvn -B package -DskipTests` command, and then copy the resulting JAR into the lightweight JRE image exactly as before. This eliminates the package‑install failure and lets the build finish successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `http‑echo` binary you copy from the `hashicorp/http-echo:0.2.3` image is linked against glibc, while the final stage of the backend Dockerfile runs on Alpine which only provides musl; the binary cannot be executed and the container aborts. Replace the Alpine base with a glibc‑based distro (for example `debian:bookworm‑slim` or `ubuntu:22.04`) or pull a Alpine‑compatible version of `http‑echo` and copy that instead. After switching the base image (and optionally adding `EXPOSE 5678` so the port mapping is explicit) the build completes and the service starts correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the backend stage copies the http‑echo binary but never makes it executable, so the container exits immediately and the health‑check can’t reach port 5678; simply add a `chmod +x /http-echo` after the `COPY --from=echo /http-echo /http-echo` line in `backend/Dockerfile`. While you’re there, verify that the `curl` binary used by the health‑checks is in the expected location (in Alpine it lives at `/usr/bin/curl`), but the primary fix is to ensure the http‑echo binary is marked executable before the container starts.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the gateway Dockerfile expects the JAR to be named `gateway-0.0.1‑SNAPSHOT.jar` in `/app/target`, but Maven is producing a different artifact name (for example `gateway‑0.0.1‑SNAPSHOT‑exec.jar` when the Spring Boot plugin re‑packages the archive). Change the copy line in the final stage to reference the actual file that the Spring Boot Maven plugin creates, e.g. `COPY --from=builder /app/target/*-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar`. While you are updating the Dockerfile, also make the backend health‑check match the exposed port by changing the health‑check URL to `http://localhost:5678` (the container’s internal port) and keep the host‑side mapping `9090:5678` unchanged. After these two small edits the images build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the final stage of the gateway image tries to copy a JAR with a wildcard (`COPY --from=builder /app/target/*-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar`). In a Spring Boot build the `target` directory usually contains two JARs – the original artifact (e.g. `gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) and the repackaged “fat‑jar” (e.g. `gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original`). The wildcard therefore matches both files and the `COPY` command aborts with “more than one file specified”. To fix the problem, change the copy line so it selects only the repackaged jar that the Spring Boot plugin creates, for example:

```dockerfile
# copy only the executable fat‑jar produced by the Spring Boot plugin
COPY --from=builder /app/target/gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
```

or, if you prefer to keep a pattern, make it more specific:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/app.jar
```

and then rename it in the same command:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/app.jar
```

(ensuring the pattern does not also match the `.original` file). After updating the `COPY` instruction the gateway image builds correctly, and the compose file can start both services without error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
