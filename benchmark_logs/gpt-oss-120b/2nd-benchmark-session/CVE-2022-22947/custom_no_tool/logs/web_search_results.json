{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201122947 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway. The flaw resides in the gateway actuator endpoint (\\/actuator\\/gateway\\/routes) which, when enabled, exposed to the network and not secured, accepts JSON payloads that are later processed by the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) engine. An attacker can supply a malicious SpEL expression (for example in the \\\"uri\\\" or filter value fields) that is evaluated without proper validation, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host running the gateway process. The vulnerability affects Spring Cloud Gateway versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 and 3.1.0 through 3.1.3 (including earlier unsupported releases). Successful exploitation allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to run any command with the privileges of the gateway process, typically leading to full system compromise.",
