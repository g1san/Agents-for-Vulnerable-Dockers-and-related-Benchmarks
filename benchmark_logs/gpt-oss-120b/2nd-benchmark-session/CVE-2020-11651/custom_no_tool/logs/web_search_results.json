    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111651 is a critical vulnerability in SaltStack Salt (the Salt master component). The flaw resides in the ClearFuncs class of the Salt master process, which does not properly validate method calls received over the ZeroMQ RPC interface (default ports 4505/4506). Because of this missing validation, an unauthenticated attacker who can reach the master\u2019s ZeroMQ port can invoke privileged internal functions directly. Exploitation allows the attacker to retrieve the master\u2019s AES root key, read arbitrary files on the master (including credential files such as /etc/shadow), upload arbitrary files to any location on the master, and execute arbitrary shell commands on the master or on any connected minion. The attacker can also schedule jobs on all minions, effectively obtaining full control of the entire Salt infrastructure. The vulnerability affects Salt master versions prior to the patches released in the 2019.2.4 series for the classic releases and prior to version 3000.2 for the Salt 3000 series. The attack vector is remote code execution without any authentication, making the flaw extremely severe. Mitigation requires upgrading the Salt master to a version that includes the fix (\u2265\u202f2019.2.4 or \u2265\u202f3000.2) and restricting network access to the ZeroMQ ports.",
