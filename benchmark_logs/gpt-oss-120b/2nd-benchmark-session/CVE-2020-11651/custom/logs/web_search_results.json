    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111651 is a remote code execution vulnerability in SaltStack Salt. The flaw resides in the `ClearFuncs` class of the Salt master process. Versions of the Salt master earlier than 2019.2.4 and earlier than 3000.2 do not correctly validate the name of the method being invoked over the ZeroMQ RPC interface (default port 4506). An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted ZeroMQ request that invokes privileged Salt functions, allowing the attacker to retrieve the master\u2019s RSA private key, read or write arbitrary files on the master, execute commands on the master, and issue commands to all connected minions. This gives the attacker full control over the entire Salt infrastructure.",
