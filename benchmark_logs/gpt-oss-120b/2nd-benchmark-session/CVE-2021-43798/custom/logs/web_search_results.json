    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201143798 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Grafana versions 8.0.0\u2011beta1 through 8.3.0. The public API endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId/<path>` does not properly sanitize the user\u2011supplied path. An attacker can include `../` sequences (using curl with `--path-as-is`) to traverse out of the plugin directory and read arbitrary files on the host file system. No authentication is required. Exploitation allows reading of any file readable by the Grafana process, such as `/etc/passwd`, Grafana configuration files, and the SQLite database (`/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db`). Disclosure of the database can lead to credential harvesting and further compromise. The vulnerability is fixed in Grafana 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, and 8.3.1.",
