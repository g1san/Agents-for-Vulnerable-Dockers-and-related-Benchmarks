    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201143798 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Grafana 8.x. The public plugin handler at `/public/plugins/<pluginId>/\u2026` does not correctly sanitize the file path supplied by the client. An attacker can include `../` sequences (or their URL\u2011encoded equivalents) in the request URL, causing Grafana to resolve the path outside of the plugin directory and read arbitrary files from the host filesystem. The flaw is unauthenticated; any remote user who can reach the Grafana HTTP endpoint (default port 3000) can retrieve files such as `/etc/passwd`, the SQLite database `/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db`, or the configuration file `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`. Disclosure of these files can reveal credential hashes, secret keys, and other sensitive data, enabling further attacks such as credential cracking or session hijacking. The vulnerability affects all Grafana releases from 8.0.0\u2011beta1 through 8.3.0, excluding the patched releases 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, and 8.3.1. Patching or front\u2011ending Grafana with a path\u2011normalising reverse proxy mitigates the issue.",
