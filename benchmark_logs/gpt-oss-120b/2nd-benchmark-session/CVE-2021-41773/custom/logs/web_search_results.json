    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201141773 is a directory\u2011traversal and file\u2011disclosure flaw in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. A change in the URL\u2011path normalization code allowed specially crafted requests that contain encoded \"../\" sequences to escape the configured DocumentRoot. When the target path is not protected by a \"Require all denied\" directive, the server will serve the requested file from anywhere on the filesystem. This enables an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files such as /etc/passwd, configuration files, source code of CGI scripts, and, if executable scripts are reachable, to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request such as GET /%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1. No authentication or special privileges are required; the only prerequisite is that the vulnerable Apache instance is reachable over the network with its default or a permissive configuration.",
