    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201141773 is a path\u2011normalisation flaw in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. The bug allows an attacker to craft URL\u2011encoded \"../\" traversal sequences that bypass the normal removal of parent\u2011directory references. When the server is configured with the default `<Directory />` directive that uses `Require all granted`, the crafted request can map to files outside the configured DocumentRoot and cause the server to disclose arbitrary files. If the targeted location runs the `mod_cgi` module, the same bypass can be used to execute commands via CGI scripts, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability is confined to the core HTTP service of Apache; no additional services are required for the exploit.",
