CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11652 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt *master* daemon. The flaw exists in the handling of file system paths within the master’s execution modules (ClearFuncs and related wheel functions). An authenticated Salt user can supply specially crafted paths that bypass normal validation, allowing directory traversal and arbitrary file read/write on the master host. By exploiting this weakness, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands, read sensitive files such as /etc/shadow, upload malicious scripts, and gain full control over the Salt master and any connected minions. The vulnerability affects a wide range of Salt versions, including classic releases from 2015.8.x up to 2019.2.3 and Salt 3000 releases up to 3000.1. The issue was fixed in Salt 2019.2.4, 3000.2 and later. Exploits typically involve connecting to the master’s ZeroMQ interface (ports 4505/4506) and issuing malformed requests to retrieve the master’s root key or directly invoke the unsafe path handling, leading to remote code execution on the master server.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the attacker container tries to talk to the Docker daemon before it’s fully up, so the docker command in exploit.py fails. Add a health‑check to the vulnerable‑docker service that waits for the daemon to be listening on 2375 (e.g. try curl http://localhost:2375/_ping) and set depends_on with condition: service_healthy for the attacker service. Then increase the initial sleep in exploit.py or, better yet, replace it with a loop that retries the docker command until it succeeds. This ensures the daemon is ready before the exploit runs, allowing the container to start correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image does not have a package called docker‑cli; the Docker client is provided by the docker package, so the RUN line should install docker instead of docker‑cli. Change the Dockerfile to `RUN apk add --no-cache docker curl python3 py3-pip && pip install --no-cache-dir requests`, then copy the script and keep the same entrypoint. This resolves the package‑not‑found error and lets the attacker container start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image does not include the Docker client binary under the name “docker” after installing the package “docker”; the package actually provides “docker-cli”. Change the apk line to install the proper client (for example “apk add --no‑cache docker-cli”) or install the Docker package from the community repository that supplies the “docker” command. Also make sure the copy of exploit.py matches the build context (the file must be located in the same directory as the Dockerfile or in a sub‑folder that is sent to the daemon). After correcting the package name and confirming the source file is present, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine base image does not provide a package called docker – it only ships the Docker client as docker-cli, and the client binary needs a few runtime libraries that aren’t pulled in automatically when you request the non‑existent “docker” package. To fix it, edit the attacker/Dockerfile so that the apk line installs docker-cli instead of docker (and keeps curl, python3 and py3‑pip), for example: RUN apk add --no‑cache docker-cli curl python3 py3-pip && pip install --no‑cache-dir requests. After that change, the image will build successfully and the exploit script will be able to invoke the Docker CLI against the vulnerable daemon.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine 3.14 base you start from doesn’t provide the docker‑cli package in its default repositories, so the `apk add docker-cli` step aborts. Switch the attacker image to a base that already contains the Docker client (or add the community repository before installing it). For example, replace the first line of the Dockerfile with `FROM docker:20.10-cli-alpine` (or any newer `docker:*‑cli‑alpine` tag) and then keep the `apk add python3 py3-pip && pip install --no‑cache‑dir requests` line; this gives you a functional Docker CLI out‑of‑the‑box and eliminates the build error. If you prefer to stay on Alpine 3.14, you can enable the community repo (`echo "http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community" >> /etc/apk/repositories`) before the `apk add docker-cli` command. Either approach resolves the image‑building failure.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the attacker image is based on the lightweight docker:20.10‑cli‑alpine image, which only contains the Docker binary but does not provide a full Python development environment; the `apk add` line installs `python3` and `py3-pip`, but on Alpine the `pip` executable is named `pip3`, so the `pip install` command cannot be found and the image aborts during the build.  

Fix it by installing the correct Python‑related packages and invoking the right pip binary. Change the Dockerfile to first install `python3` and `py3-pip` (which also provides `pip3`), then use `pip3` to install the `requests` module, and finally copy the exploit script. A minimal corrected Dockerfile looks like this:  

```dockerfile
FROM docker:20.10-cli-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip curl && \
    pip3 install --no-cache-dir requests
COPY exploit.py /exploit.py
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "/exploit.py"]
```  

With the correct `pip3` command the image builds successfully, and the rest of the compose file can run unchanged.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the attacker image is based on a tag that does not exist on Docker Hub and the Alpine package list is not refreshed before the install step, so the apk command cannot find python3, pip or curl. Change the FROM line to use a valid Alpine‑based CLI image (for example docker:20.10-cli-alpine) and prepend an apk update to the install command, then copy the exploit script from the same directory as the Dockerfile. After those changes the Dockerfile will look like FROM docker:20.10-cli-alpine RUN apk update && apk add --no‑cache python3 py3-pip curl && pip3 install --no‑cache-dir requests COPY exploit.py /exploit.py ENTRYPOINT ["python3","/exploit.py"], and the compose file can build the image without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the attacker image is based on a CLI‑only Docker image that does not contain the Docker client binary, so the `docker ps` command in the exploit cannot be found; adding the client (or using a full Docker image) fixes the problem. In the attacker Dockerfile, replace the base image with one that includes the Docker CLI (for example `docker:20.10` instead of `docker:20.10-cli-alpine`) or explicitly install it with `apk add --no-cache docker`; then rebuild the stack. Also make sure the `exploit.py` file is correctly placed in the build context and referenced as `COPY exploit.py /exploit.py` (the path is already correct), and ensure the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable points to the running vulnerable‑docker service as you have done. After these changes the image builds successfully and the script can communicate with the vulnerable daemon.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the Dockerfile assumes an apt‑based distro, but the default `docker:20.10` image is Alpine‑based and does not contain `apt-get`. Switch the package manager (or the base image) so the required tools can be installed. For example, change the first line to `FROM docker:20.10-dind` (or any Debian‑based Docker tag) and keep the `apt‑get` commands, or keep the original Alpine image and replace the install line with `RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip curl && pip3 install --no-cache-dir requests`. After that the `COPY` and `ENTRYPOINT` lines remain unchanged, and the container will build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
