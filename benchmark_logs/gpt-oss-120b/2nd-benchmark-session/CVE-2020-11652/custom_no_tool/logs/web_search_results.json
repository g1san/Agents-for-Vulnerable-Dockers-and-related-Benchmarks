    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111652 is a critical vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt *master* daemon. The flaw exists in the handling of file system paths within the master\u2019s execution modules (ClearFuncs and related wheel functions). An authenticated Salt user can supply specially crafted paths that bypass normal validation, allowing directory traversal and arbitrary file read/write on the master host. By exploiting this weakness, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands, read sensitive files such as /etc/shadow, upload malicious scripts, and gain full control over the Salt master and any connected minions. The vulnerability affects a wide range of Salt versions, including classic releases from 2015.8.x up to 2019.2.3 and Salt\u202f3000 releases up to 3000.1. The issue was fixed in Salt 2019.2.4, 3000.2 and later. Exploits typically involve connecting to the master\u2019s ZeroMQ interface (ports 4505/4506) and issuing malformed requests to retrieve the master\u2019s root key or directly invoke the unsafe path handling, leading to remote code execution on the master server.",
