    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20115734 is a remote code execution vulnerability in phpMyAdmin. The flaw exists in the \"table search and replace\" feature, which passes user\u2011controlled input to PHP's preg_replace() function without proper sanitisation. On PHP versions\u202f\u2264\u202f5.4.6 the null\u2011byte handling allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code that is evaluated, resulting in code execution with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. Affected phpMyAdmin releases are all versions prior to the fixes: 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control over the server hosting phpMyAdmin, including the ability to read, modify, or delete databases and pivot to other services.",
