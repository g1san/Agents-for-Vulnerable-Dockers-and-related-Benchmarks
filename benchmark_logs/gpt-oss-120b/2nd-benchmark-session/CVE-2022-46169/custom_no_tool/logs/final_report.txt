CVE description: CVE‑2022‑46169 is an unauthenticated remote command injection vulnerability in the Cacti web‑based network monitoring application (versions up to and including 1.2.22). The flaw resides in the public endpoint remote_agent.php. The script obtains the client IP address from HTTP headers that can be forged, allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication check that relies on the poller table. Once authorized, the attacker can invoke the \"polldata\" action, which builds a command line for proc_open() using the attacker‑controlled poller_id parameter without any sanitisation. By supplying a crafted poller_id such as ";id" the attacker can execute arbitrary operating‑system commands on the server as the www‑data user. The attack requires only the URL of the vulnerable Cacti installation; no valid credentials or session cookies are needed. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full remote code execution on the host running Cacti.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote command execution

- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['8.0']] Cacti stores its configuration and poller data in a MySQL database; a compatible MySQL server is required for the application to run.
- [SOFT-WEB][php][['8.1-apache']] Cacti runs on PHP with an Apache web server; this image provides the required PHP runtime and HTTP server to serve the Cacti web interface.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Python stack in the Dockerfile is pinned to very old releases (Flask 1.0 and Jinja2 2.10) that are no longer compatible with the Python 3.8‑slim base; upgrading Flask (for example to 2.2 or later) and letting it pull a matching Jinja2 version resolves the import errors. In the application code the template string is also malformed – the f‑string syntax `"{{ {{ name }} }}"` expands to an invalid Jinja expression, so replace the line with a plain literal string such as `template = "<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>"` and pass `name` to `render_template_string`. After updating the Dockerfile to install the newer Flask version and correcting the template string, the image builds and the container starts correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the slim Python base image lacks the system libraries needed to compile mysql‑connector‑python’s dependencies, so the pip install step aborts. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to install the required build tools and any shared libraries before running pip—add a line such as “RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y gcc libffi-dev libssl-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*” right after the FROM statement, then keep the existing pip install line. After the packages are present the build will succeed and the Flask app can start normally.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Python‑based image is trying to install system packages that either aren’t available in the slim Debian base or are missing the prerequisites for a clean compile, and the container never gets a proper Flask entry point defined. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so it first installs the full build‑essential toolchain (e.g. `apt-get install -y --no‑install‑recommends build-essential default-libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev`) before installing the Python wheels, then set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable inside the image (or replace the `flask run` command with an explicit `python app.py`). That way the apt step succeeds, the Python dependencies install cleanly, and the container can start the Flask app without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the slim‑based Python image does not contain the “default‑libmysqlclient‑dev” package (and pulling in the full build‑essential toolchain is unnecessary for the pure‑Python MySQL connector you’re using). To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to drop the apt‑get install of build‑essential and default‑libmysqlclient‑dev and keep only the minimal packages you really need (for example just `apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`). Then let pip install `mysql-connector-python` as before; this removes the missing‑package error and allows the image to build successfully. If you later need a native MySQL client library, you can switch to `mysqlclient` and install the appropriate `libmariadb-dev-compat` package instead.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Python wheel for mysql‑connector‑python (or one of its transitive dependencies) needs a C compiler and a few development libraries that aren’t present in the python:3.8‑slim base. Add the minimal build tools before the pip install step (e.g., gcc and libssl-dev or build‑essential**) so the wheels can be compiled, and then remove them afterward to keep the image lightweight. Updating the Dockerfile to install those packages—then running pip install and cleaning the apt cache—will resolve the build error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build error is caused by missing development headers that the MySQL connector needs when it is compiled inside the slim‑based Python image. I would extend the Dockerfile to install the Python development package (python3-dev) together with the existing gcc and libssl-dev, and then clean the APT cache after the install; this provides the required headers so that `pip install mysql-connector-python` can succeed. After adding a line such as `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc libssl-dev python3-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` the image builds without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim‑based Python image does not contain the certificates and C libraries required for pip to fetch and compile the MySQL connector, so the apt step should also install ca‑certificates (and, to be safe, the client development headers). Edit the Dockerfile to add ca‑certificates and default-libmysqlclient-dev to the apt install line, then clean the package cache, and finally run the pip install; after that the image builds without errors. Also double‑check that app.py is really present in the app directory so the COPY command can find it.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Debian‑slim base image does not contain the “default‑libmysqlclient‑dev” package name used in the Dockerfile, so the apt‑get step aborts. Replace that line with a package that actually exists in the slim repos (for example “default-mysql-client”) or, if you only need the pure‑Python MySQL connector, drop the MySQL client development packages entirely. In practice you can change the Dockerfile to run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc libssl-dev python3-dev ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` (removing the dev‑client line), then keep the rest of the file unchanged; the image will build successfully and the Flask app will run as before.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to install the `python3-dev` package on the `python:3.8-slim` image, which already provides the interpreter and for which the development headers are named `python3.8-dev`; the generic `python3-dev` package cannot be resolved. Replace the line that installs `python3-dev` with either `python3.8-dev` (or simply omit it if you’re only using pure‑Python libraries) and keep the other required tools, then rebuild; the rest of the compose file and application code can stay unchanged.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
