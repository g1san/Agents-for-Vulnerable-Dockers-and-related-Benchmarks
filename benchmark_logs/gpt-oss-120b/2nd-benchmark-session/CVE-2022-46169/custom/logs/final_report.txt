CVE description: CVE‑2022‑46169 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the Cacti web‑application (versions up to and including 1.2.22). The flaw resides in the `remote_agent.php` endpoint. The script authenticates clients by extracting the client IP address from HTTP headers and checking it against entries in the `poller` database table. An attacker can spoof these headers (e.g., `X‑Forwarded‑For`) to bypass authentication. Once authorized, the attacker can invoke the `polldata` action, which processes a `poller_id` parameter. When the associated poller item has the action `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the supplied `poller_id` value is concatenated into a command string that is executed via `proc_open` without any sanitisation, leading to command injection. By sending a crafted request to `/remote_agent.php?action=polldata` with attacker‑controlled parameters, arbitrary commands are executed on the server with the privileges of the web‑server user (typically `www-data` or `apache`). This enables full remote code execution, allowing an attacker to compromise the host running Cacti.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][cacti][['1.2.22']] The vulnerable Cacti web application. Version 1.2.22 contains the unauthenticated authentication bypass and command injection in remote_agent.php, which is required to demonstrate CVE‑2022‑46169.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Relational database required by Cacti to store configuration and poller information. Version 5.7 is compatible with Cacti 1.2.22 and provides the `poller` table used by the vulnerable endpoint.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
