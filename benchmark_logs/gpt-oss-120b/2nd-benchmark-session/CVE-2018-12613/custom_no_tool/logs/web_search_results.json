    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201112613 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. The flaw resides in the handling of the **target** parameter in index.php. An attacker who can access a logged\u2011in phpMyAdmin instance can craft a double\u2011encoded request (e.g., using %253f which decodes to an unfiltered \u2018?\u2019) that bypasses the whitelist check and forces phpMyAdmin to include an arbitrary file from the server\u2019s filesystem. This results in a local file inclusion vulnerability. By causing phpMyAdmin to include a session file that contains attacker\u2011controlled PHP code, the vulnerability can be escalated to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the web\u2011server with the privileges of the phpMyAdmin process.",
