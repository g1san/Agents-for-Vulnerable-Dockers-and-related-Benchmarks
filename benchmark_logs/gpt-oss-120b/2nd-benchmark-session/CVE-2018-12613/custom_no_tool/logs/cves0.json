It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\r\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\r\nend user applications.\r\n\r\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\r\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\r\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\r\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\r\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\r\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\r\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\r\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\r\nlikely result in a crash.\r\n\r\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\r\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\r\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\r\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\r\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\r\n\r\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\r\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\r\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.8.\r\nOpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1t.\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zg (premium support customers\r\nonly).\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported on 29th November 2022 by Octavio Galland and\r\nMarcel Böhme (Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy).

      "description": "curl supports \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by using many headers.\n\nThe use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.",

      "description": "There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing\r\ninside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\r\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\r\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\r\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\r\nASN1_STRING.\r\n\r\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\r\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\r\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\r\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\r\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\r\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\r\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\r\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\r\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\r\nover a network.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL versions 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.8.\r\nOpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1t.\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zg (premium support customers\r\nonly).\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported on 11th January 2023 by David Benjamin (Google).\r\nThe fix was developed by Hugo Landau.",
