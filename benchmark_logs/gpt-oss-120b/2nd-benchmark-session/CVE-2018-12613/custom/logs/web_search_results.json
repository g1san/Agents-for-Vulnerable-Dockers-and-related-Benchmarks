    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201112613 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1. The flaw lies in the way phpMyAdmin validates the *target* parameter (and related file inclusion logic). The whitelist check does not correctly handle query strings or path\u2011traversal sequences, allowing an attacker to cause phpMyAdmin to include arbitrary files from the server\u2019s filesystem. When a malicious file containing PHP code is included, the code is executed with the privileges of the web\u2011server process, resulting in remote code execution. The vulnerability can also be used for local file inclusion to read sensitive files such as /etc/passwd. Exploitation requires only a reachable phpMyAdmin instance (authenticated or, in some configurations, unauthenticated) and does not depend on any additional services.",
