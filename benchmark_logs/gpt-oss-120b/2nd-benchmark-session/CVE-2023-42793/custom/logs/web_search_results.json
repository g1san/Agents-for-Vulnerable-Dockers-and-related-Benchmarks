    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity on\u2011premises installations. The flaw resides in the REST API request interceptor, which unintentionally disables authorization checks for any URL matching the pattern \"**/RPC2\". An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted REST calls (e.g., token creation or deletion endpoints) to obtain a valid authentication token for a privileged user, typically the default administrator. With the token, the attacker can create new admin\u2011level accounts, run arbitrary commands on the server host, and compromise build agents, leading to full remote code execution. The vulnerability affects all TeamCity server versions prior to 2023.05.4, and exploitation has been observed in the wild since October 2023. Updating to TeamCity 2023.05.4 or applying the official security\u2011patch plugin mitigates the issue.",
