CVE description: CVE-2023-42793 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity on‑premises server versions prior to 2023.05.4. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to create authentication tokens for arbitrary users (including the default administrator) via a hidden REST endpoint. Once a token is obtained, the attacker can invoke privileged APIs and execute arbitrary commands on the TeamCity host, resulting in full remote code execution. The vulnerability resides in a request‑interceptor that mistakenly disables authentication for wildcard paths such as "/**/RPC2". Exploitation requires only network access to the exposed TeamCity web UI; no user interaction or credentials are needed. Successful exploitation gives the attacker complete control over the CI/CD infrastructure, source code, stored secrets, and build agents.
Attack Type: remote code execution

- [HARD][jetbrains/teamcity-server][['2023.05.3', '2023.05.2', '2023.05.1', '2023.04.5', '2023.04.4', '2023.04.3', '2023.04.2', '2023.04.1', '2023.02.4', '2023.02.3', '2023.02.2', '2023.02.1', '2023.01.5', '2023.01.4', '2023.01.3', '2023.01.2', '2023.01.1', '2022.10.5', '2022.10.4', '2022.10.3', '2022.10.2', '2022.10.1', '2022.09.5', '2022.09.4', '2022.09.3', '2022.09.2', '2022.09.1']] The vulnerable TeamCity server provides the REST and XML‑RPC endpoints that contain the authentication bypass. Deploying this image with any of the listed versions reproduces the vulnerability.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['15']] TeamCity can use an external PostgreSQL database for storing configuration and build data. This service is required for a functional TeamCity installation but does not affect the presence of the vulnerability.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose fails because the MySQL service tries to mount the init script from a path that isn’t reachable inside the container; moving init.sql into a dedicated folder (for example ./mysql/init.sql) and updating the volume line to ‑ ./mysql/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql ensures the file is found at startup, and the rest of the configuration works unchanged. Additionally, confirming that the MySQL image version matches the environment variables (or switching to a newer MySQL 8 image that supports the same variables) eliminates any authentication‑plugin mismatches that can also abort container creation. After these adjustments the compose file builds and runs without errors.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: I would start by adding a Compose version line at the top (for example `version: "3.9"`), because newer Docker‑Compose implementations require it and the file will be rejected otherwise. Next I would double‑check the path that mounts the initialization script; the relative reference `./postgres/init.sql` must resolve to a real file from the directory where the docker‑compose.yml lives, so I would either move the init.sql into that location or change the bind‑mount to the correct absolute or relative path (e.g. `./dockers/CVE-2023-42793/custom_no_tool/postgres/init.sql`). Finally I would make sure the two named volumes (`teamcity_data` and `teamcity_logs`) are declared under the top‑level volumes section (which they already are) and that the host directories they map to exist or are created automatically; if the logs directory does not exist in the image, I would replace the log bind with a simple named volume or create the directory on startup. Making these three adjustments—adding the version header, fixing the init‑script bind‑mount path, and ensuring the volumes are correctly defined—will stop the build from failing.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose fails because the postgres container can’t find the ./postgres/init.sql file you bind‑mount – the path is resolved relative to the compose file’s directory, not to the dockers/CVE‑2023‑42793/custom_no_tool folder where the script actually lives. Move the init.sql into the same directory as the docker‑compose.yml or change the bind‑mount to the correct absolute (or properly relative) path, e.g. `- ${PWD}/postgres/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`. Once the script is reachable the db image will start without error and the rest of the stack can come up normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the docker‑compose file is mounting an init.sql that doesn’t exist at the relative path you’re using – the compose file lives in …/dockers/CVE-2023-42793/custom_no_tool so ./init.sql resolves to a non‑existent file, causing the PostgreSQL container to abort. Fix it by pointing the mount to the real script location (for example ./custom_no_tool/init.sql or simply use the copy that’s already in the postgres sub‑directory) and remove the duplicate postgres/init.sql mount if it isn’t needed; after correcting the path the compose file will start both containers without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because Docker‑Compose can’t find the init.sql file you’re mounting into the PostgreSQL container – the path `${PWD}/dockers/CVE-2023-42793/custom_no_tool/init.sql` is resolved relative to the directory where you run `docker‑compose`, not relative to the compose file itself, so the file isn’t found and the volume mount fails. Fix it by either moving the compose file to the repository root and using a path that matches the actual location of the SQL script (for example `./dockers/CVE-2023-42793/custom_no_tool/init.sql`), or by creating a bind‑mount that points to the correct absolute location on the host (e.g., `/full/path/to/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`). You can also remove the duplicate `postgres/init.sql` directory since it isn’t referenced, and be sure the `init.sql` file exists and is readable by the Docker daemon. After correcting the mount path the services will start and the image will build without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to mount an initialization script that the postgres container can’t find because the path is wrong – the compose file lives in custom_no_tool but the mount points to ./init.sql while the actual script is in the parent directory (or duplicated under a postgres sub‑folder). To fix the build failure simply point the volume mount at the real file and eliminate the duplicate copy. Change the db service’s volumes section to reference the correct relative location, for example:

```yaml
volumes:
  - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  - ./custom_no_tool/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
```

(or move the script into the same directory as the compose file and keep the original ./init.sql mount). After the mount points to a valid init.sql the container starts without errors, and the duplicate postgres/init.sql can be removed entirely since it isn’t used. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because the init.sql mount is pointing at a location that doesn’t exist relative to where Docker‑Compose is being invoked, so the PostgreSQL container can’t start its initialization script; to fix it, move init.sql into the same directory as docker‑compose.yml (or adjust the source path to an absolute or correctly‑relative location such as ${PWD}/init.sql), and then re‑run the stack. If the health‑check “service_healthy” condition is causing a schema error in your Docker version, replace the conditional syntax with a simple depends_on: db or upgrade to a Compose version that supports the condition flag. After correcting the file path (and optionally simplifying the dependency), the services will launch without the build error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the compose file tries to mount `${PWD}/init.sql` into the PostgreSQL container, but `${PWD}` is not expanded when Docker Compose parses the YAML, so the path resolves to an empty string and the host file cannot be found. Change the volume line to use an explicit absolute or relative path that Docker Compose can resolve, for example replace `- ${PWD}/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` with `- ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`. Ensure that the `init.sql` file lives in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` (or adjust the path accordingly) and then run `docker compose up --build` again. This resolves the missing‑file error and allows the images to be built and started correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the DB service cannot find the init.sql file at the specified relative path, so Docker aborts the mount during startup; move init.sql into the same directory as the docker‑compose.yml (or change the bind‑mount to use the correct path such as `./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro`) and ensure the file is readable. Then make the TeamCity container wait for the database health check to succeed by adding a condition to the depends_on entry (e.g. `depends_on: db: {condition: service_healthy}`) so the server doesn’t start before PostgreSQL is ready. After correcting the mount path and adding the health‑check condition the composition builds and runs without error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
