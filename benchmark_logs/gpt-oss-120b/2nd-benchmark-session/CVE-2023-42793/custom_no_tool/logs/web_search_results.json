    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity on\u2011premises server versions prior to 2023.05.4. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to create authentication tokens for arbitrary users (including the default administrator) via a hidden REST endpoint. Once a token is obtained, the attacker can invoke privileged APIs and execute arbitrary commands on the TeamCity host, resulting in full remote code execution. The vulnerability resides in a request\u2011interceptor that mistakenly disables authentication for wildcard paths such as \"/**/RPC2\". Exploitation requires only network access to the exposed TeamCity web UI; no user interaction or credentials are needed. Successful exploitation gives the attacker complete control over the CI/CD infrastructure, source code, stored secrets, and build agents.",
