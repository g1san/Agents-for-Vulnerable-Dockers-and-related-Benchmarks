{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server that allows an attacker to bypass normal path\u2011validation checks by using specially encoded characters in the request URI. The flaw enables access to files located in the protected WEB-INF directory (such as web.xml, configuration files, or source code) that should be inaccessible to unauthenticated users. The vulnerability exists because Jetty normalizes the request path before decoding encoded characters, allowing double\u2011decode or alias attacks that expose sensitive resources. The impact is the disclosure of confidential configuration and application files, which can aid further attacks. The issue affects multiple Jetty releases and is fixed in versions released after the vulnerable ranges.",
