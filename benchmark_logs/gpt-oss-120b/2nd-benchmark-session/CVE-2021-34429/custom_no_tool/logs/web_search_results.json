    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201134429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the protected WEB\u2011INF directory. Jetty incorrectly canonicalises URL\u2011encoded path segments, so a specially crafted request that contains an encoded dot (for example %u002e) is interpreted as a path traversal to \"/.\". After Jetty evaluates its security constraints, the later decoding step changes the path to point to files such as /WEB-INF/web.xml, /WEB-INF/classes/... or any other resource under WEB\u2011INF. The server then returns the requested file with a 200 OK response, leaking configuration files, deployment descriptors, source code and potentially credential information. The flaw affects multiple Jetty major releases that changed the URI parsing order to comply with RFC\u202f3986. Exploitation requires only network access to the HTTP endpoint; no authentication, user interaction, or special privileges are needed. The impact is a loss of confidentiality of sensitive application files, which can facilitate further attacks such as credential harvesting or detailed reconnaissance of the target application. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading Jetty to a version that decodes before normalising the URI and that adds explicit checks for encoded dot or null characters.",
