----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2021‑34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the protected WEB‑INF directory. Jetty incorrectly canonicalises URL‑encoded path segments, so a specially crafted request that contains an encoded dot (for example %u002e) is interpreted as a path traversal to "/.". After Jetty evaluates its security constraints, the later decoding step changes the path to point to files such as /WEB-INF/web.xml, /WEB-INF/classes/... or any other resource under WEB‑INF. The server then returns the requested file with a 200 OK response, leaking configuration files, deployment descriptors, source code and potentially credential information. The flaw affects multiple Jetty major releases that changed the URI parsing order to comply with RFC 3986. Exploitation requires only network access to the HTTP endpoint; no authentication, user interaction, or special privileges are needed. The impact is a loss of confidentiality of sensitive application files, which can facilitate further attacks such as credential harvesting or detailed reconnaissance of the target application. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading Jetty to a version that decodes before normalising the URI and that adds explicit checks for encoded dot or null characters.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The exploit container fails because the Alpine image does not provide a “docker‑cli” package – the binary you need to talk to the host socket is in the “docker” package – so the docker command never exists and the container exits immediately. Change the Dockerfile.exploit to install the proper package (for example `apk add --no-cache docker`) and rebuild the image; the rest of the compose file can stay the same. After rebuilding, `docker ps` will run inside the exploit container and you’ll see the host’s containers, confirming the socket exposure and reproducing CVE‑2021‑34429.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most likely reason the compose stack isn’t starting is that the vulnerable service never runs a real process – it just sleeps forever – so Docker marks it as exited once the container’s main process ends, and the exploit service can’t connect to the host socket. Fix it by changing the vulnerable command to keep the container alive with a long‑running foreground process such as tail -f /dev/null or by starting the actual Jetty server that the CVE targets, and be sure the exploit service has the Docker client installed (the Dockerfile already does that) and the script is executable (the chmod line is correct). Also, remove the privileged: true flag unless you truly need it, and make sure the compose file version (3.9) matches the Docker Engine you’re running. After updating the vulnerable service command to a persistent foreground process, Docker‑compose up should bring both containers up and allow the exploit script to list the host containers via the mounted socket.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The “exploit” service fails because the Alpine image only installs the Docker client but never starts a Docker daemon, so when the script runs it can’t communicate with the host daemon through the mounted socket; to fix it, add the --privileged flag (or at least give the container the docker group’s UID/GID) so the Docker client inside the container has permission to access /var/run/docker.sock, and make sure the socket mount is declared as read‑write (the default does this). You can also simplify the “vulnerable” service by using a lightweight keep‑alive command such as “sleep infinity” instead of tail‑f, which avoids any potential issues with the file not existing. Updating the compose file accordingly will let the exploit container list the host’s containers and demonstrate the CVE.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the vulnerable service fails to stay up is that `sleep infinity` is not supported by the BusyBox version shipped with Alpine 3.13, so the container exits as soon as the command returns an error. Replace the command with a long‑running loop (for example `sh -c "while true; do sleep 3600; done"`), or use `tail -f /dev/null` to keep the process alive. In the exploit service, the Docker client package on Alpine is called `docker-cli` instead of just `docker`, so change the `apk add` line to `apk add --no-cache docker-cli`. After rebuilding the exploit image and restarting the compose stack, both containers should start correctly and the script will be able to list the host’s Docker containers through the mounted socket.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker Compose configuration defines two services (vulnerable and exploit) based on Alpine Linux images and does not include the 'jetty' service. Consequently, no jetty version is installed, let alone one of the listed vulnerable versions. Therefore both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones are not met.
	- ERROR: The provided Docker Compose configuration defines two services (vulnerable and exploit) based on Alpine Linux images and does not include the 'jetty' service. Consequently, no jetty version is installed, let alone one of the listed vulnerable versions. Therefore both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones are not met.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to add a Jetty service that actually runs one of the vulnerable Jetty versions listed in the CVE description. Extend the compose file by defining a new service (for example jetty‑vuln) that uses an image such as jetty:9.4.37‑jdk11 (or builds a custom image that installs the specific vulnerable Jetty release) and exposes the HTTP port, then have the exploit container target that Jetty endpoint with the crafted request that triggers the path‑traversal bug. By including this Jetty service the composition now contains a hard‑coded vulnerable version, fulfilling both the code_hard_version and services_ok requirements.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine 3.13 image no longer provides a package called `docker` – the Docker client is now packaged as `docker-cli` (and on some releases you also have to enable the community repository). Since the exploit container doesn’t actually need the Docker client, the simplest fix is to drop that package from the install line and keep only the tools that are required, namely `curl`. Change the Dockerfile to use:

```
FROM alpine:3.13
RUN apk add --no-cache curl   # Docker client removed – not needed for the exploit
COPY exploit.sh /exploit.sh
RUN chmod +x /exploit.sh
```

If you still want the Docker client, replace `docker` with `docker-cli` (and optionally add the community repo), but removing it eliminates the package‑resolution error and lets the image build successfully. After this change, `docker compose up` will bring up the three containers and the exploit script will be able to run against the vulnerable Jetty instance.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Exploit did not succeed (non‑200 response), indicating the container did not achieve its intended function despite being in a running state.
	- ERROR: Exploit did not succeed (non‑200 response), indicating the container did not achieve its intended function despite being in a running state.
	- FIX: The exploit is failing because the Jetty container never serves a WEB‑INF directory for the payload to reach, and the script is trying the request before Jetty is fully ready. To fix it, add a simple web application (for example, mount a directory containing WEB‑INF/web.xml into /var/lib/jetty/webapps/root) to the jetty‑vuln service so that the target file actually exists, and extend the startup pause (or use a health‑check loop) in exploit.sh so the script only sends the request after Jetty reports it’s listening. With a real WEB‑INF tree in place and a reliable “wait‑until‑ready” check, the crafted %2e URL will hit the vulnerable path and the curl call will return a 200 with the file contents.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Exploit failed: HTTP status 404, non‑200 response indicating the target did not respond as expected.
	- ERROR: Exploit failed: HTTP status 404, non‑200 response indicating the target did not respond as expected.
	- FIX: To get the exploit to succeed you need to make sure Jetty actually deploys the test webapp as the ROOT context and that the crafted URL matches the way Jetty normalises the path. Change the volume mapping in the compose file to mount the directory as /var/lib/jetty/webapps/ROOT instead of root so Jetty loads it as the root application, and alter the TARGET_URL in the script to use a double‑encoded traversal (for example http://jetty‑vuln:8080/%2e%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml or http://jetty‑vuln:8080/%2e%2e%2fWEB-INF/web.xml). With the webapp correctly placed and the URL using the proper encoded “..” sequence, Jetty will resolve the request to the protected WEB‑INF file and return a 200 response.


Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!
