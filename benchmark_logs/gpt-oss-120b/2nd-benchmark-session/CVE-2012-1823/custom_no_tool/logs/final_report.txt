----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2012‑1823 is a PHP‑CGI argument injection vulnerability. The CGI version of PHP (php‑cgi) parses the HTTP QUERY_STRING as command‑line arguments. When the query string does not contain an '=' character, the parser fails to skip the php_getopt() handling, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP configuration directives (e.g., -dallow_url_include=1, -dauto_prepend_file=php://input) or other options such as -s to display source code. By sending a crafted request, an attacker can cause the PHP interpreter to include malicious code from the request body or remote locations, leading to full remote code execution on the web server. The flaw affects PHP 5.3 releases prior to 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4 releases prior to 5.4.2 when run as a CGI binary. Exploitation requires a web server that forwards requests to php‑cgi (Apache, Nginx, etc.) and a client capable of sending HTTP requests with specially crafted query strings. Successful exploitation results in disclosure of source files, execution of arbitrary operating‑system commands, and complete compromise of the affected host.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.3.0', '5.3.1', '5.3.2', '5.3.3', '5.3.4', '5.3.5', '5.3.6', '5.3.7', '5.3.8', '5.3.9', '5.3.10', '5.3.11', '5.4.0', '5.4.1']] PHP CGI binary that contains the vulnerable argument‑parsing logic. Running any of the listed versions as a CGI/FastCGI process makes the Docker container vulnerable to CVE‑2012‑1823.
- [SOFT-WEB][httpd][['2.4.54']] Apache HTTP Server used to forward HTTP requests to the php‑cgi binary. Provides the web server environment required for the vulnerability to be reachable.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `php5-cgi` package no longer exists in the Debian stretch‑slim repositories – the distribution ships the CGI binary as `php-cgi` (or `php7.0-cgi`). Replace the line that installs the interpreter with `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apache2 php-cgi` (or explicitly `php7.0-cgi`), and update the symbolic link to point at the actual binary (`ln -s /usr/bin/php-cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5`). With the correct package name the `apt-get` step succeeds and the rest of the Dockerfile can run unchanged, allowing the image to be built successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to enable a CGI configuration that does not exist in the Debian buster‑slim package (`a2enconf serve‑cgi‑bin`). The fix is simply to drop that `a2enconf` line and enable the proper CGI module that ships with the distribution (`a2enmod cgi` or, for newer Apache, `a2enmod cgid`). After removing the non‑existent config enablement, the rest of the steps – creating the CGI bin directory, linking `php‑cgi` to `php5`, copying the site configuration and exposing port 80 – will run without error, and the container will start as expected. In short, delete the `a2enconf serve-cgi-bin` command (or replace it with `a2enmod cgid` if you prefer that module) and rebuild the image.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs php-cgi from the Debian bookworm-slim repository without specifying a version, which provides a modern php version (e.g., 8.x). This does not match any of the listed vulnerable php versions (5.3.0‑5.4.1). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The image does include both php (via php-cgi) and an HTTP server (apache2), satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.

The image does include both php (via php-cgi) and an HTTP server (apache2), satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you must install a PHP‑CGI package whose version falls in the vulnerable 5.3‑5.4 range instead of the default “latest” package from bookworm. The simplest way is to change the base image to an older Debian (e.g., debian:jessie‑slim or debian:stretch‑slim) or to pull the historic php5‑cgi binary from a snapshot repository, and then modify the RUN line to pin the exact version, such as apt‑get install -y php5-cgi=5.4.0‑something. By rebuilding the image with that pinned version the container will contain the vulnerable PHP binary while still providing apache2, thus meeting both the hard‑version and services requirements.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the exact version “php5‑cgi=5.3.3‑7+squeeze1” no longer exists in the current Debian squeeze‑slim repositories, so apt can’t satisfy the package request; simply drop the version pin (or switch to a repository that still carries that old package) and install the generic php5‑cgi package instead. In practice you would modify the Dockerfile RUN line to something like `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apache2 php5-cgi` (or use a newer Debian base that provides the needed PHP 5.3 CGI binary), then rebuild; this resolves the apt‑dependency error and lets the rest of the Dockerfile execute normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Debian squeeze no longer provides the “php5‑cgi” package under that exact name and the Apache CGI module may not be available as “cgi” on that release; to fix it, change the Dockerfile to install the generic CGI package that exists in the repository (for example replace `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apache2 php5-cgi` with `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apache2 php5-cgi-bin` or simply `php5-cgi` if the package is named differently), then adjust the symbolic‑link line to point to the actual binary path (e.g. `ln -s /usr/bin/php5-cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5` becomes `ln -s /usr/bin/php5-cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5` after confirming the binary location with `which php5-cgi`), and finally ensure the CGI module is enabled with the proper name for the distro (use `a2enmod cgid` instead of `a2enmod cgi` if that is the correct module). After these small changes the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Debian jessie base image no longer provides the “php5‑cgi” package under that name, so the apt‑get line can’t find it and the later symlink points to a non‑existent binary. Fix it by switching the PHP package to one that actually exists in Jessie (for example “php5‑cgi” or, on newer repos, just “php‑cgi”), updating the apt‑get command accordingly, and then adjusting the symlink to use the real binary path (e.g. `ln -s /usr/bin/php-cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5`). After those two lines are corrected the rest of the Dockerfile – enabling the CGI module, copying the virtual‑host config, exposing port 80 and launching Apache – will build without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs php‑cgi from the Debian bookworm-slim base. Bookworm ships with PHP 8.x (e.g., 8.2), which is not among the listed vulnerable versions (5.3.0‑5.4.1). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The image does include both PHP (via php‑cgi) and an HTTP daemon (Apache httpd), so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.

	- FIX: To satisfy the hard‑version requirement, replace the current Debian bookworm‑slim base with a release that still provides PHP 5.3/5.4 (for example debian:jessie‑slim) and install the matching php5‑cgi package, or explicitly pin the php‑cgi package to the exact vulnerable version available in an older repository and add the appropriate apt‑source entry. This ensures the container runs a php‑cgi binary in the 5.3‑5.4 range while keeping the existing Apache configuration unchanged, thereby meeting the “code_hard_version” milestone.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the debian:squeeze‑slim image no longer contains the php5‑cgi package (and its path is /usr/bin/php5‑cgi, which the later ln command expects); switching the base to a still‑supported Debian release (for example debian:stretch‑slim or debian:buster‑slim) and installing the current CGI package (e.g. apt‑get install -y php-cgi or php5‑cgi if it exists in that release) resolves the missing‑package error, and the symlink can then point at the actual binary location (adjust the ln target accordingly). Additionally, move the COPY 000-default.conf step before the a2dissite/a2ensite commands (or just enable the site after copying) so the configuration file is present when Apache tries to enable it, and the container will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the stretch‑slim repository no longer contains a generic “php‑cgi” package – it provides version‑specific binaries (e.g. php7.0‑cgi), so the apt‑get line cannot resolve the dependency. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct package (for example `php7.0-cgi`) and point the CGI symlink at the actual binary (`/usr/bin/php7.0-cgi`); the rest of the configuration – enabling the CGI module, copying the virtual‑host file and exposing port 80 – can stay the same, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
