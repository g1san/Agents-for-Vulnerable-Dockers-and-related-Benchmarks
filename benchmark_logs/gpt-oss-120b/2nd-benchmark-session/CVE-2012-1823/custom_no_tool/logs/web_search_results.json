    "desc": "CVE\u20112012\u20111823 is a PHP\u2011CGI argument injection vulnerability. The CGI version of PHP (php\u2011cgi) parses the HTTP QUERY_STRING as command\u2011line arguments. When the query string does not contain an '=' character, the parser fails to skip the php_getopt() handling, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP configuration directives (e.g., -dallow_url_include=1, -dauto_prepend_file=php://input) or other options such as -s to display source code. By sending a crafted request, an attacker can cause the PHP interpreter to include malicious code from the request body or remote locations, leading to full remote code execution on the web server. The flaw affects PHP 5.3 releases prior to 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4 releases prior to 5.4.2 when run as a CGI binary. Exploitation requires a web server that forwards requests to php\u2011cgi (Apache, Nginx, etc.) and a client capable of sending HTTP requests with specially crafted query strings. Successful exploitation results in disclosure of source files, execution of arbitrary operating\u2011system commands, and complete compromise of the affected host.",
