CVE description: CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability in the PHP CGI binary (php‑cgi) that occurs when the interpreter is run as a CGI executable. The flaw resides in the handling of the HTTP query string: if the query string does not contain an “=” character, the PHP CGI parser skips proper option processing and treats the entire string as command‑line arguments. An attacker can inject the `-d` switch (or other PHP configuration directives) directly in the URL, for example `? -d allow_url_include=On -d auto_prepend_file=php://input`. This re‑enables insecure PHP settings and allows the attacker to supply malicious PHP code via the request body, which is then executed with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability permits full remote code execution and source‑code disclosure on any server that exposes php‑cgi directly, such as a mis‑configured Apache, Nginx, or other web servers. Affected PHP versions are 5.3.0 through 5.3.11 and 5.4.0 through 5.4.1. Exploitation requires only the vulnerable php‑cgi endpoint; no authentication or additional services are needed.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.3.0-cli', '5.3.1-cli', '5.3.2-cli', '5.3.3-cli', '5.3.4-cli', '5.3.5-cli', '5.3.6-cli', '5.3.7-cli', '5.3.8-cli', '5.3.9-cli', '5.3.10-cli', '5.3.11-cli', '5.4.0-cli', '5.4.1-cli']] PHP CGI binary (php‑cgi) contains the vulnerable code; specific PHP versions listed are the ones that are vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['latest']] Web server used to expose the php‑cgi endpoint over HTTP; required only to make the Docker environment functional.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the old Debian squeeze image no longer provides the php5‑cgi package, so the “apt‑get install -y php5‑cgi” step cannot succeed; replace the base image with a supported release (for example debian:stretch or debian:buster) and install the current package name (php-cgi). In the php Dockerfile change the FROM line to a newer Debian, update the apt‑cache, then run “apt‑get install -y php-cgi” (or use the official php:5.4‑fpm image and expose port 9000). After that the CMD line can stay the same, and the rest of the compose file will work without further changes.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the debian:buster image no longer provides the php‑cgi package name you’re trying to install, so apt‑get can’t find it and aborts. Change the PHP Dockerfile to use a base image that already contains the CGI binary (for example php:5.3-apache or php:7.3-fpm) or install the correct package name for the current Debian release (e.g. apt‑get install -y php7.3-cgi or php5-cgi if you switch to Debian stretch). After updating the FROM line and the package name, the image will build and the rest of the compose file can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The php service is built from php:7.4‑fpm, which does not contain the vulnerable php‑cgi binary required for CVE‑2012‑1823, so the container starts but the test script never works; replace the base image with an older PHP release that includes php‑cgi (for example php:5.3‑fpm or php:5.4‑fpm), install the php‑cgi package if it isn’t present, and keep the EXPOSE 9000 line so nginx can reach it. After rebuilding the php image and recreating the stack, nginx will be able to forward PHP requests to the correctly versioned php‑cgi process and the container should start normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the **`php5-cgi` package no longer exists in the Debian stretch‑slim repository** that the Dockerfile is using; the current Debian packages are named simply `php-cgi` (or a version‑specific name such as `php7.3-cgi`). To fix the problem, edit the PHP Dockerfile so that the `apt‑get install` line pulls the correct package – for example, replace `php5-cgi` with `php-cgi` (or `php7.4-cgi` if you want a specific version) – and, if you prefer a newer OS base, you can also switch the FROM line to `debian:buster‑slim` or `debian:bullseye‑slim` which contain the updated package. After this change the image will build successfully; the rest of the compose file, Nginx configuration, and the `index.php` payload can stay exactly as they are.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP service is based on the php:5.4‑fpm image, which only runs php‑fpm and does not provide the vulnerable php‑cgi binary that nginx expects to talk to on port 9000, and the Nginx configuration contains a stray space in the location regex that makes it invalid. Change the PHP Dockerfile to use the php:5.4‑cgi (or php:5.4‑apache‑cgi) base image so the php‑cgi binary is present, keep the EXPOSE 9000 line, and remove the space after the tilde in the nginx default.conf location block (use `location ~ \.php$ { … }`). After these two adjustments the images will build and the containers will be able to communicate correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base image `php:5.4‑cgi` does not exist in the official PHP repository, so Docker cannot find a matching tag; replace it with a real image that provides a CGI binary, for example `php:5.4-fpm` (which already runs a FastCGI server on port 9000) and change the start command to `["php-fpm"]` (or keep the default CMD of the fpm image). If you really need the standalone CGI binary, use a later PHP image (e.g., `php:5.6-cli`) and install the `php-cgi` package in the Dockerfile with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y php5-cgi`, then keep the original `CMD ["php-cgi","-b","0.0.0.0:9000"]`. After fixing the base image/tag, the rest of the compose file will build correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the PHP service’s Dockerfile tries to copy index.php from a path that doesn’t exist inside the build context – the file is located one level higher (in ./../../dockers/CVE-2012-1823/custom/php relative to the compose file). Move the index.php into the same directory as the Dockerfile (or adjust the COPY line to COPY ./index.php /var/www/html/index.php) so the file is present when the Docker build runs. Also ensure the PHP‑FPM image can see the FastCGI socket by adding CMD ["php-fpm"] or leaving the default CMD intact, and remove the deprecated links section from the compose file (the depends_on already guarantees ordering). After fixing the copy path and cleaning the compose syntax the images will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the fact that the php:5.4‑fpm‑alpine image tag no longer exists in the official registry, so Docker can’t pull a base image for the PHP container. To fix it, edit ./php/Dockerfile so that it references a tag that is still available (for example php:5.4‑fpm‑alpine3.2 or simply php:5.4‑fpm), then reinstall any missing utilities if you still need the CGI binary (e.g., apk add –no‑cache php5‑cgi). Once the base image resolves, the rest of the Dockerfile – creating /var/www/html, copying index.php and exposing port 9000 – will build correctly and the compose file will start the two services without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `php:5.4-fpm-alpine3.2` image no longer exists in the official registry, so Docker can’t pull it; switching the base image to a tag that does exist (for example `php:5.4-fpm-alpine` or a newer supported PHP 5.4‑fpm image) resolves the pull error. Since the PHP container already copies `index.php` into `/var/www/html`, the bind‑mount defined in the compose file is redundant and can cause a “source not found” error when Docker tries to map a host file that isn’t present; simply remove the `volumes:` entry under `nginx` or replace it with a shared volume that both containers use. With a valid PHP base image and the unnecessary bind‑mount eliminated, the images will build and the stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
