    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability in the PHP CGI binary (php\u2011cgi) that occurs when the interpreter is run as a CGI executable. The flaw resides in the handling of the HTTP query string: if the query string does not contain an \u201c=\u201d character, the PHP CGI parser skips proper option processing and treats the entire string as command\u2011line arguments. An attacker can inject the `-d` switch (or other PHP configuration directives) directly in the URL, for example `? -d allow_url_include=On -d auto_prepend_file=php://input`. This re\u2011enables insecure PHP settings and allows the attacker to supply malicious PHP code via the request body, which is then executed with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability permits full remote code execution and source\u2011code disclosure on any server that exposes php\u2011cgi directly, such as a mis\u2011configured Apache, Nginx, or other web servers. Affected PHP versions are 5.3.0 through 5.3.11 and 5.4.0 through 5.4.1. Exploitation requires only the vulnerable php\u2011cgi endpoint; no authentication or additional services are needed.",
