    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201123897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins Core that affects the built\u2011in Command\u2011Line Interface (CLI). The CLI uses the args4j argument parser, whose \u201c@\u2011file\u201d expansion feature is enabled by default in Jenkins releases up to 2.441 (and LTS releases up to 2.426.2). When a CLI argument contains a token of the form `@/path/to/file`, the parser replaces the token with the contents of the referenced file. An attacker who can reach the Jenkins CLI (via HTTP, TCP, or WebSocket) can therefore cause the Jenkins controller to read any file on its filesystem and return its contents in the CLI response. No authentication is required, and the attacker only needs Overall/Read permission to retrieve full file contents. The vulnerability allows disclosure of configuration files, secret keys, private certificates, and can be chained with other weaknesses to achieve remote code execution, cross\u2011site scripting, or other privileged actions. The fix is to upgrade Jenkins to version 2.442 (or LTS 2.426.3) where the unsafe \u201c@\u2011file\u201d expansion is disabled, or to disable the CLI entirely.",
