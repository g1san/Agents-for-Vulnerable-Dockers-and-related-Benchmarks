{
    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is an arbitrary file\u2011read vulnerability in Jenkins core. The built\u2011in Jenkins Command Line Interface (CLI) uses the args4j library to parse command arguments. When an argument begins with the '@' character, the parser's expandAtFiles() function replaces the token with the contents of the referenced file. In vulnerable Jenkins versions this feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. An attacker who can reach the CLI endpoint (for example via the /cli HTTP interface) can supply a payload such as '@/etc/passwd' and cause the Jenkins controller to read any file on the server and return its contents. The disclosed files may contain secrets (e.g., Jenkins master.key, user config.xml, environment variables) that can be used to forge authentication cookies, perform CSRF, execute stored XSS, or otherwise gain full remote code execution on the Jenkins controller. The vulnerability affects Jenkins core versions up to 2.441 and Jenkins LTS versions up to 2.426.2. It is fixed in Jenkins 2.442, LTS 2.426.3 and LTS 2.440.1, where the '@' file expansion is disabled. The attack requires only network access to the CLI endpoint; no authentication is needed in the default configuration.",
