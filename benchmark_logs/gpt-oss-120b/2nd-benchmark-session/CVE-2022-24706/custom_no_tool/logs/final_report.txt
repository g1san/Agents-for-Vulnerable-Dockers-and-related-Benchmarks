CVE description: Apache CouchDB versions up to and including 3.2.1 (and certain earlier 2.x releases) contain a critical flaw in the Erlang distribution layer. The default installation ships with a well‑known Erlang cookie value ("monster") and binds the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) and the random intra‑cluster distribution port to all network interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the epmd port (TCP 4369) can discover the random distribution port, authenticate using the default cookie, and then issue arbitrary Erlang remote procedure calls that are executed with the privileges of the CouchDB process. This results in full remote code execution and complete administrative control over the CouchDB instance, allowing read, write, delete, cluster manipulation, and execution of arbitrary commands on the host.
Attack Type: Unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][couchdb][['2.3.1', '2.3.2', '2.3.3', '3.0.0', '3.0.1', '3.1.0', '3.1.1', '3.2.0', '3.2.1']] Vulnerable Apache CouchDB instance that includes the insecure default Erlang cookie and exposes the Erlang distribution port via epmd, enabling unauthenticated remote code execution.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only two services: 'web' (based on php:5.6-apache) and 'db' (based on mysql:5.7). No service named 'couchdb' is present, so the required service list ['couchdb'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Consequently, there is no instance of CouchDB to evaluate against the vulnerable version list, meaning no vulnerable CouchDB version is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only two services: 'web' (based on php:5.6-apache) and 'db' (based on mysql:5.7). No service named 'couchdb' is present, so the required service list ['couchdb'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Consequently, there is no instance of CouchDB to evaluate against the vulnerable version list, meaning no vulnerable CouchDB version is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: Add a CouchDB service to the compose file, using an image that runs a patched version (for example couchdb:3.2.2 or later) or a custom image where the Erlang cookie is changed from the default “monster” and the distribution ports are bound only to 127.0.0.1. In the same compose file declare the service under services, give it a name (e.g., couchdb), expose the necessary HTTP port (5984) and optionally the internal epmd port only on localhost, and update any dependent services to reference this CouchDB container instead of assuming its absence. This satisfies the required service list and removes the vulnerable configuration.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state, but the CouchDB logs show repeated errors indicating that the required system database '_users' does not exist. Multiple processes (chttpd_auth_cache, mem3_shards, fabric_doc_open) fail with 'database_does_not_exist' errors, and the auth cache listener repeatedly dies. This misconfiguration prevents proper authentication and normal operation of the database, so the container is not running correctly.

This misconfiguration prevents proper authentication and normal operation of the database, so the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Fix the problem by ensuring the CouchDB container creates the required system databases when it starts. Add a command (or entrypoint script) that runs couchdb -e "couch_mrview:create_system_dbs()." or simply executes curl -X PUT http://admin:adminpass@127.0.0.1:5984/_users after the service is up, and mount that script in the Dockerfile or docker‑compose config with command: ["sh","-c","/init‑couch.sh && couchdb"] so the _users DB is created before any application tries to use it. Also double‑check that COUCHDB_USER and COUCHDB_PASSWORD are set correctly and that the bind address allows the init script to reach the local API. This will eliminate the “database_does_not_exist” errors and restore normal authentication.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The CouchDB service is pulling version 3.2.2, which is not vulnerable to the Erlang‑cookie issue described, but the container still fails because the init script runs before CouchDB is fully ready and the entrypoint expects the database process to be started directly. Change the service definition to launch CouchDB first and then run the init script with a separate command, for example replace the `command` line with `command: ["couchdb"]` and add a `healthcheck` that waits for the HTTP endpoint, then use a `depends_on` condition (`condition: service_healthy`) for a new one‑off “couchdb‑init” service that runs the script. Update `init‑couch.sh` to exit with a non‑zero status on failure and to use `curl -f` so the healthcheck correctly detects readiness. This sequencing ensures CouchDB starts, becomes healthy, and only then the initialization calls are executed, allowing the container to stay up.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile is asking for an obsolete base image (`php:5.6‑apache`) that is no longer available in the official registry; when Docker tries to pull it the pull step aborts and the whole compose run stops. To fix the problem you simply replace the outdated tag with a current, supported php‑apache tag (for example `php:8.2-apache`), leaving the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged—`COPY ./html/ /var/www/html/` still works because the build context is the `web` directory. After updating the `FROM` line, run `docker compose build` again; the image will be pulled successfully and the compose stack will start. If you need the exact PHP 5.6 runtime you would have to build a custom image from an older Debian snapshot, but for most purposes switching to a supported version is the quickest and safest fix.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Add a Compose version line at the top (for example `version: "2.4"`), because without it Docker Compose treats the file as version 1 and rejects the `depends_on` entries that include a `condition:` key. With a version that supports conditions the services will be parsed correctly, and the build will proceed; if you prefer to stay on a version 3 file, simply drop the `condition:` clauses (or replace them with health‑check‑based start ordering) and keep the rest of the YAML unchanged. After updating the version (or removing the unsupported fields) the images will build without the previous parsing error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The failure is coming from the couchdb‑init container: you mount /init‑couch.sh as a read‑only volume ( :ro ) and then immediately try to chmod it in the entrypoint, which Docker cannot do and causes the container to exit with an error. To fix it, either drop the :ro flag when mounting the script or remove the chmod command from the entrypoint since the file is already executable. After making that change, rebuild the stack and the services should start without the termination error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the CouchDB container fails to start is the overriding `command: ["couchdb"]` line; the official CouchDB image already defines the correct entrypoint and starting it with a plain couchdb command bypasses the internal initialization script, so the service never becomes healthy and the dependent containers stay stuck. Delete that `command` directive (or replace it with the default entrypoint if you need to add arguments) and let the image run its built‑in startup sequence; after that the healthcheck will succeed, the couchdb‑init service will be able to reach the HTTP endpoint, and the whole stack should come up normally. If you still see the healthcheck failing, double‑check that the COUCHDB_BIND_ADDRESS environment variable is set to 0.0.0.0 so the internal curl to 127.0.0.1 works, but typically just removing the custom command resolves the issue.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The CouchDB service is pulling the non‑vulnerable 3.2.2 tag, so the container never exposes the Erlang distribution ports (4369 / the random intra‑cluster port) that the exploit relies on, and the default “monster” cookie isn’t being set. Change the image to a vulnerable release (e.g., couchdb:3.2.1), add a mapping for the epmd port, and set the Erlang cookie explicitly; the health‑check can stay the same. In practice you would edit docker‑compose.yml so the couchdb service reads:

```yaml
couchdb:
  image: couchdb:3.2.1
  environment:
    - COUCHDB_USER=admin
    - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=adminpass
    - COUCHDB_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
    - COUCHDB_COOKIE=monster
  ports:
    - "5984:5984"
    - "4369:4369"
```

and make the same image/tag change for the couchdb‑init service. After redeploying, the container will start correctly and expose the ports needed for the CVE‑2022‑24706 scenario.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is caused by the startup ordering – the web service is launched before the database services are truly ready, so its dependent containers (especially the couchdb‑init script) fail to connect and the whole stack ends up in a crash loop. Fix it by adding a proper healthcheck to the MySQL container (for example, `test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]`) and then change the `depends_on` clauses for both `web` and `couchdb-init` to use `condition: service_healthy` for the `db` service instead of `service_started`. Also adjust the CouchDB healthcheck to query `http://localhost:5984/_up` (which works inside the container) rather than the external address, ensuring the container is marked healthy only after the HTTP API is actually responding. After these changes the services will wait for each other in the correct order and the failing container will start correctly.
