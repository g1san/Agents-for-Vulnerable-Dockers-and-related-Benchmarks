    "desc": "Apache CouchDB versions up to and including 3.2.1 (and certain earlier 2.x releases) contain a critical flaw in the Erlang distribution layer. The default installation ships with a well\u2011known Erlang cookie value (\"monster\") and binds the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (epmd) and the random intra\u2011cluster distribution port to all network interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the epmd port (TCP 4369) can discover the random distribution port, authenticate using the default cookie, and then issue arbitrary Erlang remote procedure calls that are executed with the privileges of the CouchDB process. This results in full remote code execution and complete administrative control over the CouchDB instance, allowing read, write, delete, cluster manipulation, and execution of arbitrary commands on the host.",
