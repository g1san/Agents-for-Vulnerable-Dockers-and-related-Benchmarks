CVE description: CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB versions up to and including 3.2.1. The default installation of CouchDB starts the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD) on TCP port 4369 and a randomly chosen Erlang distribution port that is bound to all network interfaces. The packaging also used a fixed default Erlang cookie value of "monster" for node‑to‑node authentication. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the EPMD service can query it to discover the random distribution port, authenticate using the known cookie, and then communicate with the Erlang VM. By sending specially crafted Erlang messages, the attacker can invoke the `os:cmd/1` function, resulting in remote code execution with the privileges of the CouchDB process. This gives the attacker full administrative control over the database and the underlying host, allowing data theft, modification, or further lateral movement. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading to CouchDB 3.2.2 or later, changing the default cookie, and restricting access to the EPMD and distribution ports.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not include a couchdb service; only mysql, php, and phpmyadmin are defined. Therefore the required service list ['couchdb'] is not present, and no couchdb version from the allowed list is used, causing both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition does not include a couchdb service; only mysql, php, and phpmyadmin are defined. Therefore the required service list ['couchdb'] is not present, and no couchdb version from the allowed list is used, causing both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: Add a CouchDB service definition to the docker‑compose.yml using a patched image (for example couchdb:3.2.2) and expose only the internal port (4369 and the distribution port should not be published to the host). Set a custom Erlang cookie by adding an environment variable COUCHDB_COOKIE=yourSecretValue and bind the CouchDB data directory to a named volume. After inserting the new service, the compose file will contain the required couchdb service with an allowed version, satisfying the service‑list requirement while keeping the existing MySQL‑PHP‑phpMyAdmin stack unchanged.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker reports the container as 'running', but the CouchDB logs show repeated fatal errors: the _users system database is missing, causing the chttpd_auth_cache listener to die repeatedly (error "database_does_not_exist" for _users). These errors prevent proper authentication and indicate that CouchDB is not fully operational despite the container state being up.

These errors prevent proper authentication and indicate that CouchDB is not fully operational despite the container state being up.
	- FIX: Fix the problem by ensuring CouchDB creates its internal system databases at start‑up. Change the service definition to set the required admin credentials before the database runs (use COUCHDB_USER, COUCHDB_PASSWORD and also COUCHDB_SECRET so the node cookie is generated correctly) and add a small initialization script that runs after the container boots to create the _users database if it does not exist. For example, mount a custom local config file that sets “couchdb –admin-user admin –admin-password adminpass” and then, in a Docker‑entrypoint‑override script, execute “curl -X PUT http://admin:adminpass@localhost:5984/_users” once the HTTP service is ready. Remove the manual COUCHDB_COOKIE variable and let CouchDB generate a fresh cookie, or set COUCHDB_SECRET to a strong value. After these changes, restart the stack; CouchDB will start with a valid _users system database and authentication will work.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The CouchDB container never stays up because the custom `couchdb_init.sh` script daemonises CouchDB with `couchdb -b` and then tries to launch it again via `exec couchdb`; the second start fails on the already‑bound ports and the container exits. Remove the background launch and let the script start CouchDB only once in the foreground after the initialization steps—replace `couchdb -b` with just `couchdb` (or omit the whole script and rely on the image’s default entrypoint) and keep the `exec couchdb` line so the process remains the container’s PID 1. After this change the CouchDB service will stay running and the compose stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The CouchDB container is failing because the custom entrypoint runs the daemon twice: the script first launches CouchDB in the background (`-b`) and then, after the health‑check loop, execs a second instance, which conflicts with the already‑running process and prevents the container from staying alive. To fix it, remove the background start line and let the script simply wait for the service to become reachable, then exec the binary once; that way the container has a single CouchDB process that remains in the foreground. Also ensure the script is executable (chmod +x) and that the entrypoint points to the script without overriding the default command, so Docker will run the script as the container’s main process. After applying these changes the CouchDB service should start correctly and the whole stack will come up.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running (State.Running = true) but the CouchDB logs show repeated fatal errors: the system database _users is missing, leading to repeated "database_does_not_exist" errors and the chttpd_auth_cache listener repeatedly dying. These errors indicate that CouchDB cannot function correctly (authentication cache cannot be created), so the container is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running (State.Running = true) but the CouchDB logs show repeated fatal errors: the system database _users is missing, leading to repeated "database_does_not_exist" errors and the chttpd_auth_cache listener repeatedly dying. These errors indicate that CouchDB cannot function correctly (authentication cache cannot be created), so the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: Fix the problem by forcing CouchDB to start with a clean data directory and by using the proper administrative‑user environment variable that triggers automatic creation of the system databases. Remove the persistent couchdb_data volume (or delete its contents) so that a fresh “_users” database can be generated, then replace the COUCHDB_USER and COUCHDB_PASSWORD variables with the supported COUCHDB_ADMINISTRATORS JSON format (e.g., COUCHDB_ADMINISTRATORS: '{"admin":"adminpass"}' ). This causes the official entrypoint to initialise the required system databases on first start, eliminating the repeated “database_does_not_exist” and auth‑cache failures. If you still need a custom init step, add a short‑lived entrypoint script that waits for port 5984 to be up and then runs curl -X PUT http://admin:adminpass@localhost:5984/_users to ensure the database exists.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The container crashes because the custom `entrypoint` replaces the official CouchDB start‑up logic, deletes the data directory that the image expects to own, and then tries to launch CouchDB with the undocumented `couchdb -b` flag; the script also never gets into the image (no volume‑mount) so the entrypoint file isn’t found at run time.  
Fix it by removing the `entrypoint:` line from the `couchdb` service, letting the official image’s entrypoint initialise the database, and instead add a simple `command:` that runs a short‑lived init script after the server is up (or mount the script into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` so the built‑in init mechanism can execute it). Also make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x couchdb_entrypoint.sh`). After those changes the compose file will build and start without the start‑up error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The CouchDB service is failing because the default Erlang cookie (“monster”) and the EPMD distribution port are left open, which the official image now expects to be set explicitly; modify the couchdb service definition to add an environment variable ERLANG_COOKIE with a strong random value and expose the EPMD port (4369) so the container can start its Erlang node, then restart the stack – this will let CouchDB initialize correctly and the container will stay up. Additionally, ensure the couchdb_entrypoint.sh script is not referenced in the compose file (the official entrypoint is sufficient) and that the COUCHDB_ADMINISTRATORS value is quoted correctly (use single quotes around the JSON string) to avoid JSON‑parsing errors. After these changes, run docker compose up -d to bring the containers up again.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The CouchDB service is failing because you are still running the vulnerable 3.2.1 image with the default EPMD listener exposed on port 4369; the image also expects a random Erlang distribution port to be bound, which isn’t being mapped and causes the container to abort. Change the couchdb service to use a patched version (≥ 3.2.2), remove the explicit “4369:4369” port mapping (or bind it only to localhost) and let the official entrypoint generate a fresh Erlang cookie (or keep the strong value you already set). After updating the image tag and cleaning up the port exposure, run docker‑compose up again and the container should start correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running (State.Status='running'), but CouchDB fails to initialize required system databases. Logs show repeated errors: "Missing system database _users" and "database_does_not_exist" errors from chttpd_auth_cache, causing the auth cache listener to die repeatedly. These errors indicate the service is not fully functional, so the container is not running correctly.

These errors indicate the service is not fully functional, so the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Fix the CouchDB service by correcting the admin‑user environment variable and ensuring a persistent data volume so the built‑in init can create the system databases. Replace the line `COUCHDB_ADMINISTRATORS: '{"admin":"adminpass"}'` with the proper format `COUCHDB_ADMINISTRATORS: {"admin":"adminpass"}` (no surrounding quotes) and remove the unused `COUCHDB_USER`/`COUCHDB_PASSWORD` entries, because the official image only uses the JSON admin definition. Add a volume mapping (for example `- couchdb_data:/opt/couchdb/data`) under the couchdb service and declare `couchdb_data:` in the top‑level volumes section. With a correct admin definition and persistent storage, the container will run the internal init script, automatically create the required `_users` and `_replicator` system databases, and the auth cache listener will stay alive.
