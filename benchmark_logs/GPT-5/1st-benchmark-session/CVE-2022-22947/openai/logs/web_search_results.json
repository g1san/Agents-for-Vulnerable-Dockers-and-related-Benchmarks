    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway. When an application uses Spring Cloud Gateway and exposes the Spring Boot Actuator 'gateway' endpoint over HTTP without authentication/authorization, user-supplied Spring Expression Language (SpEL) in route management is evaluated with a permissive context, allowing invocation of arbitrary Java methods. Affected versions include 3.1.0, 3.0.0 through 3.0.6, and older unsupported versions. Fixed in 3.1.1+ and 3.0.7+. Mitigations: upgrade, disable the actuator Gateway endpoint, or secure it (e.g., with Spring Security).",
