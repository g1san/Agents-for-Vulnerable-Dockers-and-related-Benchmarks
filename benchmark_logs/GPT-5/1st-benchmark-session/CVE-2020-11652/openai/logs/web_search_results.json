    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a directory traversal (CWE-22) in Salt\u2019s salt-master ClearFuncs that fails to sanitize user-controlled path elements, allowing traversal outside intended directories and arbitrary file read on the master. The vulnerable surface is reachable over the master\u2019s ZeroMQ ports (TCP 4505/4506); the HTTP NetAPI is not required. Affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000.x before 3000.2. Frequently chained with CVE-2020-11651 to bypass auth and enable unauthenticated exploitation; observed exploited in the wild.",
