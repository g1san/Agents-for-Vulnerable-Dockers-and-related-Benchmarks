    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is a flaw in Joomla! 4\u2019s Web Services (REST API) caused by improper access control. In affected releases (Joomla 4.0.0 through 4.2.7), certain API endpoints can be queried without authentication when the site is reachable over Hypertext Transfer Protocol, allowing anyone on the network or Internet to retrieve sensitive information that should be restricted. The issue exists in the core Joomla application; no extension or third\u2011party plugin is required. The most impactful exposed endpoints include the configuration API and the users API. Requests such as /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true can disclose the site configuration, including database host, username, password, and database name. Requests such as /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true can disclose usernames, email addresses, and group memberships, which may include the \u201cSuper Users\u201d administrator group. Because the vulnerable functionality is part of Joomla\u2019s core web service, exploitation requires only network access to the Joomla site\u2019s API endpoints; no prior login or user interaction is needed. The immediate impact is unauthorized disclosure of critical configuration and identity data. The practical risk is higher because the leaked database credentials may permit direct access to the backing database (for example, MySQL) if it is reachable, enabling an attacker to manipulate site data such as resetting a Super User password. Even without database reachability, the leaked user list can facilitate password guessing against the administrator login. Gaining Super User access enables full site control and typical post\u2011exploitation actions through legitimate administrative features, such as modifying templates or installing extensions, which can lead to server\u2011side code execution. The vulnerability affects only Joomla 4; it was remediated in Joomla 4.2.8 and later by tightening access checks on the relevant web service endpoints. Mitigations include updating Joomla to 4.2.8 or newer and restricting external exposure of the web service endpoints if an upgrade cannot be performed immediately.",
