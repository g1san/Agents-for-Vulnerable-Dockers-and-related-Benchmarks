CVE description: CVE-2023-23752 is a flaw in Joomla! 4’s Web Services (REST API) caused by improper access control. In affected releases (Joomla 4.0.0 through 4.2.7), certain API endpoints can be queried without authentication when the site is reachable over Hypertext Transfer Protocol, allowing anyone on the network or Internet to retrieve sensitive information that should be restricted. The issue exists in the core Joomla application; no extension or third‑party plugin is required. The most impactful exposed endpoints include the configuration API and the users API. Requests such as /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true can disclose the site configuration, including database host, username, password, and database name. Requests such as /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true can disclose usernames, email addresses, and group memberships, which may include the “Super Users” administrator group. Because the vulnerable functionality is part of Joomla’s core web service, exploitation requires only network access to the Joomla site’s API endpoints; no prior login or user interaction is needed. The immediate impact is unauthorized disclosure of critical configuration and identity data. The practical risk is higher because the leaked database credentials may permit direct access to the backing database (for example, MySQL) if it is reachable, enabling an attacker to manipulate site data such as resetting a Super User password. Even without database reachability, the leaked user list can facilitate password guessing against the administrator login. Gaining Super User access enables full site control and typical post‑exploitation actions through legitimate administrative features, such as modifying templates or installing extensions, which can lead to server‑side code execution. The vulnerability affects only Joomla 4; it was remediated in Joomla 4.2.8 and later by tightening access checks on the relevant web service endpoints. Mitigations include updating Joomla to 4.2.8 or newer and restricting external exposure of the web service endpoints if an upgrade cannot be performed immediately.
Attack Type: Information disclosure through authentication bypass caused by improper access control, enabling unauthorized retrieval of configuration and user data with potential for follow-on privilege escalation
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][joomla][['4.0.0---4.2.7', '4.2.7-apache']] Joomla core application exposing the vulnerable Web Services API over HTTP. Versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7 contain the improper access check that allows unauthenticated disclosure.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Relational database required for a functional Joomla 4 deployment. Stores configuration and user data that the vulnerable API may disclose; also enables realistic end-to-end testing of the impact if database credentials are leaked.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
