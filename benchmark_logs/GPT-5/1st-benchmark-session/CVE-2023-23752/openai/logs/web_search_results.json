    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an improper access control flaw in Joomla! CMS 4.x (versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7; fixed in 4.2.8 on 2023-02-16). Joomla 4 introduced a core REST API under /api/index.php. For certain routes, appending the query parameter public=true causes requests to be treated as if they were allowed for unauthenticated users due to missing/insufficient authorization checks in the API router handling of \u201cpublic GETs.\u201d This enables remote, unauthenticated access to endpoints that should require authentication. Notably, /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true can disclose application configuration including plaintext database credentials; other endpoints like /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true and various component routes are also exposed. The issue is documented by Joomla\u2019s advisory and NVD, and appears in CISA\u2019s KEV catalog, indicating exploitation in the wild. Reported by Zewei Zhang (NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab); Joomla released 4.2.8 on 2023-02-16. Frequently cited IOCs/URLs include /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true and /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true; Joomla\u2019s webserver-level mitigations explicitly target api/index.php/v1/ with the public query string. Minimal reproduction requires only Joomla (Apache+PHP variant) and a relational database (e.g., MySQL). References: developer.joomla.org; nvd.nist.gov; docs.joomla.org; sysevil.github.io; wiz.io.",
