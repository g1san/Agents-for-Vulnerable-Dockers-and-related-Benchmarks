    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical remote code execution flaw in Spring Cloud Function\u2019s HTTP routing feature. In affected versions (3.1.x before 3.1.7 and 3.2.0\u20133.2.2), a user-supplied routing value (commonly via the spring.cloud.function.routing-expression HTTP header) is evaluated as a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression in an overly permissive evaluation context, allowing attacker-controlled expression evaluation and method invocation. When applications expose the function router over HTTP (often /functionRouter), an attacker can send a malicious routing expression to execute arbitrary code, fully compromising the host. The fix restricts header parsing/evaluation via a hardened evaluation context. This issue is distinct from CVE-2022-22965 (Spring Framework) and only requires that the app uses Spring Cloud Function\u2019s HTTP routing. It has been observed in the wild and commonly rated CVSS 9.8.",
