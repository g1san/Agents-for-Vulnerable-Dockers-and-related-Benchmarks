    "desc": "A packaging/configuration flaw in Apache CouchDB allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to reach privileged functionality via the Erlang distribution channel when default packaging left the Erlang cookie at its default value and epmd (port 4369) plus the runtime-selected Erlang distribution port are reachable. Affects CouchDB versions prior to 3.2.2 (3.2.1 and below). In practice, this enables unauthenticated admin takeover of CouchDB and, in many setups, remote code execution through Erlang distribution. Fixed in 3.2.2 by requiring a non-default cookie and binding epmd/distribution to localhost by default. Classified as CWE-1188; CVSS 9.8; listed in CISA KEV.",
