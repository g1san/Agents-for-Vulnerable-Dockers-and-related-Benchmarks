CVE description: A packaging/configuration flaw in Apache CouchDB allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to reach privileged functionality via the Erlang distribution channel when default packaging left the Erlang cookie at its default value and epmd (port 4369) plus the runtime-selected Erlang distribution port are reachable. Affects CouchDB versions prior to 3.2.2 (3.2.1 and below). In practice, this enables unauthenticated admin takeover of CouchDB and, in many setups, remote code execution through Erlang distribution. Fixed in 3.2.2 by requiring a non-default cookie and binding epmd/distribution to localhost by default. Classified as CWE-1188; CVSS 9.8; listed in CISA KEV.
Attack Type: Unauthenticated remote privilege escalation (admin takeover); potential remote code execution via Erlang distribution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][couchdb][['1.7.2-3.2.1', '1.7.2', '2.3.1', '3.1.2', '3.2.0', '3.2.1']] Official Apache CouchDB service; contains Erlang runtime and epmd. Running pre-3.2.2 tags with default settings reproduces the vulnerability and is sufficient to create a testable vulnerable system.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The compose parser failed with: "yaml: line 3: mapping values are not allowed in this context". The docker-compose.yml file contained a non-YAML header line ("docker-compose.yml") at the top, causing the YAML to be invalid. YAML must start with a mapping like "version:"; any stray text before that breaks parsing.
	- FIX: Removed the stray header line so the file begins with the version mapping. Kept the service definition constrained to the allowed CouchDB versions for CVE-2022-24706 (using couchdb:3.2.1). No other structural changes were needed. The resulting compose file is immediately deployable with "docker compose up".

Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- ERROR: The compose file contains two non-YAML lines at the top (a banner and an echoed path), which causes the YAML parser to fail with: yaml: line 3: mapping values are not allowed in this context.
	- FIX: Remove both non-YAML prefix lines so the file starts at the compose document. Additionally, switch to the modern Compose Spec format by omitting the deprecated top-level 'version' key. Keep only the allowed service (couchdb:3.2.1) and its configuration.

Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
