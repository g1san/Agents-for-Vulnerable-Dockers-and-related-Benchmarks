    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 affects Eclipse Jetty 9.4.37\u20139.4.42, 10.0.1\u201310.0.5, and 11.0.1\u201311.0.5. A request-routing flaw in path decoding/normalization allows crafted request-target URIs with certain encodings to bypass security constraints and expose protected resources (e.g., files under WEB-INF). Confidentiality is impacted; integrity and availability are not directly affected (CVSS v3.1 base 5.3). Root cause involves altered decode/normalize order and alias handling leading to canonicalization differences; fixed in 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6. This is a variant of CVE-2021-28164 and prompted downstream dependency updates in projects like Kafka, ZooKeeper, and HBase.",
