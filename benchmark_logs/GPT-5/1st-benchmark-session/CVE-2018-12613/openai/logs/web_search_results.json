    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 affects phpMyAdmin and stems from flawed internal page-loading/redirect logic combined with an improper whitelist check. This enables server-side file inclusion, allowing an attacker to have phpMyAdmin include and render arbitrary files on the server; in some configurations this can escalate to remote code execution. By default, authentication is required, but if $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] is true or $cfg['ServerDefault'] is set to 0, the vulnerable code path can be reached without prior login. Affected versions are phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 (NVD: 4.8.x before 4.8.2). The issue was fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.8.2 and is scored high severity (e.g., CVSS 3.1 base 8.8).",
