----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2018-12613 affects phpMyAdmin and stems from flawed internal page-loading/redirect logic combined with an improper whitelist check. This enables server-side file inclusion, allowing an attacker to have phpMyAdmin include and render arbitrary files on the server; in some configurations this can escalate to remote code execution. By default, authentication is required, but if $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] is true or $cfg['ServerDefault'] is set to 0, the vulnerable code path can be reached without prior login. Affected versions are phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 (NVD: 4.8.x before 4.8.2). The issue was fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.8.2 and is scored high severity (e.g., CVSS 3.1 base 8.8).
Attack Type: Server-side file inclusion leading to arbitrary file read and, depending on configuration, remote code execution; possible authentication bypass of the vulnerable code path under specific phpMyAdmin settings.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] Vulnerable application. Official phpMyAdmin image that includes Apache and PHP (no separate web server needed). Vulnerable range noted by NVD as 4.8.x before 4.8.2; vendor lists 4.8.0 and 4.8.1.
- [SOFT][mariadb][['10.3']] Relational database required for normal phpMyAdmin operation (compatible with phpMyAdmin 4.8.x). An alternative would be mysql:5.7, but only one DB service is needed.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
