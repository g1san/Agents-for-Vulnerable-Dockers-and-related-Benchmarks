    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal flaw in Grafana\u2019s public plugin asset handler that allows remote, unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files on the Grafana server via crafted paths under /public/plugins/<plugin-id>/. Because default Grafana installations include plugins, these endpoints are reachable without authentication. Impact: unauthorized disclosure of local files; integrity and availability are not directly affected. Affected Grafana versions: 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0. Fixed in 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, and 8.3.1 (and later). CVSS v3.1 base score: 7.5 (High).",
