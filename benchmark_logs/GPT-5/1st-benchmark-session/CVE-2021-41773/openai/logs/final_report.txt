----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2021-41773 is a path normalization flaw introduced in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 that allows crafted traversal paths to escape Alias-like directories and access files outside the intended directory tree if not explicitly protected (e.g., missing "Require all denied"). When CGI execution is enabled on the aliased path, the traversal can reach executable scripts and lead to remote code execution. The issue was exploited in the wild. Apacheâ€™s first fix in 2.4.50 was incomplete (CVE-2021-42013); the complete fix is in 2.4.51. Only 2.4.49 is affected (NVD CVSS v3.1 base 7.5).
Attack Type: Directory traversal/file disclosure; possible remote code execution when CGI is enabled for the aliased path.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][httpd][['2.4.49', '2.4.49-buster', '2.4.49-alpine']] Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 is required to expose the vulnerable path normalization behavior. A single-container httpd service with an Alias-like mapping can reproduce file disclosure; enabling CGI on that path can demonstrate RCE conditions.
