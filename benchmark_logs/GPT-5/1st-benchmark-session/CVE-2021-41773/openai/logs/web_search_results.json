    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a path normalization flaw introduced in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 that allows crafted traversal paths to escape Alias-like directories and access files outside the intended directory tree if not explicitly protected (e.g., missing \"Require all denied\"). When CGI execution is enabled on the aliased path, the traversal can reach executable scripts and lead to remote code execution. The issue was exploited in the wild. Apache\u2019s first fix in 2.4.50 was incomplete (CVE-2021-42013); the complete fix is in 2.4.51. Only 2.4.49 is affected (NVD CVSS v3.1 base 7.5).",
