    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins core\u2019s built-in command-line interface. Jenkins relies on the args4j parser, which supports an \u201cexpandAtFiles\u201d feature that replaces an @-prefixed file path in CLI arguments with the file\u2019s contents. In affected versions, this feature was not disabled, allowing crafted CLI arguments to cause Jenkins to read files from the controller filesystem under the controller process user and inject that content into command processing. This yields arbitrary file read on the controller. Users with Overall/Read permission can read entire files; users without it can still read at least the first few lines of files. Reading binary files is possible but may suffer character-encoding loss; on Windows-1252 far fewer bytes are lost compared to UTF-8, making secret reconstruction more feasible. Beyond arbitrary file read, Jenkins identified concrete post-read attack paths that can lead to remote code execution in certain conditions, including via the Resource Root URL feature, forging \u201cRemember me\u201d cookies after recovering cryptographic material, stored XSS in build logs abusing serialized console notes, and CSRF protection bypass when crumbs can be forged. Additional impacts include decrypting stored secrets, deleting items, and downloading Java heap dumps when specific prerequisites are met. Affected versions include Jenkins weekly 2.441 and earlier (fixed in 2.442) and Jenkins LTS 2.426.2 and earlier (fixed in 2.426.3, with an additional fixed LTS 2.440.1). Public proof-of-concepts exist, and the issue has been added to CISA\u2019s KEV catalog, indicating active exploitation. A single-container setup is sufficient to expose the vulnerable surface: the CLI is reachable over HTTP(S)/WebSocket via the embedded Jetty/Winstone servlet container, and the official Docker images expose the WebSocket CLI endpoint by default.",
