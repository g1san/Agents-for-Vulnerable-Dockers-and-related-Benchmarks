CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a widely exploited flaw in Laravel’s debugging error handler, Ignition. When a Laravel application runs with debugging enabled (APP_DEBUG=true) and the Ignition debug endpoints are reachable, an unauthenticated attacker can abuse the way Ignition’s “execute solution” feature handles file operations. In vulnerable releases, the Facade\Ignition\Solutions\MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution (reachable via endpoints such as /_ignition/execute-solution) invokes PHP file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() on attacker-influenced inputs without sufficient validation. This unsafe file access lets an attacker write controlled data into application files, most notably the Laravel log at storage/logs/laravel.log.

From there, the flaw can be escalated into full process compromise by leveraging PHP’s phar:// stream wrapper and the application’s typical logging stack. A common exploitation path is: (1) poison the Laravel log with bytes that, when interpreted as a PHAR archive, contain a serialized object payload; (2) coerce the application to read that log via phar:// so that PHP’s metadata parsing triggers object deserialization; (3) exploit a gadget chain present by default in Laravel’s Monolog dependency to execute system commands. Several public proofs of concept demonstrate that no prior authentication is required, provided the Ignition debug handler is exposed. 

Conditions for exposure: Laravel applications prior to 8.4.2 using Ignition before 2.5.2 with debugging enabled and Ignition’s endpoints accessible. The impact is severe: unauthenticated remote code execution in the web server’s context, enabling full takeover of the application, access to attached data stores, and pivoting within the environment. Mitigations include upgrading Ignition to 2.5.2 or later and Laravel to 8.4.2 or later, disabling debugging in production, and restricting access to Ignition’s endpoints.

Most reliable sources (e.g., NVD) state affected components as Ignition before 2.5.2, and Laravel prior to 8.4.2 when debug mode is on. Public research (Ambionics disclosure and others) documents the phar:// and Monolog gadget-chain technique that turns the file operation weakness into code execution. PHP itself is not the vulnerable component, but a PHP runtime with the phar stream wrapper enabled is a prerequisite for practical exploitation.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['7.3-apache', '7.4-apache', '8.0-apache']] Single-container runtime that provides both the web server (Apache via the -apache tags) and the PHP interpreter required to run a Laravel application exposing Ignition. PHP with the phar stream wrapper enabled is essential for turning the Ignition file operation flaw into deserialization and code execution via phar://. While PHP itself is not the vulnerable component, this service is indispensable to make the system vulnerable because it executes the affected Laravel/ Ignition code. To actually be vulnerable inside this container, install Laravel versions prior to 8.4.2 together with Ignition versions before 2.5.2 (per NVD) and run with APP_DEBUG=true so the Ignition debug endpoints are exposed.
- [SOFT][composer][['2.2']] Dependency manager used at build time to install the specific vulnerable application stack inside the php container (e.g., laravel/framework ≤ 8.4.1 and facade/ignition < 2.5.2 as cited by NVD). Not required at runtime, but needed to assemble a working Laravel app with the exact vulnerable versions. This is a supportive role only and can run as part of a multi-stage build or a one-off container.
