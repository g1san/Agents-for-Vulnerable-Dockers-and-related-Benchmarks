CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a critical vulnerability in the Ignition error page/debugging package used by Laravel. In affected releases, Ignition’s debug helpers handle requests insecurely and use file_get_contents and file_put_contents in ways that allow an unauthenticated network client to coerce server-side file reads/writes via the debug interface, leading to arbitrary code execution when the application runs in debug mode (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129). Exploitability requires debug mode to be exposed; NVD notes it is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129). Affected package versions: Ignition before 2.5.2, including 2.5.0–2.5.1, 2.0.0–2.4.1, 1.7.0–1.16.13, and anything before 1.6.15; patched releases are 2.5.2, 2.4.2, 1.16.14, and 1.6.15 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129; https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4qwp-7c67-jmcc). Impact: unauthenticated remote code execution with CVSS v3.1 base score 9.8 Critical; this issue has been known to be exploited in the wild (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129). Root cause: insecure request handling in Ignition’s debug helpers allowing user-controlled filesystem operations that can be interpreted for code execution; the debug endpoint is the entry point when debug mode is on (https://www.ambionics.io/blog/laravel-debug-rce; https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129). No database, cache, queue, or reverse proxy is required to reach this flaw; the default Laravel welcome page or any route that triggers an exception is sufficient to surface Ignition in debug mode (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129).
Attack Type: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['php:8.0-apache']] Single required runtime to expose a vulnerable Laravel app over HTTP. The php:8.0-apache image bundles Apache HTTP Server with mod_php, so one container can serve Laravel 8. The vulnerability resides in the application layer (Laravel + facade/ignition) and is reachable when debug mode is enabled; no database, cache, queue, or separate reverse proxy is needed. Ensure the app’s vendor tree contains a vulnerable Ignition version (1.0.0–1.6.14, 1.7.0–1.16.13, 2.0.0–2.4.1, or 2.5.0–2.5.1) and that the Laravel framework is before 8.4.2 to expose the affected integration in debug mode (NVD: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129; GHSA: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4qwp-7c67-jmcc).
- [SOFT][composer][['composer:2']] Optional helper used during image build to install specific Laravel and Ignition versions with Composer; not required at runtime once vendor dependencies are present.
