    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) caused by an incomplete fix for the earlier CVE-2021-41773. It affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 only. The flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to perform path traversal by crafting specific request paths so that the server maps URLs to files located outside the intended directories configured through Alias-like directives. Under normal, secure configurations, non-public locations are protected by a default access control of \u201cRequire all denied.\u201d However, if those external locations are not protected by that default (for example, because access controls were relaxed with \u201cRequire all granted\u201d or similar configuration), the attacker can successfully access files outside the document root or other intended directories, leading to unintended file disclosure. In environments where the Common Gateway Interface is enabled (for example, via mod_cgi or mod_cgid) for the affected aliased paths, the vulnerability can escalate from file disclosure to the execution of arbitrary code by invoking or reaching executable scripts outside of the intended scope. The issue is exploitable remotely without authentication or user interaction, and it stems from improper canonicalization and validation of request paths during the mapping process for Alias-like directives. Affected versions are limited to 2.4.49 and 2.4.50; earlier releases are not affected, and the issue is corrected in 2.4.51 and later. Recommended mitigations include upgrading to 2.4.51 or newer, ensuring that non-public directories are explicitly protected by \u201cRequire all denied,\u201d and avoiding enabling Common Gateway Interface on aliased paths unless strictly necessary and carefully controlled.",

Using version 2.4.49 or 2.4.50 with an Alias-like directive and insufficient access controls makes the system vulnerable to path traversal; enabling Common Gateway Interface (e.g., mod_cgi/mod_cgid) within this same service can allow escalation to remote code execution. No additional services are required to create a working and testable vulnerable Docker setup."
