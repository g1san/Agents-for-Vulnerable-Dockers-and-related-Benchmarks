    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is an Apache HTTP Server vulnerability where the initial fix for CVE-2021-41773 was incomplete, allowing crafted request paths to bypass path normalization. Under specific configurations, attackers can traverse outside intended directories and, if CGI is enabled on an Alias/ScriptAlias-mapped path, execute programs as CGI, resulting in RCE. Only versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 are affected; 2.4.51 and later are fixed. Practical exploitation requires an Alias-like or ScriptAlias mapping (DocumentRoot alone is not sufficient), relaxed filesystem access controls for file reads (default \u201cRequire all denied\u201d would prevent reads), and CGI enabled (mod_cgi or mod_cgid) for the mapped path to enable RCE. The issue is listed in CISA\u2019s KEV; remediation is to upgrade to 2.4.51+.",
