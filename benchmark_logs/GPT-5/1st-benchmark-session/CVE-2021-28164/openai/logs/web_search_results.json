    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is an information disclosure flaw in the Eclipse Jetty web server affecting versions 9.4.37.v20210219 and 9.4.38.v20210224 (fixed in 9.4.39.v20210325). In these releases, Jetty\u2019s default compliance mode handled percent-encoded dot segments (such as %2e and %2e%2e) in a way that allowed authorization checks to occur before full URI parsing and canonicalization. This \u201cauthorization before parsing/canonicalization\u201d caused paths containing encoded dot segments to bypass protections around special locations like WEB-INF. As a result, unauthenticated remote users could access files intended to be non-web-accessible, e.g., /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml. Impact is limited to exposure of sensitive information (e.g., web.xml, taglibs, config files); integrity/availability are not directly affected. Preconditions: run an affected Jetty build in default compliance mode with any standard Java webapp containing a WEB-INF directory; no reverse proxy or additional components are required. Remediation: upgrade to 9.4.39+ or configure jetty.http.compliance=RFC7230_NO_AMBIGUOUS_URIS as a mitigation on affected builds. A related issue, CVE-2021-34429, later expanded the encoded-path variant and was fixed in 9.4.43/10.0.6/11.0.6. Many downstream products embedding Jetty were indirectly impacted.
