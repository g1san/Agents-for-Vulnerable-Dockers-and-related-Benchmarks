    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical authentication-bypass flaw in Salt\u2019s master (salt-master) request server. The ClearFuncs class failed to properly restrict which methods unauthenticated clients could call, allowing remote invocation of internal functions. Affected versions are all Salt releases before 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000.x before 3000.2. When the master is reachable (default TCP ports 4505 publisher and 4506 request server), attackers can call _prep_auth_info to obtain the master\u2019s root key and _send_pub to publish commands to minions, enabling remote, unauthenticated administrative control of the master and command execution on minions. Fixes were released April 29, 2020; the issue has been widely exploited and is listed by CISA. Sources: NVD, WithSecure advisory, Salt Project, Wiz.",
