    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a flaw in PHP\u2019s CGI SAPI (php-cgi) where specially crafted HTTP query strings (either lacking a literal '=' or using URL-encoded '%3D' without '=') can be misinterpreted as php-cgi command-line options. This enables attackers to toggle interpreter behavior and achieve remote code execution, source disclosure, or denial of service. The initial fixes in PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 were incomplete (CVE-2012-2311, CVE-2012-2336); the issue is fully addressed in PHP 5.3.13 and 5.4.3. The vulnerability is specific to the CGI SAPI path and does not affect mod_php or PHP-FPM deployments.",
