----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2012-1823 is a flaw in PHP’s CGI SAPI (php-cgi) where specially crafted HTTP query strings (either lacking a literal '=' or using URL-encoded '%3D' without '=') can be misinterpreted as php-cgi command-line options. This enables attackers to toggle interpreter behavior and achieve remote code execution, source disclosure, or denial of service. The initial fixes in PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 were incomplete (CVE-2012-2311, CVE-2012-2336); the issue is fully addressed in PHP 5.3.13 and 5.4.3. The vulnerability is specific to the CGI SAPI path and does not affect mod_php or PHP-FPM deployments.
Attack Type: Remote code execution; Information disclosure; Denial of service
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.0.0–5.3.12', '5.4.0–5.4.2']] PHP CGI SAPI (php-cgi). This is the vulnerable component when PHP runs as classic CGI. Use a vulnerable php-cgi (e.g., 5.3.12 or 5.4.2) inside the container. The official 'php' image (CLI variant) includes php-cgi; avoid FPM and mod_php to keep the CGI code path exposed.
- [SOFT][httpd][['2.4.62']] Apache HTTP Server with CGI enabled (mod_cgi or mod_cgid) to invoke the local php-cgi for .php files. Provides the required CGI execution path; not itself vulnerable. Use the official 'httpd' image and map .php to php-cgi.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
