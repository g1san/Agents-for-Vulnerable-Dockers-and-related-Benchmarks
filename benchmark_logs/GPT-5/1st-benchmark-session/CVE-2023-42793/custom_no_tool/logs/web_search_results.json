    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity Server (the on\u2011premises product; TeamCity Cloud is not affected). It allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication on vulnerable servers and then gain full administrative control, culminating in arbitrary command execution on the TeamCity host. The flaw stems from how TeamCity\u2019s request handling and authorization pre\u2011processing was configured for certain URL patterns. A logic mistake in the global request interceptors excluded specific paths from normal authorization checks. An attacker could leverage this exemption in combination with a token\u2011management capability to create a valid authentication token for an existing high\u2011privilege account without knowing any credentials. With such a token, the attacker obtains full administrative access to the web application. From there, multiple built\u2011in administrative features can be abused to execute system commands or load arbitrary code (for example, by triggering server\u2011side process execution or by leveraging administrative interfaces). No prior knowledge of credentials or user interaction is required; only network access to the TeamCity web interface is needed. The impact is severe: immediate full compromise of the TeamCity server, the ability to create new administrator accounts or tokens, deploy backdoors or malicious plugins, pivot to connected build agents and source code, and persist even after a naive upgrade if post\u2011exploitation artifacts are not removed. The issue was discovered by researchers at Sonar in early September 2023 and fixed by JetBrains on September 21, 2023, in TeamCity version 2023.05.4 (and via a security patch plugin for earlier releases). Public exploitation was reported in early October 2023, including activity attributed in reporting to state\u2011sponsored threat groups, and the vulnerability was added to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. Recommended mitigations include upgrading to 2023.05.4 or later (or applying the official security patch plugin where applicable), restricting external exposure of the TeamCity web interface, rotating credentials and tokens (and reviewing for anomalous tokens), and following vendor and threat\u2011intelligence guidance for incident investigation and hardening.",
