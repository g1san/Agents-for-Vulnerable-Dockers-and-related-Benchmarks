    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) is a critical flaw in Apache Log4j 2\u2019s log4j-core that abuses message lookup substitution and JNDI. When attacker-controlled data is logged, Log4j can resolve a JNDI reference (e.g., LDAP/RMI) to an attacker service and load data that the JVM treats as executable, enabling remote code execution. Affects log4j-core 2.0-beta9 through 2.14.1; later releases disabled/removed lookups and JNDI by default.",
