----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) is a critical flaw in Apache Log4j 2’s log4j-core that abuses message lookup substitution and JNDI. When attacker-controlled data is logged, Log4j can resolve a JNDI reference (e.g., LDAP/RMI) to an attacker service and load data that the JVM treats as executable, enabling remote code execution. Affects log4j-core 2.0-beta9 through 2.14.1; later releases disabled/removed lookups and JNDI by default.
Attack Type: Remote code execution (RCE); information disclosure; denial of service (DoS)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][solr][['7.4.0-7.7.3', '8.0.0-8.11.0']] Single-node Apache Solr bundles vulnerable log4j-core in these releases and runs standalone (HTTP out of the box) without ZooKeeper; no additional services are required to test CVE-2021-44228. Note: some images were later rebuilt with mitigations; the upstream releases listed were vulnerable at release time (log4j-core 2.0-beta9–2.14.1).
