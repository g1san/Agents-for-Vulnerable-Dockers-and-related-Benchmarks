    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin\u2019s table search-and-replace feature. phpMyAdmin built a regex from user input and passed it to PHP\u2019s preg_replace using a delimiter that could appear in user-controlled input; an attacker could inject the \u201ce\u201d modifier to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected PHP versions. Affected phpMyAdmin branches are 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 (including pre-release 4.6.0 alpha1/rc1/rc2). PHP 7+ removes code execution via preg_replace, and fixes were released in 4.0.10.16/4.4.15.7/4.6.3.",
