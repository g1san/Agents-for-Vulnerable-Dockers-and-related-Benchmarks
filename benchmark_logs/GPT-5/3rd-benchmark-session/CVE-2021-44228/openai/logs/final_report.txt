CVE description: CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2’s log4j-core that became public on 2021-12-10. It allows attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in logged data to resolve and potentially load remote classes, enabling code execution within affected Java applications. Exposure occurs when an application includes vulnerable log4j-core, logs attacker-influenced input, and JNDI/message lookups are available. Affected versions are Log4j 2.0-beta9 through 2.14.1 (log4j-core; log4j-api alone is not sufficient). Remediation progressed via Log4j 2.15.0, 2.16.0 (removing message lookups, disabling JNDI by default), and further hardening in 2.17.x and LTS baselines. The issue’s ubiquity and low exploitation complexity caused widespread impact across internet-facing and backend systems.
Attack Type: RCE
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][Java application including log4j-core][['log4j-core affected: 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1']] Essential component that becomes vulnerable when bundling affected log4j-core and logging attacker-controlled input; applicable to microservices, web apps, or any Java process.
- [SOFT][Java Runtime Environment / Java Development Kit][['Any compatible JRE/JDK']] Provides the JVM to run the application; changing only the Java version does not resolve CVE-2021-44228 without updating Log4j 2.
- [SOFT][Web or application server (if used)][['Varies']] Acts as the network front end for servlet-based deployments; not required for susceptibility, as headless/services can also be exposed if they log attacker-controlled input.
- [SOFT][Databases / message queues / caches (if used)][['Varies']] Supporting infrastructure for application logic; neither required to create nor to eliminate the Log4Shell condition.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
