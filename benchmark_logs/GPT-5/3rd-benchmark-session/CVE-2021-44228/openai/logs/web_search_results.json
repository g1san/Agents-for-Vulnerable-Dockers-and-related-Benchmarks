    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2\u2019s log4j-core that became public on 2021-12-10. It allows attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in logged data to resolve and potentially load remote classes, enabling code execution within affected Java applications. Exposure occurs when an application includes vulnerable log4j-core, logs attacker-influenced input, and JNDI/message lookups are available. Affected versions are Log4j 2.0-beta9 through 2.14.1 (log4j-core; log4j-api alone is not sufficient). Remediation progressed via Log4j 2.15.0, 2.16.0 (removing message lookups, disabling JNDI by default), and further hardening in 2.17.x and LTS baselines. The issue\u2019s ubiquity and low exploitation complexity caused widespread impact across internet-facing and backend systems.",
