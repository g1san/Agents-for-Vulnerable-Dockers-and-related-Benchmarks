CVE description: CVE-2021-44228, widely known as “Log4Shell,” is a critical flaw in the Apache Log4j 2 logging framework’s core component. The vulnerability arises from Log4j 2’s message lookups feature combined with Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) resolution. When an application using vulnerable log4j-core logs data that an attacker can influence, a specially crafted pattern such as ${jndi:ldap://...} or via other JNDI-supported protocols can trigger outbound lookups. Vulnerable Log4j versions do not adequately restrict or sanitize these lookups, allowing the library to contact attacker-controlled endpoints and potentially load and execute remote Java bytecode. This can occur in configuration, log messages, or parameters where lookups are processed. The issue affects log4j-core (not log4net/log4cxx). It is remotely exploitable, typically without authentication, and has been broadly weaponized, often via HTTP headers or other user-controlled fields that get logged by Java applications. Mitigations in later releases disable or remove JNDI lookups by default. Any Java application that includes a vulnerable log4j-core and logs attacker-controlled input is at risk.

- [HARD][log4j-core][['2.0-beta9', '2.0-rc1', '2.0-rc2', '2.0', '2.0.1', '2.0.2', '2.1', '2.2', '2.3', '2.4', '2.4.1', '2.5', '2.6', '2.6.1', '2.6.2', '2.7', '2.8', '2.8.1', '2.8.2', '2.9', '2.9.1', '2.10.0', '2.11.0', '2.11.1', '2.11.2', '2.12.0', '2.12.1', '2.13.0', '2.13.1', '2.13.2', '2.13.3', '2.14.0', '2.14.1', '2.15.0']] The vulnerable logging library that enables JNDI message lookups leading to remote code execution when attacker-controlled data is logged. These specific versions reflect the affected set cited by authoritative sources for CVE-2021-44228 (log4j-core only).
- [SOFT-WEB][tomcat][['9.0-jre11-temurin']] Java web container to run a Java web application that includes vulnerable log4j-core and exposes an HTTP interface that logs user-controlled input. Any compatible Java container/runtime would suffice; this provides the minimal web runtime in a single service.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
