    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228, widely known as \u201cLog4Shell,\u201d is a critical flaw in the Apache Log4j 2 logging framework\u2019s core component. The vulnerability arises from Log4j 2\u2019s message lookups feature combined with Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) resolution. When an application using vulnerable log4j-core logs data that an attacker can influence, a specially crafted pattern such as ${jndi:ldap://...} or via other JNDI-supported protocols can trigger outbound lookups. Vulnerable Log4j versions do not adequately restrict or sanitize these lookups, allowing the library to contact attacker-controlled endpoints and potentially load and execute remote Java bytecode. This can occur in configuration, log messages, or parameters where lookups are processed. The issue affects log4j-core (not log4net/log4cxx). It is remotely exploitable, typically without authentication, and has been broadly weaponized, often via HTTP headers or other user-controlled fields that get logged by Java applications. Mitigations in later releases disable or remove JNDI lookups by default. Any Java application that includes a vulnerable log4j-core and logs attacker-controlled input is at risk.",
