    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB where insecure default packaging/configuration allowed a fresh install to expose Erlang distribution services remotely, enabling an unauthenticated attacker to authenticate with a default/predictable Erlang cookie and gain full admin control, resulting in remote command execution. Root cause: insecure default initialization (CWE-1188) involving epmd on TCP 4369 advertising a random distribution port bound to all interfaces and the use of a default Erlang cookie. Affected versions: CouchDB prior to 3.2.2. Fixed in 3.2.2+ by refusing to start with the default cookie and binding epmd/distribution ports to localhost. CVSS v3.1: 9.8.",
