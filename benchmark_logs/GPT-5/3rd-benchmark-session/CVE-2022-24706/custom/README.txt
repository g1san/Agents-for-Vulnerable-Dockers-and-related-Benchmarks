This setup runs Apache CouchDB 3.2.1 and automatically seeds a test database.

How to run:
- docker compose up -d
- Service: http://127.0.0.1:5984 (admin/admin)

Notes:
- Healthcheck probes /_up until CouchDB is ready.
- Seeding is performed by an os_daemon process that creates a database named "testdb" and a sample document.
- A custom image is built on top of couchdb:3.2.1 to include curl (required by healthcheck and seeding).
