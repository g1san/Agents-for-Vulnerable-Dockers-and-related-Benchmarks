    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is an information disclosure flaw in the Eclipse Jetty web server and Servlet container that stems from improper handling of encoded and ambiguous path segments during Uniform Resource Identifier processing. In affected releases, Jetty\u2019s default, standards-compliant request path processing performed normalization before decoding. Combined with PathResource alias handling, this allowed crafted requests containing percent-encoded dot segments or null-like segments to bypass the usual protections around the WEB-INF directory that should never be directly web-accessible. As a result, an unauthenticated remote user can submit an HTTP request such as GET /%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml or GET /.%00/WEB-INF/web.xml (and similar variants like /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml) to trick Jetty into resolving and serving resources under WEB-INF, including web.xml and other sensitive configuration files. The vulnerability is network exploitable, requires no authentication, and exists in default compliance mode. The Jetty maintainers describe broader affected ranges for the jetty-webapp component as 9.4.37 through 9.4.42, 10.0.1 through 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 through 11.0.5. The fix, released in 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6, changes the processing order to decode before normalization, rejects ambiguous segments (such as encoded dot segments and null-like segments), prevents double-decoding issues, and tightens alias checks so that protected locations like WEB-INF cannot be exposed through encoding tricks. Reliable public sources also note that for the commonly deployed 9.4.x line, the specifically confirmed vulnerable builds include 9.4.37.v20210219 and 9.4.38.v20210224. Successful exploitation discloses the contents of files intended to be private to the web application, which can reveal configuration, credentials, or implementation details that may assist further attacks. Workarounds include implementing rewrite rules or request filtering to reject raw requests containing encoded dot or null segments before they reach Jetty\u2019s normal processing, but the recommended remediation is to upgrade to a fixed Jetty release.",

The vulnerability resides in Jetty\u2019s URI normalization/decoding and PathResource alias handling.
