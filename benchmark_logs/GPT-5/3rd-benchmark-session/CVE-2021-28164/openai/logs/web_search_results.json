    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is a path traversal flaw in Eclipse Jetty introduced in 9.4.37.v20210219 and present in 9.4.38.v20210224, fixed in 9.4.39.v20210325. In Jetty\u2019s default HttpCompliance mode after changes to RFC3986 decoding, authorization checks were performed before full URI normalization/canonicalization. Percent-encoded dot segments (%2e, %2e%2e) could bypass protections that normally block access to WEB-INF and META-INF, enabling retrieval of sensitive files (e.g., WEB-INF/web.xml). This results in unauthorized information disclosure via normal HTTP requests without authentication or user interaction. Impact is primarily to confidentiality; integrity and availability are unaffected. Mitigation includes upgrading to 9.4.39+ or enabling stricter compliance (RFC7230_NO_AMBIGUOUS_URIS). To reproduce in Docker, only Jetty is required; deploy any basic Servlet webapp with a WEB-INF directory under an affected Jetty image and use default settings.",
