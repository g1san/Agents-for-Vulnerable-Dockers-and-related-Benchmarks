    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 affects Eclipse Jetty when running in its default compliance mode and stems from improper normalization of Uniform Resource Identifiers that contain percent-encoded dot segments such as %2e and %2e%2e. Jetty\u2019s HTTP server and web container are expected to canonicalize and enforce path rules so that protected areas like the WEB-INF directory remain inaccessible over HTTP. However, in the vulnerable versions Jetty incorrectly resolves paths containing these percent-encoded segments, allowing an attacker to traverse paths and bypass the intended protections. As a result, carefully crafted requests like /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml, /%2e%2e/WEB-INF/, or related variants can be used to retrieve sensitive resources that should never be directly served, including application configuration (for example, web.xml), deployment descriptors, or other files placed under WEB-INF. Because WEB-INF often holds security constraints, servlet mappings, filter configurations, and sometimes additional metadata or bundled resources, exposure can lead to unintended disclosure of security-relevant details and may facilitate follow-on attacks. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by any party with HTTP access to the Jetty instance; no authentication, special headers, or auxiliary services are required. Impact is focused on information disclosure due to path traversal; it does not inherently execute code or modify server state. The issue specifically affects Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37.v20210219 and 9.4.38.v20210224, and is addressed in subsequent releases where normalization of percent-encoded dot segments correctly prevents traversal into protected locations. To build a minimal, testable environment that is actually vulnerable, a single Jetty container running one of the affected versions with its default configuration is sufficient, because the flaw resides in the core HTTP handling and default compliance behavior. No external database, cache, message queue, or additional web front end is required to trigger the issue.",
