    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty\u2019s server-side request/URI handling where normalization occurs before decoding. Certain encoded characters (e.g., encoded dot segments and nulls) can cause Jetty to interpret URIs differently between normalization and resource mapping, bypassing security constraints and exposing protected paths (e.g., WEB-INF). Affected versions: Jetty 9.4.37\u20139.4.42, 10.0.1\u201310.0.5, and 11.0.1\u201311.0.5; fixed in 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6. Impact: unauthenticated information disclosure/authorization bypass (confidentiality impact). CWE-200 and CWE-551. CVSS v3.1 base ~5.3.",
