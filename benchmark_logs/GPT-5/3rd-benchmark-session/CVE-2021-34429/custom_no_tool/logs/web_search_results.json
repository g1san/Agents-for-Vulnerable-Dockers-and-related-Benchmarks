    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server and servlet container that allows an unauthenticated network attacker to access normally protected resources under the WEB-INF directory by abusing Jetty\u2019s Uniform Resource Identifier processing and normalization. The issue affects Jetty\u2019s web application handling (org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp) in versions 9.4.37 through 9.4.42, 10.0.1 through 10.0.5, and 11.0.1 through 11.0.5. In default compliance mode, Jetty performed normalization of the request path before decoding, and it relaxed alias checks for PathResource. This created an authorization-before-canonicalization flaw. As a result, crafted request paths containing encoded dot or null characters (for example, a Unicode-encoded dot %u002e or an encoded null .%00) could bypass protections and alias checks intended to prevent direct access to WEB-INF. A straightforward example is an HTTP GET to /%u002e/WEB-INF/web.xml, which can return the contents of a web.xml file with an HTTP 200 response on vulnerable versions. The vulnerability is reachable with only network access to a Jetty instance; no authentication, user interaction, or auxiliary services are required. Impact is primarily the disclosure of sensitive configuration or resources and the bypass of configured security constraints, with low confidentiality impact and no direct integrity or availability impact as assessed by multiple advisories. The flaw is a variant of an earlier path handling issue (CVE-2021-28164). Jetty fixed the problem by restoring a decode-then-normalize order, rejecting ambiguous segments, preventing double-decoding, and enforcing alias checks. Patched versions are 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6 and later.",
