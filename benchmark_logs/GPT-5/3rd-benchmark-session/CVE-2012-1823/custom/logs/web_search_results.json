    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a flaw in the way PHP\u2019s Common Gateway Interface Server Application Programming Interface (php-cgi) parses query strings that do not contain an equal sign. When PHP is deployed as a Common Gateway Interface application, the php-cgi binary can mistakenly treat parts of the request query string as command-line switches. Because the command-line parser path for handling the configuration option injection (notably the \u201c-d\u201d switch, which sets php.ini directives at runtime) was not properly skipped for such requests, a remote client could supply crafted query strings that the CGI runtime would interpret as options. This allows the attacker to override security-related configuration settings (for example, enabling dangerous functions or altering include paths) and, in typical real-world configurations, reach code paths that lead to execution of arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the web server process. The vulnerability is specific to the CGI SAPI and does not affect other PHP SAPIs such as the Apache module or FastCGI Process Manager in their default, correct configurations. Impact commonly includes full compromise of the application runtime, disclosure of sensitive data, and further system penetration when the web server user has elevated access. Fixes were released in PHP 5.3.12 and 5.4.2, with additional hardening around argument parsing and query-string handling for CGI mode.",
