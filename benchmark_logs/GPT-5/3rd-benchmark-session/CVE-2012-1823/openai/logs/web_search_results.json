{
    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a command/argument injection flaw in PHP\u2019s CGI SAPI (php-cgi). When PHP runs as CGI behind a web server, specially crafted query strings without an equals sign are misinterpreted as command-line options (e.g., -d), allowing remote attackers to influence php-cgi behavior and achieve code execution. The root cause is improper option parsing in sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c (not skipping option parsing on QUERY_STRING without '='), notably via the -d path. Only CGI deployments are affected; mod_php and php-fpm are not. Initial fixes in 5.3.12/5.4.2 were incomplete, with follow-on hardening; CVSS v3.1 is 9.8 (critical).",
