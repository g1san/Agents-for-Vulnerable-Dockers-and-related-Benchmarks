CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt “salt-master” service related to improper path sanitization within the ClearFuncs class. ClearFuncs exposes methods that service authenticated requests from connected clients (for example, authenticated minions or authenticated users interacting via Salt’s client interfaces). Due to insufficient validation of user-supplied paths, these methods allow directory traversal sequences (such as "../") to escape intended directories on the master. As a result, an authenticated party can craft requests that cause the salt-master to read from or write to arbitrary paths on the master filesystem that are accessible to the salt-master process. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files (such as configuration files, keys, or tokens), exfiltration of data, manipulation or replacement of files, and potential elevation of impact if an attacker is able to overwrite files used in execution paths. The vulnerability specifically affects Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and the 3000 release series prior to 3000.2. Exploitation requires authenticated access to the salt-master’s ClearFuncs methods; it is not exploitable by a completely unauthenticated network entity. Nevertheless, in environments where minion authentication or user credentials are compromised or weakly controlled, the vulnerability materially reduces the security boundary of the master, enabling significant file system access and potential chaining to more severe outcomes.
Attack Type: Directory traversal leading to arbitrary file read and write (information disclosure and potential remote code execution if combined with file overwrite or configuration manipulation)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][saltstack/salt][['2019.2.0', '2019.2.1', '2019.2.2', '2019.2.3', '3000', '3000.1']] Salt master service (salt-master daemon). These specific versions are vulnerable to the ClearFuncs path traversal described in CVE-2020-11652. This single service is sufficient to create a working and testable system that is vulnerable; no additional services are required for the vulnerability to exist.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Main process is running (salt-master started, ports 4505/4506 bound) but the container healthcheck is failing and Health status is stuck at "starting" because the health test tries to run 'bash', which is not present in the image ("exec: 'bash': executable file not found in $PATH").
	- ERROR: The container healthcheck fails because it tries to execute `bash`, which is not present in the saltstack/salt:2019.2.3 image. As a result, Docker reports: "exec: 'bash': executable file not found in $PATH", keeping the health status stuck at "starting".
	- FIX: Replace the healthcheck command to avoid relying on bash or external networking utilities that may not exist in the base image. Use Python (present in the Salt image) to attempt TCP connections to ports 4505 and 4506. The healthcheck exits 0 only when both ports are accepting connections, which accurately reflects the service readiness.
