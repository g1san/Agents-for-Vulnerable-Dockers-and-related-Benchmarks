    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability in the SaltStack Salt \u201csalt-master\u201d service related to improper path sanitization within the ClearFuncs class. ClearFuncs exposes methods that service authenticated requests from connected clients (for example, authenticated minions or authenticated users interacting via Salt\u2019s client interfaces). Due to insufficient validation of user-supplied paths, these methods allow directory traversal sequences (such as \"../\") to escape intended directories on the master. As a result, an authenticated party can craft requests that cause the salt-master to read from or write to arbitrary paths on the master filesystem that are accessible to the salt-master process. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files (such as configuration files, keys, or tokens), exfiltration of data, manipulation or replacement of files, and potential elevation of impact if an attacker is able to overwrite files used in execution paths. The vulnerability specifically affects Salt versions prior to 2019.2.4 and the 3000 release series prior to 3000.2. Exploitation requires authenticated access to the salt-master\u2019s ClearFuncs methods; it is not exploitable by a completely unauthenticated network entity. Nevertheless, in environments where minion authentication or user credentials are compromised or weakly controlled, the vulnerability materially reduces the security boundary of the master, enabling significant file system access and potential chaining to more severe outcomes.",
