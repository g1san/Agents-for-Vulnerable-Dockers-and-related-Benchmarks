CVE description: CVE-2020-11652 is a path traversal vulnerability in Salt (SaltStack) on the master side, within salt-master’s ClearFuncs/wheel file path handling. Improper sanitization of attacker-controlled paths allows traversal (e.g., ../) to access arbitrary directories on the Salt master. Impact is primarily unauthorized file read and, in some paths, file write on the master. The flaw is reachable over the master’s native ZeroMQ interfaces (TCP 4506 request server, TCP 4505 publisher) and does not require salt-api or any minions. Exploitation in isolation assumes an authenticated context; many intrusions paired it with CVE-2020-11651 for unauthenticated compromise. Affected Salt releases: 2019.2.0, 2019.2.1, 2019.2.2, 2019.2.3; 3000 (3000.0), 3000.1. Fixed in 2019.2.4 and 3000.2. Classified as CWE-22 and listed in CISA KEV.
Attack Type: Directory traversal enabling arbitrary file read and, in some code paths, arbitrary file write on the Salt master; requires an authenticated context when exploited without CVE-2020-11651.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ubuntu][['18.04']] Container running the Salt master process. Install salt-master at a vulnerable version inside this image and expose TCP 4505/4506. Vulnerable Salt versions to install: 2019.2.0, 2019.2.1, 2019.2.2, 2019.2.3; 3000 (3000.0), 3000.1. Do not use 2019.2.4 or 3000.2+ as they contain the fix. The vulnerability resides in Salt’s master-side ClearFuncs/wheel path handling; no minion or salt-api service is required.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
