{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a path traversal vulnerability in Salt (SaltStack) on the master side, within salt-master\u2019s ClearFuncs/wheel file path handling. Improper sanitization of attacker-controlled paths allows traversal (e.g., ../) to access arbitrary directories on the Salt master. Impact is primarily unauthorized file read and, in some paths, file write on the master. The flaw is reachable over the master\u2019s native ZeroMQ interfaces (TCP 4506 request server, TCP 4505 publisher) and does not require salt-api or any minions. Exploitation in isolation assumes an authenticated context; many intrusions paired it with CVE-2020-11651 for unauthenticated compromise. Affected Salt releases: 2019.2.0, 2019.2.1, 2019.2.2, 2019.2.3; 3000 (3000.0), 3000.1. Fixed in 2019.2.4 and 3000.2. Classified as CWE-22 and listed in CISA KEV.",
