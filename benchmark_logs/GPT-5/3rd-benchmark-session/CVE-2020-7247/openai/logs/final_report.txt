CVE description: OpenSMTPD’s smtp_mailaddr function in smtp_session.c improperly validates input in the SMTP envelope parsing of the MAIL FROM address. Crafted MAIL FROM values containing shell metacharacters can be interpreted and executed with root privileges. The flaw stems from an incorrect return-path after a validation failure, allowing dangerous input to proceed. It is reachable remotely in the default configuration that listens on all interfaces and locally in loopback‑only defaults. Affected upstream family is OpenSMTPD 6.6 (portable), with practical vulnerable releases being 6.6.0p1, 6.6.1, 6.6.1p1, and 6.6.2; the issue was fixed in 6.6.2p1.
Attack Type: Unauthenticated remote operating-system command execution via SMTP MAIL FROM input, resulting in execution of attacker-supplied commands with root privileges.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [SOFT][debian][['10-slim']] Minimal Linux base image used to build and run OpenSMTPD 6.6.x; provides glibc and tooling. Expose TCP port 25 for SMTP. Suitable for compiling and installing the specified vulnerable OpenSMTPD versions.
- [HARD][OpenSMTPD][['6.6.0p1', '6.6.1', '6.6.1p1', '6.6.2']] Mail transfer agent containing the vulnerable smtp_mailaddr parsing logic. Required for the system to be susceptible to CVE-2020-7247. Upstream fixed version boundary is 6.6.2p1 (use only for patched/control builds).

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: apt-get update fails on debian:10-slim because Debian Buster repositories have been moved to the archive. The default sources in the base image point to deb.debian.org and security.debian.org, which now return 404 and lack Release files for buster. This aborts the build at the dependency installation step.
	- FIX: Switch APT sources to archive.debian.org for both main and security repositories and disable the Valid-Until check so archived Release files are accepted. Additionally, install the openssl (and ssl-cert) packages to ensure the entrypoint’s TLS certificate generation works reliably at runtime.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: During the image build, the step that compiles OpenSMTPD fails with '/bin/sh: 1: ./configure: not found'. The tarball fetched from opensmtpd.org no longer provides a pre-generated 'configure' script for the version being used (6.6.2), so attempting to run './configure' directly fails.
	- FIX: Fetch the portable OpenSMTPD 6.6.2 source from the OpenSMTPD-portable GitHub repository and generate the 'configure' script using the project's bootstrap process before configuring and compiling. To do so, switch the source URL to GitHub 'OpenSMTPD-portable' tag 'opensmtpd-6.6.2', install the required autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool, m4), and run './bootstrap' followed by './configure' and 'make install'. This preserves the vulnerable version while ensuring a successful build.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The image build fails when fetching the OpenSMTPD source: curl returns HTTP 404 because the requested GitHub tag URL uses the non-existent prefix 'opensmtpd-' (opensmtpd-6.6.2). The OpenSMTPD-portable repository’s 6.6.2 tag is named '6.6.2' (without the 'opensmtpd-' prefix), so both the archive URL and the extracted directory name are wrong, causing the build to stop at step [4/9].
	- FIX: Adjust the Dockerfile to fetch the correct tag and path from GitHub. Use tag '6.6.2' directly and update the extracted directory path from 'OpenSMTPD-portable-opensmtpd-${OSMTPD_VER}' to 'OpenSMTPD-portable-${OSMTPD_VER}'. This resolves the 404 and allows the build and installation to proceed. No other service changes are required.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: During the image build, the step that downloads the OpenSMTPD portable source fails with a 404 when requesting https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD-portable/archive/refs/tags/6.6.2.tar.gz. The tag layout in the portable repository does not provide a tarball at that path. As a result, the curl command exits with code 22 and the build stops.
	- FIX: Fetch the OpenSMTPD-portable source via git using a known tag name format for the portable repo (v6.6.2) instead of downloading a non-existent tarball. Install git in the build image, clone the repository, checkout the v6.6.2 tag, then bootstrap, configure, build, and install. Additionally, remove the obsolete version key from docker-compose.yml to avoid the deprecation warning. No other service changes are required.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: During image build, the step cloning OpenSMTPD-portable via git fails with: "fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address". This typically occurs when git prompts for credentials (e.g., due to rate limiting or restricted network), which is not possible in non-interactive Docker builds. As a result, the build aborts at the git clone step.
	- FIX: Avoid using git during the Docker build and instead download the public source tarball for the required tag directly from GitHub via HTTPS using curl. Extract the tarball, then run the bootstrap/configure/make/install steps as before. This removes reliance on interactive git authentication and ensures deterministic builds. Implemented by replacing the git clone/checkout sequence with curl -L https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD-portable/archive/refs/tags/${OSMTPD_TAG}.tar.gz and extracting to the known directory OpenSMTPD-portable-${OSMTPD_TAG} (tag includes the leading 'v'). No other service changes are needed.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: During the build, the step that downloads the OpenSMTPD source retrieves a 9‑byte file from the GitHub tag URL refs/tags/v6.6.2.tar.gz, which is not a valid gzip archive. The subsequent tar -xzf fails with "gzip: stdin: not in gzip format". This indicates the referenced GitHub tag/tarball does not exist in that location or redirects to a non-archive response, causing the build to abort.
	- FIX: Download a known-good portable release archive from the official OpenSMTPD archives instead of the GitHub tag tarball. Use https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.6.2.tar.gz, extract into the opensmtpd-6.6.2 directory, and build via ./configure && make && make install. Remove the bootstrap invocation, which is unnecessary for release tarballs that already contain the configure script. Keep the vulnerable 6.6.2 version as required by the scenario.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: During build, the step that compiles OpenSMTPD fails with: '/bin/sh: 1: ./configure: not found'. The tarball fetched from https://www.opensmtpd.org/archives/opensmtpd-6.6.2.tar.gz extracts to opensmtpd-6.6.2 but does not include a portable 'configure' script. This archive is not the portable release expected by the build instructions, so the configure step cannot run and the image build terminates with exit code 127.
	- FIX: Switch to a known vulnerable portable release archive that includes the generated 'configure' script. Use OpenSMTPD version 6.6.1p1 from the official archives, which is within the specified vulnerable range. Update the OSMTPD_VER and OSMTPD_URL accordingly while keeping the rest of the build steps (configure/make/install) unchanged.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: During the OpenSMTPD build step, the configure script fails with: "configure: error: *** asr.h missing - please install first or check config.log ***". This indicates the portable build requires libasr headers, which are not present in the image. On Debian Buster, these are provided by the libasr-dev package (headers) and libasr0 (runtime library).
	- FIX: Install libasr-dev as a build dependency and include libasr0 as a runtime dependency in the Dockerfile's apt-get install list. This provides asr.h for configure/compile and the shared library for runtime. No other service changes are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: The OpenSMTPD build fails because the build system invokes yacc via ylwrap to regenerate parse.c from parse.y, but no yacc-compatible parser generator is installed in the image. The log shows: "../../ylwrap: line 175: yacc: command not found" leading to make error 127.
	- FIX: Install a yacc implementation as a build dependency. On Debian, the 'bison' package provides a yacc-compatible binary. Adding 'bison' (and optionally 'flex' which is commonly paired, though not strictly required here) to the apt-get install list resolves the error. No other changes are necessary.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
