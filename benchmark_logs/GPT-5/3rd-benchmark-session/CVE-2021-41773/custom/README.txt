How to run:
- From this directory, run: docker compose up --build -d
- Access http://localhost/ to see the default page
- Access http://localhost/uploads/public.txt to see the aliased directory content
- Access http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.sh to verify CGI execution

This environment runs Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 with an Alias outside DocumentRoot and CGI enabled, making it suitable to test CVE-2021-41773 behaviors.
