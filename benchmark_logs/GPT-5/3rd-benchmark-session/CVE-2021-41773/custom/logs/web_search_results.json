    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server arising from flawed path normalization in the core request handling. Specifically, the ap_normalize_path routine incorrectly decodes certain percent-encoded sequences involved in directory traversal, such that patterns like \".%2e/\" can partially bypass the canonicalization that is supposed to collapse traversal elements. When a server is configured with Alias-like directives that map URLs to filesystem paths outside the main DocumentRoot, and those mapped locations are not protected by the default \"require all denied,\" an attacker can craft URLs that traverse out of the intended directory and read files from elsewhere on the filesystem. This yields local file disclosure, often of sensitive files such as system passwords, configuration files, or application secrets. The risk increases significantly when Common Gateway Interface execution is enabled on these aliased paths (for example via mod_cgi or mod_cgid), because the traversal can reach and invoke scripts or binaries in unintended locations, enabling remote code execution. Exploitation was observed in the wild. According to the Apache HTTP Server Project and NIST, version 2.4.49 is affected; the initial attempt to fix the issue in 2.4.50 was incomplete and tracked separately as CVE-2021-42013, with a complete fix delivered in 2.4.51 and later. Successful exploitation typically requires: a vulnerable Apache 2.4.49 instance; at least one Alias-like mapping or directory outside DocumentRoot; misconfigured access controls that grant access (for example, broad \"Require all granted\" at or above the aliased location); and, for code execution impact, CGI/script execution enabled on paths reachable via traversal. Mitigations include upgrading to 2.4.51 or later, ensuring non-aliased filesystem paths are denied by default, avoiding permissive root-level grants, restricting or disabling CGI on aliased paths, and employing web application firewall rules that detect traversal patterns associated with this flaw.",
