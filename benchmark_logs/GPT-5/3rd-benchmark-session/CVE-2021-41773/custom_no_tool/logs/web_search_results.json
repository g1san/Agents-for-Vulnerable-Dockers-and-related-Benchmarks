    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server core introduced by a change in path normalization logic. In version 2.4.49, the routine responsible for canonicalizing request paths (ap_normalize_path) incompletely validated traversal sequences. By crafting specific URL paths (for example, mixing encoded characters like .%2e/), an attacker can bypass the normalization checks and traverse outside the intended web document root or outside directories controlled by Alias-like directives. If the server\u2019s access controls are misconfigured\u2014particularly when the default authorization of \u201cRequire all denied\u201d is not in effect for the targeted filesystem locations\u2014this traversal allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the server\u2019s filesystem, leading to information disclosure such as configuration files or the source of server-side scripts. The impact can escalate if Common Gateway Interface execution is enabled in the traversed or aliased locations: the attacker may be able to reach and execute scripts, thereby turning a file disclosure issue into remote code execution under the privileges of the web server process. The issue was actively exploited in the wild. The initial attempt to fix the flaw in version 2.4.50 was incomplete and became CVE-2021-42013; the vulnerability is fully remediated in 2.4.51. Recommended mitigations include upgrading to version 2.4.51 or later, enforcing \u201cRequire all denied\u201d on non-public paths (never broadly granting at the root), and restricting or disabling Common Gateway Interface functionality where not explicitly required.",

Running this specific version is sufficient to create a working and testable environment vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773. No additional services are strictly required beyond the web server itself to demonstrate the vulnerability; further impact such as remote code execution depends on server configuration (for example, enabling Common Gateway Interface), not on separate services."
