    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a path normalization flaw in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 that allows directory traversal via crafted URIs (e.g., encoded dot-segments) to access files outside intended web content directories when not protected by default access controls. If CGI execution is enabled in traversable aliased paths, the issue can lead to remote code execution. The flaw was introduced in 2.4.49, incompletely fixed in 2.4.50 (tracked as CVE-2021-42013), and fully resolved in 2.4.51. Exploitation was observed in the wild.",
