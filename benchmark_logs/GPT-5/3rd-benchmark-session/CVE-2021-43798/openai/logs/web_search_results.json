    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Grafana\u2019s handler for serving plugin asset paths under /public/plugins/<plugin-id>/. By inserting traversal sequences into these URLs, an unauthenticated remote attacker can read arbitrary files from the underlying server that the Grafana process can access. Affects Grafana 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0; fixed in 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, and 8.3.1. Impact is high for confidentiality (arbitrary file read), with CVSS v3.1 base score 7.5; integrity and availability are not directly impacted. The issue is categorized under CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory). Exploitation has been observed; Grafana Cloud was not affected.",
