    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is an authentication-bypass flaw in the Salt master (ClearFuncs) where internal methods _prep_auth_info and _send_pub are exposed without proper validation, allowing an unauthenticated remote client to retrieve the master\u2019s root-equivalent key and publish arbitrary jobs to minions, resulting in administrative control of the master and remote command execution on minions. Affects Salt before 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000 before 3000.2. Default network context involves TCP 4506 (Request Server) and 4505 (Publisher).
