    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is a critical authentication bypass in SaltStack Salt\u2019s master component. In affected releases (Salt 2019.2.x prior to 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000.x prior to 3000.2), the salt-master exposes a ZeroMQ-based \u201cClear\u201d channel (commonly listening on TCP ports 4505 and 4506) that publishes and receives unauthenticated requests. The ClearFuncs interface on the master fails to properly validate method invocations, allowing an unauthenticated remote party with network reachability to the master\u2019s cleartext request server to invoke privileged wheel and runner functions. Through these exposed methods, an attacker can extract the master\u2019s authentication secrets (such as root keys or tokens), enumerate and control connected minions, and send publisher messages that trigger command execution across the managed infrastructure. Because the master is the central control point for Salt deployments, compromise of the master typically escalates to full remote command execution on both the master host and all connected minions. The flaw requires only network access to the master\u2019s service ports; no valid Salt credentials, no interaction with the optional Salt API service, and no auxiliary services are needed. The issue was widely exposed on the Internet at disclosure time and carried a maximum severity score, reflecting the ease of exploitation and the breadth of impact. Recommended mitigations include upgrading to fixed versions (2019.2.4 or 3000.2 and later), restricting network access so only authorized minions can reach the master\u2019s ports 4505/4506, and hardening authentication and access controls on the master.",
