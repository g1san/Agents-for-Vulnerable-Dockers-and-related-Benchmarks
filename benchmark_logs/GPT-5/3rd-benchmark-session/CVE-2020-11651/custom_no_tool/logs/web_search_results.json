    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is an authentication bypass in SaltStack Salt that affects the salt-master service. The flaw resides in the master\u2019s unauthenticated ZeroMQ \u201cclear\u201d interface (the ClearFuncs API) exposed via the request server on Transmission Control Protocol port 4506. Due to improper authorization checks on certain clear functions, a remote client with only network access to the salt-master\u2019s request port can invoke methods that should not be publicly accessible. One critical consequence is the ability to retrieve the master\u2019s root key. With that key, the attacker can authenticate as the master itself and perform privileged actions. This enables multiple high-impact outcomes: execution of arbitrary commands and jobs on the salt-master host; scheduling and executing arbitrary commands across all connected minions; and, in many proof-of-concept demonstrations, reading or writing files on the master. No prior credentials are required; exploitation hinges solely on reaching the master\u2019s request server on port 4506. The companion publisher service on port 4505 is not required for the initial bypass. According to widely cited advisories and the National Vulnerability Database, affected releases include Salt before 2019.2.4 and the 3000 series before 3000.2 (for example, 2019.2.0, 2019.2.1, 2019.2.2, 2019.2.3, 3000, and 3000.1). Upgrading to fixed versions (2019.2.4 or later and 3000.2 or later) and restricting network exposure of the master\u2019s request interface are the primary remediations. The vulnerability directly targets the salt-master service; no auxiliary databases, message queues, or web servers are necessary to be vulnerable.",
