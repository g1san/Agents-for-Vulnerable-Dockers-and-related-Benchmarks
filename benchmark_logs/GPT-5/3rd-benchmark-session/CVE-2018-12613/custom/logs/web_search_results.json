    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a severe vulnerability in phpMyAdmin affecting versions 4.8.x before 4.8.2 (specifically 4.8.0 and 4.8.1). The flaw lies in an improper whitelist check in the internal page redirection and loading logic. Due to insufficient validation of what pages may be redirected to or loaded internally, phpMyAdmin can be tricked into including files from the server\u2019s filesystem. In practice, this results in a server-side file inclusion condition that allows an attacker to view sensitive local files and, depending on the context of the included file and server configuration, to execute arbitrary code on the server. Typically, exploitation requires an authenticated, low-privileged user because the vulnerable code path is commonly reached after login. However, two configuration directives can remove normal barriers: if $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] is set to true, an attacker can direct phpMyAdmin to connect to a host under their control and leverage the inclusion flaw to execute arbitrary code; if $cfg['ServerDefault'] is set to 0, phpMyAdmin\u2019s login requirement can be bypassed and the vulnerable code path can be reached without authentication. The issue was fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.8.2 and later. Recommended mitigations include upgrading to a fixed version, avoiding enabling the risky directives noted above, and using restrictive PHP configurations such as open_basedir to limit file inclusion impact. Security sources including the phpMyAdmin advisory (PMASA-2018-4), SUSE, and NVD confirm the scope: phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 are affected; exploitation is through the web interface; impact ranges from local file disclosure to full arbitrary code execution depending on environment and configuration.",
