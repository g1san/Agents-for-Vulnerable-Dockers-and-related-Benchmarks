CVE description: CVE-2018-12613 affects phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2 (specifically 4.8.0 and 4.8.1). The issue stems from a flawed internal page routing mechanism where a whitelist check was implemented incorrectly, allowing certain redirected pages to include files outside intended paths. As a result, an authenticated user can include and read local files and, in realistic environments, may achieve server-side code execution. Exploitation typically requires authentication, but specific configurations can reduce or remove this requirement: enabling AllowArbitraryServer ($cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true) lets an attacker point phpMyAdmin to an attacker-controlled host, and setting $cfg['ServerDefault']=0 can trigger the vulnerable path without login. Multiple vendor and distribution advisories concur on these points and recommend upgrading to 4.8.2 or newer as the fix.
Attack Type: File inclusion (LFI) with potential server-side code execution depending on configuration
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] Vulnerable component. Official phpMyAdmin Docker image (apache variant by default) includes its own web server, so no separate HTTP service is required.
- [SOFT][mariadb][['10.11']] Optional database backend to make phpMyAdmin fully operational; not the vulnerable component. One of MariaDB or MySQL is sufficient.
- [SOFT][mysql][['5.7']] Alternative optional database backend; not the vulnerable component. One of MariaDB or MySQL is sufficient.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
