    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 affects phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2 (specifically 4.8.0 and 4.8.1). The issue stems from a flawed internal page routing mechanism where a whitelist check was implemented incorrectly, allowing certain redirected pages to include files outside intended paths. As a result, an authenticated user can include and read local files and, in realistic environments, may achieve server-side code execution. Exploitation typically requires authentication, but specific configurations can reduce or remove this requirement: enabling AllowArbitraryServer ($cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true) lets an attacker point phpMyAdmin to an attacker-controlled host, and setting $cfg['ServerDefault']=0 can trigger the vulnerable path without login. Multiple vendor and distribution advisories concur on these points and recommend upgrading to 4.8.2 or newer as the fix.",
