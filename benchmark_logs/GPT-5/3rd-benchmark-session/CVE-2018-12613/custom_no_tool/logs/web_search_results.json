    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin 4.8.0\u20134.8.1 that allows an authenticated user to include arbitrary local files by abusing phpMyAdmin\u2019s page routing and filtering logic in index.php. The flaw resides in how the application validates the target parameter. In versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, phpMyAdmin reused Core::checkPageValidity for final validation, which only inspects the path segment before a question mark and uses an allowlist. By double-encoding a question mark as %253f, an attacker can bypass the intended routing and whitelist checks, then perform directory traversal to force inclusion of arbitrary files on the server. Once a local file inclusion is achieved, it often escalates to remote code execution because the included files can contain attacker-controlled PHP code. A common path to code execution is: the attacker logs into phpMyAdmin, runs an SQL query that causes phpMyAdmin to store PHP code in the user\u2019s session data, and then triggers inclusion of the session file (for example, under /var/lib/php/sessions/sess_<SESSION_ID> or platform-specific equivalents) via a crafted request such as /index.php?target=db_sql.php%253f/../../.../var/lib/php/sessions/sess_<SESSION_ID>. When the session file is included by PHP, the injected PHP executes with the web server\u2019s privileges. The vulnerability typically requires authentication because valid phpMyAdmin cookies are needed to reach the vulnerable code paths and to identify the correct session file. Certain configurations may increase exposure: enabling $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] can let an attacker point phpMyAdmin at a host they control, and setting $cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0 can bypass the login step and reach the vulnerable inclusion logic without authentication. In all cases, the core issue is insufficient validation of the target parameter combined with a routing bypass using a double-encoded question mark, enabling local file inclusion and, in practical scenarios, execution of attacker-controlled PHP code via included session or other writable files.",
