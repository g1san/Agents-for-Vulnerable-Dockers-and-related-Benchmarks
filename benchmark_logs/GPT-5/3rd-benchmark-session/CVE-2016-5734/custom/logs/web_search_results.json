    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 (PMASA-2016-27) is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin\u2019s table search-and-replace feature where input used to build a regular expression for PHP\u2019s preg_replace function was not properly sanitized. Because phpMyAdmin failed to enforce safe delimiters and filter out dangerous regex modifiers, an attacker could inject the preg_replace \u201cevaluate\u201d modifier and craft a replacement that is treated as executable PHP code. When processed by vulnerable phpMyAdmin on PHP runtimes that still support evaluation via preg_replace, the attacker-controlled input is executed server-side. The issue is intrinsic to phpMyAdmin\u2019s application logic (not the database server), but the feature resides in the authenticated web interface and interacts with MySQL or MariaDB tables. According to phpMyAdmin\u2019s advisory and NVD, affected branches are 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. Exploitation requires access to the phpMyAdmin web interface and a PHP version where preg_replace with evaluation semantics is still available; PHP 7.0 and later remove this execution path, and upgrading phpMyAdmin to fixed versions remediates the flaw. Impact is severe because successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution under the web server\u2019s privileges, enabling full application compromise, data theft or manipulation, and pivoting within the host environment.",
