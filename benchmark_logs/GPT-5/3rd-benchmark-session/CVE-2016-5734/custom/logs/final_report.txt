CVE description: CVE-2016-5734 (PMASA-2016-27) is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin’s table search-and-replace feature where input used to build a regular expression for PHP’s preg_replace function was not properly sanitized. Because phpMyAdmin failed to enforce safe delimiters and filter out dangerous regex modifiers, an attacker could inject the preg_replace “evaluate” modifier and craft a replacement that is treated as executable PHP code. When processed by vulnerable phpMyAdmin on PHP runtimes that still support evaluation via preg_replace, the attacker-controlled input is executed server-side. The issue is intrinsic to phpMyAdmin’s application logic (not the database server), but the feature resides in the authenticated web interface and interacts with MySQL or MariaDB tables. According to phpMyAdmin’s advisory and NVD, affected branches are 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. Exploitation requires access to the phpMyAdmin web interface and a PHP version where preg_replace with evaluation semantics is still available; PHP 7.0 and later remove this execution path, and upgrading phpMyAdmin to fixed versions remediates the flaw. Impact is severe because successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution under the web server’s privileges, enabling full application compromise, data theft or manipulation, and pivoting within the host environment.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin][['4.6.0', '4.6.1', '4.6.2']] Core vulnerable application exposing the regex-based search-and-replace feature that leads to code execution per CVE-2016-5734. These are explicit Docker Hub tags in the affected 4.6.x line (all vulnerable per NVD/phpMyAdmin until 4.6.3). The image bundles the necessary web server (Apache) and PHP runtime needed to exercise the vulnerable code path.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7.34']] Relational database required for phpMyAdmin to function and to back the tables against which search-and-replace operates. Any MySQL 5.6/5.7 compatible version works; 5.7.34 is a stable choice compatible with phpMyAdmin 4.6.x.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
