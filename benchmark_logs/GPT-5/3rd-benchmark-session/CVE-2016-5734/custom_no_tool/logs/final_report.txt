CVE description: CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, the popular web-based administration interface for MySQL and MariaDB. In affected phpMyAdmin versions, the application’s implementation of its table Search-and-Replace feature fails to sufficiently constrain the regular expression delimiter and the replacement evaluation behavior used with PHP’s preg_replace function. Because of this improper delimiter handling, phpMyAdmin can be coerced into invoking preg_replace with the historical “e” (evaluate) modifier on attacker-controlled input, which causes that input to be evaluated as PHP code. When an authenticated user supplies a crafted replacement string during a Search-and-Replace operation, phpMyAdmin may execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the web server process. This can lead to full compromise of the host running phpMyAdmin, exposure or modification of database contents, installation of backdoors, and lateral movement. The issue affects multiple phpMyAdmin release lines: 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. The exploitability also depends on PHP runtime behavior: older PHP versions allowed such evaluated replacements, while newer PHP versions removed or restricted this behavior. The vendor fixed the vulnerability by ensuring safe delimiter selection and removing paths that could invoke evaluation, releasing patched versions 4.0.10.16, 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.3 and later. Successful exploitation requires network access to a vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance and valid phpMyAdmin credentials (since Search-and-Replace operations require authentication). A working, testable vulnerable setup therefore consists of phpMyAdmin (with a vulnerable version) and a compatible MySQL or MariaDB server that phpMyAdmin can manage. No additional auxiliary services (such as reverse proxies or message queues) are necessary to expose the vulnerable functionality.
Attack Type: Remote code execution by an authenticated user via crafted input that triggers evaluation in a server-side regular-expression replacement
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin][['4.6.2', '4.6.1', '4.6.0', '4.4.15.6', '4.4.15.5', '4.4.15.4', '4.0.10.15', '4.0.10.14']] phpMyAdmin application containing the vulnerable Search-and-Replace code path. These specific tags represent concrete vulnerable releases from the affected lines noted by NVD/vendor (4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, 4.6.x before 4.6.3). Running one of these tags exposes the vulnerability over HTTP(S).
- [SOFT-DB][mariadb][['10.1.37']] Relational database backend required by phpMyAdmin to be functional and to exercise the Search-and-Replace feature. Any compatible MySQL or MariaDB version works; MariaDB 10.1.37 is a stable choice contemporary with the affected phpMyAdmin lines.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
