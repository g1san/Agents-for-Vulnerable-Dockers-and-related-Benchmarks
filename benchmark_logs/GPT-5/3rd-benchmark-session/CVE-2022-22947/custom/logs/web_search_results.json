    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway that results from improper handling of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) within the Spring Boot Actuator \u201cgateway\u201d management endpoints when those endpoints are enabled, exposed over HTTP, and not secured. In vulnerable releases, the Actuator Gateway API allows creating or updating route definitions (for example via POST /actuator/gateway/routes/{id}) and then activating them (for example via POST /actuator/gateway/refresh). Because route \u201cfilters\u201d and \u201cpredicates\u201d can be configured with arguments that are evaluated using SpEL, a malicious route containing crafted SpEL can be injected through these endpoints. When the route is refreshed and processed, the expression is evaluated within the Gateway process, leading to code injection and arbitrary command or code execution. This attack is typically possible when operators leave the Actuator Gateway endpoints publicly reachable and without authentication or authorization. The vulnerability affects Spring Cloud Gateway 3.1.0 and 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 (and older unsupported versions), and is fixed in 3.1.1 and 3.0.7. Mitigations include upgrading to fixed versions, disabling the gateway actuator endpoint if not needed, restricting network exposure of management endpoints, and applying Spring Security to enforce authentication and authorization on Actuator write operations. The core preconditions for exploitation are: a Spring Cloud Gateway application using a vulnerable version, with Spring Boot Actuator\u2019s gateway endpoints enabled, reachable over HTTP, and not secured with proper authentication and authorization. No external databases, message queues, or ancillary services are required for exploitation; the attack is performed entirely over HTTP to the exposed Actuator Gateway endpoints.",
