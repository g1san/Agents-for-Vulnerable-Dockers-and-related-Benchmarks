    "desc": "CVE-2022-46169 is a critical flaw in the Cacti network monitoring web application affecting all releases up to and including version 1.2.22. The vulnerability resides in the remote_agent.php endpoint, which is intended to be contacted by trusted pollers. Cacti\u2019s remote agent authorizes clients by deriving the client address via get_client_addr, which erroneously trusts attacker-controlled HTTP headers (for example, X-Forwarded-For). It then resolves that address using gethostbyaddr and compares the resulting hostname to entries in the poller table within Cacti\u2019s database. Because the code honors spoofable headers and typical installations include a default poller entry that corresponds to the server itself, an unauthenticated attacker can provide an address that resolves to a hostname present in the poller table and thereby bypass access controls without valid credentials. After this authorization bypass, the attacker can trigger the polldata action (for example, by sending a request to /remote_agent.php?action=polldata). During polldata handling, poll_for_data loads poller_item definitions from the database. If a poller_item is configured with the action POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP, Cacti uses PHP\u2019s proc_open to build and execute a command string. In affected versions, the command construction incorporates attacker-controlled input, notably the poller_id parameter obtained via get_nfilter_request_var, without sufficient sanitization. This allows command injection by embedding shell metacharacters in poller_id (for example, poller_id=\";id\"). Successful exploitation typically also requires valid host_id and local_data_id values, which can be enumerated or guessed; many deployments have at least one data source using POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP through default templates. The result is arbitrary operating system command execution in the context of the web server user, achieved without authentication. The issue has been observed exploited in the wild. Remediation is to upgrade to Cacti 1.2.23 or 1.3.0 and to harden client address handling by not trusting HTTP_* headers for authentication decisions and restricting network exposure of the Cacti web interface.",
