    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical vulnerability in Facade Ignition, the error page and debugging package commonly bundled with Laravel applications. When a Laravel application is deployed with debug mode enabled, affected versions of Ignition handle certain debug actions using insecure calls to file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(). In practice, this unsafe file input/output usage allows an attacker to craft requests that cause Ignition to write or read arbitrary files on the server in the context of the web process. Because Ignition powers the interactive error page and solution execution features during development, these file operations can be coerced into introducing attacker-controlled code into locations that the framework will subsequently execute (for example, through crafted log channels or view/template files). As a result, an unauthenticated network attacker can achieve full arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the Laravel application. The issue is exploitable without any prior authentication whenever the application is running with APP_DEBUG=true and uses vulnerable Ignition releases. According to authoritative sources, Ignition before 2.5.2 is affected. More detailed advisories note that the following Ignition release lines are vulnerable: 2.0.0 up to but not including 2.4.2, 2.5.0 up to but not including 2.5.2, 1.7.0 up to but not including 1.16.14, and any version earlier than 1.6.15. Laravel applications prior to 8.4.2 are typically susceptible when debug mode is enabled because they integrate affected Ignition versions by default. Successful exploitation yields full server-side code execution with the privileges of the web server user. Mitigations include disabling debug mode in non-development environments and upgrading Ignition to 1.6.15, 1.16.14, 2.4.2, or 2.5.2 (or later), and ensuring Laravel is updated to at least 8.4.2 or later so that safe Ignition versions are required.",
