    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a vulnerability in Ignition, the debug error page handler used by Laravel applications. When a Laravel application exposes Ignition in debug mode (APP_DEBUG=true), certain Ignition endpoints process user-controlled inputs in an unsafe way, notably by calling file_get_contents and file_put_contents on attacker-influenced paths. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to abuse PHP stream wrappers (such as php:// and phar://) and Laravel\u2019s writable log directory to perform log poisoning and ultimately trigger PHP object deserialization via PHAR handling in the Monolog logger. The common attack flow is: the attacker reaches an Ignition debug endpoint (for example, /_ignition/execute-solution) and uses a specially crafted payload to write controlled content into storage/logs/laravel.log; the attacker then references that log through a phar:// stream so that PHP treats it as a PHAR archive; when PHP processes the PHAR metadata, Monolog gadget chains are invoked, leading to execution of attacker-supplied commands on the host running the Laravel application. The vulnerable condition requires a publicly accessible Laravel application with Ignition enabled and in debug mode, writable storage/logs, and PHP stream wrapper support. According to authoritative sources, Ignition versions prior to 2.5.2 are affected, and Laravel framework versions prior to 8.4.2 are commonly impacted when paired with affected Ignition releases. Real-world attacks have included deployment of cryptocurrency miners after successful compromise. Recommended mitigations are to disable debug mode in production (APP_DEBUG=false) and update Ignition to 2.5.2 or later (and Laravel to 8.4.2 or later).",
