CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a vulnerability in Ignition, the debug error page handler used by Laravel applications. When a Laravel application exposes Ignition in debug mode (APP_DEBUG=true), certain Ignition endpoints process user-controlled inputs in an unsafe way, notably by calling file_get_contents and file_put_contents on attacker-influenced paths. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to abuse PHP stream wrappers (such as php:// and phar://) and Laravelâ€™s writable log directory to perform log poisoning and ultimately trigger PHP object deserialization via PHAR handling in the Monolog logger. The common attack flow is: the attacker reaches an Ignition debug endpoint (for example, /_ignition/execute-solution) and uses a specially crafted payload to write controlled content into storage/logs/laravel.log; the attacker then references that log through a phar:// stream so that PHP treats it as a PHAR archive; when PHP processes the PHAR metadata, Monolog gadget chains are invoked, leading to execution of attacker-supplied commands on the host running the Laravel application. The vulnerable condition requires a publicly accessible Laravel application with Ignition enabled and in debug mode, writable storage/logs, and PHP stream wrapper support. According to authoritative sources, Ignition versions prior to 2.5.2 are affected, and Laravel framework versions prior to 8.4.2 are commonly impacted when paired with affected Ignition releases. Real-world attacks have included deployment of cryptocurrency miners after successful compromise. Recommended mitigations are to disable debug mode in production (APP_DEBUG=false) and update Ignition to 2.5.2 or later (and Laravel to 8.4.2 or later).
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['7.4-apache']] Runs the Laravel application and exposes the web endpoints required for Ignition. This container provides Apache plus PHP with PHAR and stream wrapper support, which are prerequisites for the vulnerability to be exploitable. Inside this service, the application must include the vulnerable Ignition package (facade/ignition prior to 2.5.2) and be configured with APP_DEBUG=true to actually be vulnerable.
- [SOFT-WEB][composer][['2.1']] Used during image build or initialization to install the Laravel application and pin the vulnerable dependencies (for example, facade/ignition 2.5.1 and Laravel framework prior to 8.4.2). Not required at runtime once the application is installed, but needed to assemble the container with the precise vulnerable package versions.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
