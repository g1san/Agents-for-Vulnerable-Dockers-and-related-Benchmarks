    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical flaw in Laravel\u2019s Ignition debug package that allows unauthenticated remote code execution when a Laravel app is running in debug mode. The root cause is unsafe file operations (e.g., file_get_contents/file_put_contents) on attacker-controlled input within Ignition\u2019s solution execution flow, enabling abuse of PHP stream wrappers to write/load and execute code. Exploitation requires a reachable Laravel app with Ignition enabled and APP_DEBUG=true, exposing Ignition endpoints. Affected versions: Ignition < 2.5.2 and Laravel sites using debug mode with framework versions before 8.4.2. Impact is full RCE over the network (CVSS v3.1 9.8). Fixed by validation hardening (e.g., disallowing stream wrappers) in Ignition 2.5.2.",
