    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a flaw in Apache HTTP Server\u2019s core path normalization and handling of Alias-like directives that affects only versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. It is the result of an incomplete fix for the earlier CVE-2021-41773. When specially crafted, encoded path traversal sequences are used in requests, Apache can incorrectly map those requests to files outside the intended DocumentRoot when they pass through directories configured by Alias-like directives. If those external locations are not protected by strict access controls (for example, the default \u201cRequire all denied\u201d), an unauthenticated attacker can access arbitrary files on the server. Furthermore, if the deployment enables execution of Common Gateway Interface programs on the aliased paths (for example via mod_cgi or mod_cgid, using ScriptAlias or ExecCGI), the same traversal flaw can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands on the server in the context of the web server process. In other words, the vulnerability enables two impact modes depending on configuration: unrestricted file disclosure outside the web root and, when CGI execution is permitted on reachable paths, full command execution via crafted requests. Exploitation requires only network access to the vulnerable Apache HTTP Server and a misconfiguration that exposes alias-mapped directories without proper access restrictions. The issue is fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and later. Mitigations include upgrading to a fixed version, ensuring non-public paths are covered by \u201cRequire all denied,\u201d and avoiding broad or unintended enablement of CGI execution on aliased directories.",

To reproduce the remote command execution impact, the container\u2019s Apache configuration must enable CGI execution (e.g., mod_cgi or mod_cgid with ScriptAlias/ExecCGI) and expose an aliased, world-accessible directory without restrictive access controls. No additional services are required to make the environment vulnerable or functional for testing this CVE."
