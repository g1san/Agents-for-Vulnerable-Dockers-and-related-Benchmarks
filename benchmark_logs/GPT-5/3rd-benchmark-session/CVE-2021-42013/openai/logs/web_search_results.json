    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server. In 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, improper path normalization under Alias-like mappings allows directory traversal to access files outside intended directories when access controls are relaxed. If CGI (mod_cgi/mod_cgid) is enabled for those aliased locations, the traversal can be used to execute arbitrary code. Fixed in 2.4.51.",
