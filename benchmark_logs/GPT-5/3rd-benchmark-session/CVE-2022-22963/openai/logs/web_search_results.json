{
    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a vulnerability in Spring Cloud Function\u2019s routing feature that enables expression language injection via the HTTP header spring.cloud.function.routing-expression. When routing is enabled (e.g., via FunctionRouter or the spring-cloud-function-web module), the header value was evaluated in an unsafe context, allowing crafted SpEL expressions to be executed. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application process, with access to the local resources of the container/host. The issue affects Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions; fixed releases are 3.1.7 and 3.2.3. Typical preconditions include an HTTP-exposed Spring Cloud Function app using routing, with no authentication required. The fix introduced a dedicated, restricted header evaluation context and safer handling of header-sourced expressions. Timeline: Spring announced fixes on 2022-03-29; NVD published the CVE on 2022-04-01 (later updated).",

Build the app inside this image with Spring Cloud Function (spring-cloud-function-web) at version 3.1.6 or 3.2.2 (avoid fixed versions 3.1.7/3.2.3). Expose HTTP (e.g., port 8080) and enable routing so the application evaluates the spring.cloud.function.routing-expression header (e.g., via FunctionRouter). No additional web server, database, or other services are required to reproduce the vulnerability because Spring Boot provides the embedded HTTP container."
