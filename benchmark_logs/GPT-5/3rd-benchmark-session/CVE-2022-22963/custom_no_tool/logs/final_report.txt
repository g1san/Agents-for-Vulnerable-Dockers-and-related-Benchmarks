CVE description: CVE-2022-22963 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Functionâ€™s HTTP routing feature that allows a user-controlled Spring Expression Language (SpEL) string to be evaluated on the server. In affected releases (3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions), the framework supports routing requests to functions using a routing expression. The value of this routing expression can be supplied by a client (commonly via the HTTP header named spring.cloud.function.routing-expression). Because the expression is evaluated in a StandardEvaluationContext with access to core Java types, a malicious actor can craft a SpEL payload that is executed on the server. This enables the execution of arbitrary commands and access to local resources when the routing feature is exposed and accepts attacker-controlled input. Typical exploits target the Function Router endpoint (often /functionRouter in Spring Cloud Function WebFlux setups) and use SpEL to reach java.lang.Runtime or similar primitives to run system commands. The vulnerability affects applications that: (1) use Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6, 3.2.2, or older unsupported releases; (2) enable the routing functionality; and (3) allow an external party to control the routing expression (for example, via the spring.cloud.function.routing-expression HTTP header). The impact is severe because it permits full remote command execution in the context of the application process and thus can lead to complete host compromise, data exfiltration, and lateral movement. The issue is fixed in Spring Cloud Function 3.1.7 and 3.2.3, which introduced validation that prevents routing expressions from being supplied via HTTP headers and tightened evaluation paths. Mitigation is to upgrade to 3.1.7 or 3.2.3; no additional configuration changes are required once upgraded. Deployments are at risk across environments, including traditional servers and serverless platforms (for example, AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions) when the HTTP routing adapter is used and exposed to untrusted input.
Attack Type: Remote code execution via expression language injection (user-supplied Spring Expression Language evaluated on the server)
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [SOFT][maven][['3.8.6-eclipse-temurin-11']] Build-stage tool to compile and package the vulnerable Spring Cloud Function application into a runnable JAR during a multi-stage Docker build. Not required at runtime but necessary to create the Docker image.
- [SOFT][eclipse-temurin][['11-jre']] Java Runtime Environment to run the packaged Spring Cloud Function application that contains the vulnerable library (Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6 or 3.2.2) and exposes the HTTP routing endpoint. The application layer must include Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6 or 3.2.2 (or an older unsupported release) to be vulnerable.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!
