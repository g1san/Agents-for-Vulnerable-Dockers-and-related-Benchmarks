    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical flaw in JetBrains TeamCity On\u2011Premises (the continuous integration/continuous delivery server) that resides in the web application\u2019s authentication layer. In all TeamCity releases prior to 2023.05.4, a logic error in the web/REST authentication flow allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by sending crafted HTTP(S) requests to the TeamCity server (commonly exposed on port 8111). Once authentication is bypassed, the attacker can obtain administrative privileges and leverage built\u2011in TeamCity features to execute arbitrary code on the underlying server. Typical post\u2011bypass actions include creating administrator accounts or personal access tokens and then triggering code execution via build steps, agents, or plugin mechanisms. Because TeamCity orchestrates build and deployment pipelines and often stores or accesses sensitive assets (source code, signing certificates, secrets, and deployment credentials), a compromise can lead to complete server takeover and downstream supply\u2011chain compromise, including poisoning of build artifacts and takeover of connected build agents. The vulnerability was discovered by Sonar and disclosed on 2023\u201109\u201106, with active exploitation reported shortly afterward; it was added to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on 2023\u201110\u201104. Multiple threat actors, including Russian SVR/APT29, have reportedly exploited it in the wild; Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard notes active exploitation and the use of custom Python tooling and post\u2011exploitation behavior consistent with GraphicalProton. Public exploit code and a Metasploit module were released in October 2023. The issue is network\u2011exploitable, requires no prior authentication or user interaction, and carries a very high impact due to the ability to obtain administrator control and execute arbitrary code. Remediation requires upgrading TeamCity to 2023.05.4 or later (or applying JetBrains\u2019 security patch plugin) and limiting external exposure of the TeamCity web interface.",

The authentication bypass allowing unauthenticated remote code execution exists in the TeamCity web/REST authentication layer. A minimal, testable vulnerable Docker setup requires only the TeamCity server container; it includes an embedded web server and an internal database sufficient for basic operation, so no additional services are strictly required to expose and exercise the vulnerability."
