    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical authentication bypass (CWE-288/CWE-306) in JetBrains TeamCity On-Premises (self-hosted server) allowing unauthenticated network attackers over HTTP/HTTPS to access sensitive REST functionality and achieve remote code execution and full administrative takeover. The root cause was a logic flaw in request interception that allowed paths ending in \u201c/RPC2\u201d to skip authentication, exposing functions like token creation. Affected versions: all TeamCity On-Premises releases before 2023.05.4; fixed in 2023.05.4. TeamCity Cloud is not affected. The issue has been exploited in the wild and is listed in CISA KEV. Key dates: reported Sep 6, 2023; fixed Sep 18, 2023; disclosed Sep 21, 2023. (Sources: NVD, JetBrains advisories, SonarSource/industry analyses)",
