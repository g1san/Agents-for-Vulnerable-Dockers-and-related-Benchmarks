    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an improper access control defect in the Joomla core Web Services (REST API) introduced in Joomla 4 and present from versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7. Due to missing or flawed authorization checks on specific API endpoints, an unauthenticated remote user can submit crafted HTTP requests directly to Joomla\u2019s web service routes and retrieve data that should require elevated privileges. Commonly targeted endpoints include /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true (to enumerate user details) and /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true (to read the site configuration). The configuration endpoint may disclose highly sensitive information such as database type, host, username, and password, along with other application settings. Because the flaw affects the authorization logic, no valid session or credentials are needed\u2014only network reachability of the Joomla API over HTTP or HTTPS.\n\nThe vulnerability\u2019s root cause is insufficient access enforcement in Joomla 4\u2019s Web Services layer, where certain resources incorrectly accept the public parameter or otherwise bypass normal permission checks. Public proofs of concept show that simple unauthenticated GET requests to the exposed API routes can return structured JSON containing user accounts, group memberships, site metadata, and full database connection parameters in plaintext. The immediate impact is unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. This information disclosure can enable follow-on compromise, such as using leaked database credentials to access the backend database, pivoting to other systems, or escalating privileges within the application or hosting environment. The issue was assigned CVSS 5.3 and was fixed in Joomla 4.2.8 by correcting the access control checks on the affected web service endpoints. Recommended mitigations include updating to 4.2.8 or later, restricting access to the API endpoints, and placing the site behind a web application firewall with strict access rules.",
