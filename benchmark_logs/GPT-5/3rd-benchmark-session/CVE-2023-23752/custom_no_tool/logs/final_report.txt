CVE description: CVE-2023-23752 is an improper access control flaw in the Joomla 4 core Web Services (REST API) that leaves certain endpoints accessible to unauthenticated, remote users. In affected versions (Joomla 4.0.0 through 4.2.7), the application fails to enforce authorization checks on specific API routes exposed under /api/index.php. As a result, an attacker on the network can query these endpoints without credentials and retrieve sensitive configuration and user information that should be restricted to authenticated administrators.

The most security-relevant endpoints include:
- /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true, which can disclose site configuration details such as database connection parameters, including plaintext MySQL or MariaDB credentials when stored by Joomla.
- /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true, which can leak user account metadata (usernames, email addresses, and group memberships), aiding account enumeration and identifying Super Users.

The direct, confirmed impact is unauthenticated information disclosure. However, the disclosed data commonly enables further compromise under typical deployments. If the leaked database credentials are valid and the database server is reachable from the attacker’s host, the attacker may directly modify records in the Joomla database (for example, changing a Super User’s password or adding an administrative user). With resulting administrative access to the Joomla backend, an attacker can then leverage standard administrative features to achieve code execution on the underlying web server, for instance by editing a template to include executable code or by installing a malicious extension. Even when the database is not reachable, leaked user information can facilitate credential stuffing or targeted brute force attempts against known administrator accounts. The vendor remediated the issue in Joomla 4.2.8 by correcting access checks on the affected endpoints, and administrators are advised to upgrade and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed.

Key characteristics:
- Root cause: improper access checks in Joomla’s Web Services layer.
- Exposure: unauthenticated HTTP access to sensitive API endpoints.
- Primary risk: disclosure of configuration secrets and user account data, enabling administrative account takeover under common configurations.
- Remediation: upgrade Joomla to 4.2.8 or later and review/rotate leaked credentials; restrict database network exposure where possible.
Attack Type: Unauthenticated information disclosure that can enable administrator account takeover and subsequent remote code execution via legitimate administrative features
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][joomla][['4.0.0-apache', '4.0.1-apache', '4.0.2-apache', '4.0.3-apache', '4.0.4-apache', '4.0.5-apache', '4.0.6-apache', '4.1.0-apache', '4.1.1-apache', '4.1.2-apache', '4.1.3-apache', '4.1.4-apache', '4.1.5-apache', '4.2.0-apache', '4.2.1-apache', '4.2.2-apache', '4.2.3-apache', '4.2.4-apache', '4.2.5-apache', '4.2.6-apache', '4.2.7-apache']] The Joomla application itself (with built-in Apache and PHP in the official image) provides the vulnerable Web Services endpoints. Versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7 are affected; selecting any one of these tags will yield a container vulnerable to CVE-2023-23752.
- [SOFT-DB][mariadb][['10.6']] Relational database required by Joomla to run. While not necessary to trigger the unauthenticated information disclosure, a database is required for a functional Joomla site and for reproducing realistic impact (e.g., configuration storage and user data). Version 10.6 is compatible with Joomla 4 and the official joomla image.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
