    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is an improper access control flaw in the Joomla 4 core Web Services (REST API) that leaves certain endpoints accessible to unauthenticated, remote users. In affected versions (Joomla 4.0.0 through 4.2.7), the application fails to enforce authorization checks on specific API routes exposed under /api/index.php. As a result, an attacker on the network can query these endpoints without credentials and retrieve sensitive configuration and user information that should be restricted to authenticated administrators.\n\nThe most security-relevant endpoints include:\n- /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true, which can disclose site configuration details such as database connection parameters, including plaintext MySQL or MariaDB credentials when stored by Joomla.\n- /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true, which can leak user account metadata (usernames, email addresses, and group memberships), aiding account enumeration and identifying Super Users.\n\nThe direct, confirmed impact is unauthenticated information disclosure. However, the disclosed data commonly enables further compromise under typical deployments. If the leaked database credentials are valid and the database server is reachable from the attacker\u2019s host, the attacker may directly modify records in the Joomla database (for example, changing a Super User\u2019s password or adding an administrative user). With resulting administrative access to the Joomla backend, an attacker can then leverage standard administrative features to achieve code execution on the underlying web server, for instance by editing a template to include executable code or by installing a malicious extension. Even when the database is not reachable, leaked user information can facilitate credential stuffing or targeted brute force attempts against known administrator accounts. The vendor remediated the issue in Joomla 4.2.8 by correcting access checks on the affected endpoints, and administrators are advised to upgrade and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- Root cause: improper access checks in Joomla\u2019s Web Services layer.\n- Exposure: unauthenticated HTTP access to sensitive API endpoints.\n- Primary risk: disclosure of configuration secrets and user account data, enabling administrative account takeover under common configurations.\n- Remediation: upgrade Joomla to 4.2.8 or later and review/rotate leaked credentials; restrict database network exposure where possible.",
