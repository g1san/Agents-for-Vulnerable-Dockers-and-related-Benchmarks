    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 affects Joomla! CMS 4.x only, specifically versions 4.0.0 through 4.2.7 (fixed in 4.2.8). It is an improper access control flaw in Joomla\u2019s web services (REST API) that allows unauthenticated remote access to endpoints intended to be permission-gated, enabling information disclosure such as Joomla configuration (including plaintext DB credentials) and user listings. Reachable over HTTP(S) without authentication and low complexity. NVD CVSS v3.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3, Medium). Reported Feb 13, 2023; fixed Feb 16, 2023; later added to CISA KEV on Jan 8, 2024. Exploitation requires a Joomla 4.x site with the API entry point (api/index.php) exposed; mitigations targeted API paths and a query-parameter condition, corroborating the exposure mechanism. Sources: Joomla Security Centre advisory, NVD, and independent analyses (e.g., VulnCheck).",
