    "desc": "CVE-2023-23752 is a vulnerability in Joomla! core Web Services (introduced in Joomla 4) caused by improper access control on several API endpoints. In affected releases (Joomla 4.0.0 through 4.2.7), an unauthenticated remote user can directly query the Web Services API without a valid token and retrieve sensitive configuration and user data. Commonly exposed endpoints include: /api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true, which returns site configuration including database connection details in plaintext (database type, host, username, password, and database name), and /api/index.php/v1/users?public=true, which enumerates users and their groups (including Super Users). Because the API is enabled by default in Joomla 4, any Internet-reachable Joomla instance in the vulnerable version range is at risk without any additional prerequisites.\n\nImpact and escalation paths: The immediate impact is sensitive information disclosure. The leaked database credentials often allow direct access to the site\u2019s relational database if it is reachable, enabling an attacker to modify critical records such as the Super User\u2019s password hash in the users table. With administrative access subsequently obtained, the attacker can log into the backend and perform actions that lead to full site compromise, including uploading or installing extensions, editing templates, and achieving server-side code execution through legitimate administrative features. Even when database access is not reachable from the attacker\u2019s network location, disclosure of user lists and email addresses facilitates credential stuffing or brute-force attempts against privileged accounts. The issue requires only network access to the Joomla API endpoints and no authentication. It was fixed in Joomla 4.2.8 by correcting the access checks on the webservice endpoints.\n\nAuthoritative sources (NVD/MITRE and multiple security writeups) identify the affected versions as 4.0.0 through 4.2.7, with 4.2.8 and later not vulnerable. The vulnerability is reachable via simple unauthenticated HTTP requests to the API endpoints and does not depend on optional extensions beyond Joomla core.",
