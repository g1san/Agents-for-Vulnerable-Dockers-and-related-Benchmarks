    "desc": "Eclipse Jetty (HTTP server and Servlet container) improperly handled URL/URI normalization and decoding in versions 9.4.37\u20139.4.42, 10.0.1\u201310.0.5, and 11.0.1\u201311.0.5. Crafted request URIs with encoded characters (e.g., Unicode-encoded dots %u002e or encoded nulls) could bypass security constraints and expose resources under WEB-INF that should never be directly served. Root cause: a change to normalize-before-decode and alias handling introduced double-normalization/alias ambiguities; fix restored decode-then-normalize and rejected ambiguous segments unless explicitly allowed. Impact: unauthorized disclosure/bypass of access controls; CVSS base 5.3. Affected ecosystems relying on Jetty updated to fixed versions (9.4.43, 10.0.6, 11.0.6+).",
