    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server and servlet container that allows an unauthenticated remote party to access resources that should be blocked under the WEB-INF path of a deployed web application. Jetty\u2019s request handling pipeline performed normalization and decoding of Uniform Resource Identifier path segments in an order that let specially encoded characters (for example, Unicode-encoded dot or a dot combined with a null byte) bypass the security checks that normally prevent direct access to WEB-INF and similar protected locations. In default compliance mode, a crafted request such as \u201c/%u002e/WEB-INF/web.xml\u201d or \u201c/.%00/WEB-INF/web.xml\u201d could be accepted and routed to the underlying resource, exposing files that typically contain sensitive configuration, classpath resources, or application metadata. The flaw is in the Jetty WebApp component (org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-webapp). The issue arose when a change to make normalization align with standard-compliant behavior occurred before decoding, and PathResource behavior allowed aliasing; as a result, protection logic executed against a path representation that did not yet reflect the later-decoded, security-relevant characters. This variant is closely related to earlier improper URI normalization issues and affected multiple Jetty release lines. The impact is unauthorized exposure of sensitive information from the server or application, with no authentication, privileges, or user interaction required; only network access to the Jetty HTTP endpoint is needed. According to authoritative sources (NIST NVD and the official Jetty advisory), the affected versions are Jetty 9.4.37 through 9.4.42, Jetty 10.0.1 through 10.0.5, and Jetty 11.0.1 through 11.0.5; fixes are available in 9.4.43, 10.0.6, and 11.0.6. Practical manifestations include successful retrieval of WEB-INF/web.xml on an otherwise protected application and potential exposure of other resources mapped beneath WEB-INF. Recommended mitigations are to upgrade to the patched versions; as interim measures, administrators can deploy rewrite or validation rules that reject raw URIs containing encoded dot segments or null bytes, and restrict direct access to sensitive paths at the reverse proxy if present. The vulnerability is cataloged as information disclosure with low attack complexity and no need for authentication or user interaction.",
