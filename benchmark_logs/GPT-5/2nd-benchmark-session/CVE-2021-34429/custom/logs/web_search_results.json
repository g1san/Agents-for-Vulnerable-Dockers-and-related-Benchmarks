    "desc": "CVE-2021-34429 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server and Servlet container caused by improper normalization of request Uniform Resource Identifiers. In affected versions, Jetty\u2019s normalization logic fails to consistently handle certain percent-encoded characters and path segments during security constraint and resource resolution checks. As a result, an attacker can craft HTTP requests whose decoded paths are evaluated differently by the constraint enforcement and the resource access layers. This mismatch enables unintended access to resources that should be protected by application or server-level constraints. Notably, it allows exposure of files under the WEB-INF directory (such as WEB-INF/web.xml) and can bypass declarative security constraints defined in web.xml or programmatic constraints, leading to unauthorized retrieval of restricted content. The issue is closely related to and considered a variant of CVE-2021-28164, stemming from edge cases in URI path normalization and validation. Preconditions for exploitation are minimal: the attacker only needs network access to the Jetty HTTP endpoint; no authentication is required and no special server configuration beyond hosting a web application with constraints or protected resources is necessary. Impact includes disclosure of sensitive configuration or application files and unauthorized access to restricted endpoints, potentially facilitating further compromise depending on the exposed content. Remediation is to upgrade Jetty to a fixed release (9.4.43 or newer in the 9.x line, 10.0.6 or newer in the 10.x line, or 11.0.6 or newer in the 11.x line) and to ensure proper request path normalization and constraint configuration.",
