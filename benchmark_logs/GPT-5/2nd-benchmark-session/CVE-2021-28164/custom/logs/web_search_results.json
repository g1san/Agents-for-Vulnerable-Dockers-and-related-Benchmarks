    "desc": "CVE-2021-28164 is an information disclosure flaw in the Eclipse Jetty HTTP server and servlet container that stems from inconsistent normalization and validation of request-target Uniform Resource Identifier paths across Jetty components. In Jetty\u2019s default compliance mode, certain percent-encoded path elements such as encoded dot and dot-dot segments (%2e and %2e%2e), encoded slashes (%2F), and the use of matrix-parameter semicolons can be processed differently by the layers responsible for security constraint checks versus the components that actually serve resources (for example, DefaultServlet and static resource handlers). Because of this inconsistency, a remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft URLs whose visible path appears constrained while, after decoding and normalization by the serving component, the request resolves to a protected location. Typical demonstrations include paths like /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml or other variants that traverse to areas intended to be inaccessible (such as WEB-INF or similar protected directories) and cause Jetty to return sensitive files or metadata. The vulnerability requires only network access to the Jetty HTTP interface and specially crafted HTTP requests; no additional middleware, authentication, or user interaction is required. The issue affects Jetty\u2019s request-target parsing and normalization logic, allowing bypass of path containment and security constraints and resulting in unauthorized exposure of static resources and application configuration. Multiple vendors that embed Jetty (for example, IBM InfoSphere Information Server, Oracle products via the patch set that also covers this issue, and Dell SRM/SMR) acknowledged exposure through the bundled Jetty component. According to the National Vulnerability Database, affected upstream Jetty versions include 9.4.37.v20210219 through 9.4.38.v20210224. Remediation is to upgrade Jetty to a fixed release as referenced by Eclipse Jetty advisories (for example, the advisory corresponding to GHSA-v7ff-8wcx-gmc5) or vendor patches. The practical exploitation vector is purely over HTTP(S): an attacker sends crafted URLs containing encoded dot segments or matrix parameters to traverse or bypass restrictions, and the DefaultServlet or similar resource handlers then serve the unintended resource, leading to information disclosure.",
