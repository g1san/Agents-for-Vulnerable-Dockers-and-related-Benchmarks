CVE description: CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin’s web interface that stems from improper validation in the page loading/redirection logic, enabling path traversal that results in local file inclusion. An attacker who can reach the phpMyAdmin application can manipulate parameters so that phpMyAdmin includes arbitrary files from the server’s filesystem. In practical terms, this allows reading sensitive local files such as PHP session files, web server logs, application configuration files, or other readable resources under the web server’s user permissions. Because phpMyAdmin runs within a PHP-enabled web server context, this local file inclusion creates powerful pivot opportunities: by poisoning log files or session files with attacker-controlled PHP code and then leveraging the inclusion primitive, an attacker can escalate to remote code execution. While a normal exploitation path often presumes an authenticated phpMyAdmin session, certain configurations weaken or remove that requirement—for example, enabling the setting to allow arbitrary servers or using a default server setting that triggers the vulnerable code path without login. The vulnerability affected phpMyAdmin releases in the 4.8.x line and was remediated in later updates by tightening the whitelist and inclusion logic. Mitigations include upgrading to a fixed version, restricting access to phpMyAdmin, disabling permissive configuration options, and enforcing strong authentication and network-layer protections.
Attack Type: Local file inclusion with potential escalation to remote code execution via file poisoning and path traversal
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.8.0---4.8.3']] phpMyAdmin is the vulnerable application. Versions 4.8.0 through 4.8.3 contain the local file inclusion flaw (notably cited by multiple sources); NIST additionally notes 4.8.x before 4.8.2 as vulnerable, which is encompassed within this range. The official Docker image bundles the required PHP runtime and web server components, so no additional services are strictly necessary to run and test the vulnerable interface.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
