----------------------------------------


CVE description: phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 are vulnerable due to insufficient whitelist validation and decoding behavior in page loading/redirect logic (index.php). By passing a crafted, double-encoded target parameter, an attacker can bypass allowed-page checks and trigger inclusion of arbitrary local files. This enables reading sensitive files and, in typical setups, escalating to remote code execution by including attacker-influenced files such as session files or logs. The issue was disclosed in June 2018 and fixed in 4.8.2. Authentication is usually required, but certain configurations ($cfg['ServerDefault']=0 or $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true) can expose the vulnerable path without login or broaden exploitation avenues.
Attack Type: Local file inclusion that can enable remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpmyadmin][['4.8.0', '4.8.1']] Vulnerable web application exposing the local file inclusion flaw; required core service.
- [SOFT][mariadb][['10.3']] MySQL-compatible backend to allow phpMyAdmin authentication and normal operation when reproducing the authenticated exploitation path.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
