    "desc": "phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 are vulnerable due to insufficient whitelist validation and decoding behavior in page loading/redirect logic (index.php). By passing a crafted, double-encoded target parameter, an attacker can bypass allowed-page checks and trigger inclusion of arbitrary local files. This enables reading sensitive files and, in typical setups, escalating to remote code execution by including attacker-influenced files such as session files or logs. The issue was disclosed in June 2018 and fixed in 4.8.2. Authentication is usually required, but certain configurations ($cfg['ServerDefault']=0 or $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true) can expose the vulnerable path without login or broaden exploitation avenues.",
