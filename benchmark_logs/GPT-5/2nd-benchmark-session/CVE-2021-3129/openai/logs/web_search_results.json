    "desc": "CVE-2021-3129 is a critical flaw in the Ignition error-handling/debug package used by the Laravel PHP framework. When debug mode (APP_DEBUG=true) is enabled, unsafe file_get_contents/file_put_contents usage in Ignition\u2019s runnable solution allowed path-trusting abuses (including stream wrappers) that enabled arbitrary file reads/writes and led to remote code execution. The issue affects Ignition before 2.5.2 and is exploitable on Laravel applications before 8.4.2 with debug mode enabled. The fix (Ignition 2.5.2) restricts paths to .blade.php and disallows stream wrappers. The vulnerability is rated critical (CVSS 9.8) and has been exploited in the wild.",
