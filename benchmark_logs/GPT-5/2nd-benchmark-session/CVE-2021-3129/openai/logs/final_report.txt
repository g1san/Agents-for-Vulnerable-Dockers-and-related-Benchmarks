----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2021-3129 is a critical flaw in the Ignition error-handling/debug package used by the Laravel PHP framework. When debug mode (APP_DEBUG=true) is enabled, unsafe file_get_contents/file_put_contents usage in Ignitionâ€™s runnable solution allowed path-trusting abuses (including stream wrappers) that enabled arbitrary file reads/writes and led to remote code execution. The issue affects Ignition before 2.5.2 and is exploitable on Laravel applications before 8.4.2 with debug mode enabled. The fix (Ignition 2.5.2) restricts paths to .blade.php and disallows stream wrappers. The vulnerability is rated critical (CVSS 9.8) and has been exploited in the wild.
Attack Type: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) via debug interface and unsafe file operations
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][facade/ignition][['< 2.5.2']] Ignition debug/error-handling package vulnerable to unsafe file operations enabling RCE through the debug interface when Laravel debug mode is on.
- [HARD][laravel/laravel (framework)][['< 8.4.2 (exploitable when APP_DEBUG=true)']] Laravel applications with debug mode enabled expose the Ignition debug interface path through which the vulnerability is triggered.
- [SOFT][Web server and PHP runtime (e.g., Nginx/Apache + PHP-FPM)][['Any (not CVE-specific)']] Delivers HTTP requests to the Laravel app and runs PHP. Part of the hosting stack, not the origin of the vulnerability.
- [SOFT][Relational database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL)][['Optional; not required for exploitation']] Common in Laravel deployments but not necessary to trigger the Ignition debug-interface flaw.
- [SOFT][Ancillary runtime components (process manager, logging, PHP extensions)][['Varies']] Supportive components required by typical Laravel apps; not the source of the CVE.
