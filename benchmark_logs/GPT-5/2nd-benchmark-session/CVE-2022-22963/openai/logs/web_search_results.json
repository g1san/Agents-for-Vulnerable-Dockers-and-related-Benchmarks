    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 affects Spring Cloud Function\u2019s function routing feature when used with the web adapter (e.g., spring-cloud-function-web). The header spring.cloud.function.routing-expression is evaluated as a SpEL expression in an overly permissive evaluation context, allowing attacker-controlled expressions to access powerful types/methods. This enables unauthenticated remote clients to trigger expression injection that can lead to reading local resources and, in common deployments, remote execution of arbitrary code in the application process. Affected versions include Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions; fixed in 3.1.7 and 3.2.3. NVD classifies it under CWE-917 (expression language injection) and CWE-94 (code injection/generation). Severity is critical and it is listed in CISA KEV; exploitation was observed in the wild. The patch constrains header evaluation via a safer evaluation context and additional validation.",
