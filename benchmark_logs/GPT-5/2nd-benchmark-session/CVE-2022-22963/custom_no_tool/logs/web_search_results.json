    "desc": "CVE-2022-22963 is a critical flaw in Spring Cloud Function\u2019s routing feature that allows remote code execution when an application exposes Spring Cloud Function over HTTP and evaluates the header named spring.cloud.function.routing-expression. In affected releases (3.1.6, 3.2.2, and older unsupported versions), the framework evaluates attacker-controlled input as a Spring Expression Language expression using the standard evaluation context. By crafting a malicious expression (for example, invoking java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the running service, access local resources, and fully compromise the container or host environment. The issue is triggered specifically when the routing functionality is enabled (commonly via the functionRouter endpoint), and exploitation occurs purely over HTTP by sending a request with the malicious routing-expression header. No authentication is required for the attack if the endpoint is exposed. The vulnerability is fixed in Spring Cloud Function 3.1.7 and 3.2.3, and upgrading to one of these versions removes the issue without requiring further configuration changes.",

It bundles a vulnerable Spring Cloud Function version (3.1.6 or 3.2.2), making the container directly susceptible to CVE-2022-22963 over HTTP without additional services. No external database, cache, message queue, or web server is required because the application uses the embedded HTTP stack from Spring."
