    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a directory traversal flaw in Grafana\u2019s plugin asset handler that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the host running Grafana. The vulnerable path pattern is /public/plugins/<plugin-id>, where insufficient path normalization allowed traversal sequences to escape the plugin asset directory. Affected versions are Grafana 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0; fixes were released in 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, and 8.3.1. Impact is high confidentiality (arbitrary file read), with no direct integrity or availability impact. Grafana Cloud was not affected. Default installations are exposed because core plugins ship preinstalled, making the vulnerable endpoints present by default.
