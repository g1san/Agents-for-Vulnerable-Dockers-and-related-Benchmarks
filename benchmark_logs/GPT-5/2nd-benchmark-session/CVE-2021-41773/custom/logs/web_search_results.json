    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server caused by a defect in the path normalization logic within the core request processing (notably in ap_normalize_path). In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, the server insufficiently normalized and validated URL-encoded traversal sequences, decoding only the first dot in patterns such as .%2e/ or similar. This flaw allowed carefully crafted request paths to traverse outside of directories exposed via Alias-like directives and, under certain non-default configurations, access files on the filesystem beyond the intended document root boundaries. If those external locations were not protected by the default access control of \u201cRequire all denied,\u201d attackers could retrieve arbitrary files, resulting in unauthorized file disclosure. In environments where Common Gateway Interface execution was enabled and reachable through aliased paths (for example, a publicly accessible cgi-bin), attackers could leverage the traversal to reach and execute CGI scripts, which could enable arbitrary command execution under the privileges of the web server. The issue was actively exploited in the wild. The vendor initially attempted to remediate the defect in version 2.4.50; however, that fix was incomplete and resulted in a closely related vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-42013. A complete fix for both issues is available starting with Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51. Authoritative sources (such as NIST/NVD) track CVE-2021-41773 as affecting Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 specifically, with the follow-on incomplete fix separately covered by CVE-2021-42013 in 2.4.50. Proper mitigations include upgrading to 2.4.51 or later, enforcing restrictive access controls (for example, retaining \u201cRequire all denied\u201d on filesystem/aliased paths unless explicitly needed), and disabling or tightly restricting Common Gateway Interface if not required.",
