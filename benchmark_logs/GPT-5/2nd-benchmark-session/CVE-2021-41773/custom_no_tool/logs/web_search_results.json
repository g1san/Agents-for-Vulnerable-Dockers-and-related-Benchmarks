    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) introduced by a change to the core path normalization routine in version 2.4.49. The flaw allows an attacker to craft URLs that bypass canonicalization safeguards and traverse outside the intended web document root or outside directories mapped by Alias-like directives. Specifically, Apache\u2019s path normalization (ap_normalize_path) in 2.4.49 decodes only part of certain encoded traversal sequences; by using mixed encoded dot patterns such as .%2e/ (instead of ../), an attacker can evade the normalization logic and access filesystem locations that should not be reachable via the web server. The default access model in modern Apache configurations denies access to filesystem paths unless explicitly allowed; however, misconfigurations where \u201cRequire all granted\u201d is applied broadly (for example, at the root or to aliased directories) or where the external paths lack the default \u201cRequire all denied\u201d protection can permit successful requests. The immediate impact is unauthorized file disclosure: an attacker can retrieve arbitrary files outside the DocumentRoot or aliased directory, such as system files or application sources, if the webserver process has read permissions. The risk escalates when Common Gateway Interface execution is enabled for an aliased path (e.g., /cgi-bin with mod_cgi or mod_cgid): by traversing into that location, an attacker may invoke executable CGI scripts and supply parameters to them, which can result in remote code execution depending on script behavior and server configuration. The issue was observed being exploited in the wild shortly after disclosure. Version scope: the National Vulnerability Database and Apache HTTP Server project state that CVE-2021-41773 affects only Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. Apache released 2.4.50 to fix this flaw, but that fix was incomplete and led to a closely related follow-on vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-42013 (affecting 2.4.49\u20132.4.50). Definitive remediation is to upgrade to 2.4.51 or later. Short-term mitigations (less reliable than upgrading) include ensuring that non-public directories are explicitly protected by \u201cRequire all denied,\u201d avoiding overly permissive access directives at or near the server root, and disabling or restricting CGI execution where not strictly needed.",

No additional services are required; necessary behaviors (document root, Alias directives, and optional Common Gateway Interface) are configured within httpd itself."
