    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a path normalization flaw in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 that allows directory traversal and file disclosure via mixed-encoded dot segments (e.g., /.%2e/). It primarily affects Alias-like mappings (Alias, ScriptAlias, etc.) where files outside the mapped directories lack explicit access controls (e.g., missing \"Require all denied\"). Only 2.4.49 is vulnerable; 2.4.50\u2019s fix was incomplete (CVE-2021-42013) and 2.4.51 fully resolves both. Exploitation was observed in the wild, commonly targeting files like /etc/passwd. Under additional conditions where CGI is enabled and reachable via traversal, remote code execution may be possible.",

Optional enabling of CGI (e.g., mod_cgi/ScriptAlias) within those paths can lead to RCE, still using only this service."
