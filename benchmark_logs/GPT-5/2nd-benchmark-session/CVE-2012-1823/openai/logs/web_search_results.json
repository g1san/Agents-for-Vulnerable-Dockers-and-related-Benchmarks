    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is an argument-injection flaw in PHP\u2019s CGI SAPI (php-cgi). When PHP is invoked via CGI, specially crafted query strings without an equals sign could be interpreted as php-cgi command-line options due to improper option parsing in sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c. This allows remote attackers to control runtime behavior (e.g., via -d or -s), leading to code execution, source disclosure, or resource exhaustion. Only CGI deployments are affected; module/FPM setups are not. Vulnerable versions are PHP before 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4.x before 5.4.2 when configured as CGI. Initial fixes were incomplete, prompting follow-on CVEs (2012-2311, 2012-2336).",
