----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2012-1823 is an argument-injection flaw in PHP’s CGI SAPI (php-cgi). When PHP is invoked via CGI, specially crafted query strings without an equals sign could be interpreted as php-cgi command-line options due to improper option parsing in sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c. This allows remote attackers to control runtime behavior (e.g., via -d or -s), leading to code execution, source disclosure, or resource exhaustion. Only CGI deployments are affected; module/FPM setups are not. Vulnerable versions are PHP before 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4.x before 5.4.2 when configured as CGI. Initial fixes were incomplete, prompting follow-on CVEs (2012-2311, 2012-2336).
Attack Type: Unauthenticated remote code execution via CGI argument injection into php-cgi; also enables source code disclosure and potential service disruption.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['5.3.0–5.3.11', '5.4.0–5.4.1', 'Any PHP release before 5.3.12 when configured as CGI (php-cgi)']] Vulnerable component. Must run the PHP interpreter as CGI (php-cgi) in an affected version to expose the flawed argument-parsing path.
- [SOFT][httpd][['2.4.x']] Provides an HTTP endpoint and invokes php-cgi via classic CGI (e.g., mod_cgi/mod_actions), making the vulnerability reachable over the network. The web server itself is not vulnerable; it must support CGI to execute php-cgi.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!
