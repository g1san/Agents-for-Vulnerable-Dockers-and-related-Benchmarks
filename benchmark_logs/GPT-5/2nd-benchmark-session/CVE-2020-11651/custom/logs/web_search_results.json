    "desc": "CVE-2020-11651 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in SaltStack Salt\u2019s master component (salt-master). In affected releases, the ClearFuncs class on the master exposes certain methods without enforcing authentication. Remote, unauthenticated users can directly invoke these master-exposed methods over the publisher interface. By abusing these methods, an attacker can obtain valid user tokens from the master and then leverage the master\u2019s orchestration capabilities to issue commands to connected minions. Because Salt\u2019s design allows the master to execute privileged operations across its managed infrastructure, a successful attack enables an adversary to pivot from the master to the entire fleet of minions. The practical impact is severe: an unauthenticated outsider can first gain master-level capabilities and then trigger arbitrary command execution on minion hosts that trust the compromised master. This issue affects Salt versions prior to the fixed releases in the 2019.2 and 3000 lines (fixed in 2019.2.4 and 3000.2). The flaw is distinct from, but often discussed alongside, a separate directory traversal issue (CVE-2020-11652); together they highlighted how unauthenticated access to sensitive master interfaces can lead to full compromise of managed systems. In summary, CVE-2020-11651 allows remote, unauthenticated access to privileged master functions, token theft, and the subsequent execution of arbitrary commands on minions under that master\u2019s control.",
