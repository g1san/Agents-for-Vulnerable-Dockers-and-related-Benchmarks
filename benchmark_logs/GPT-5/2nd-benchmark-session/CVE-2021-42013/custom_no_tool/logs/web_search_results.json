    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a critical flaw in Apache HTTP Server where the initial fix for CVE-2021-41773 was incomplete. In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, a crafted HTTP request can bypass path normalization and traversal protections, allowing an attacker to map URLs to files outside of the directories intended to be exposed by Alias-like directives (for example, locations mapped with Alias or ScriptAlias). If those external filesystem locations are not protected by the default access control of \u201cRequire all denied,\u201d an unauthenticated remote attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files or application source code. Furthermore, if Common Gateway Interface execution is enabled on the aliased path (for example, via ScriptAlias or by allowing execution with Options +ExecCGI in a Directory context), the vulnerability can be escalated from file disclosure to arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Apache HTTP Server process. Exploitation requires only network access to the vulnerable service and does not require authentication. Earlier 2.4.x releases before 2.4.49 are not affected; the issue was fully addressed in 2.4.51 by strengthening path normalization and access control checks in the core request handling combined with additional fixes around Alias-like mappings, as documented by the Apache HTTP Server project and national vulnerability databases.",

Versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 are affected when Alias-like directives are present and access controls are not correctly denying traversal to external paths; enabling Common Gateway Interface on those aliased paths enables escalation to arbitrary command execution. In Docker, use the official httpd image and configure httpd.conf to include an exposed Alias (for example, icons), set a Directory block with \u201cRequire all granted,\u201d and enable mod_cgi with a ScriptAlias or Options +ExecCGI to make the instance demonstrably vulnerable."
