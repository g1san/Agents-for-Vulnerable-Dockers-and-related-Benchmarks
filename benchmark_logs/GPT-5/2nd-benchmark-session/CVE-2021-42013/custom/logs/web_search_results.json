    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server arising from an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773. In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50, the path normalization routine (ap_normalize_path) does not fully decode percent-encoded sequences before performing normalization and traversal checks. As a result, crafted URL paths that contain encoded traversal sequences (for example, variations of .%2e/ or similar encodings) can bypass the checks meant to prevent access outside the intended web directories. Practically, this allows an attacker with simple HTTP access to request files that lie outside the configured DocumentRoot or outside directories defined by Alias-like directives. The impact is strongly influenced by server configuration. When directories outside the document root or aliased targets are not protected by the default access control of \u201cRequire all denied,\u201d an attacker can read arbitrary files that the web server process can access. Furthermore, when Common Gateway Interface (CGI) execution is enabled (for example via mod_cgi or mod_cgid) on aliased paths such as cgi-bin, the vulnerability can escalate to remote code execution by invoking or uploading/invoking CGI or shell scripts reachable through the traversal. Only Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 are affected; earlier 2.4 releases are not impacted, and the issue is fixed in 2.4.51 and later. Successful exploitation requires only network access to the vulnerable server and a misconfiguration that either grants overly broad access (such as Require all granted at an unsafe scope) or enables CGI execution on paths reachable via traversal. Mitigations include upgrading to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 or newer, restoring the default-deny posture on non-public paths (Require all denied), avoiding broad access grants at the root, and restricting or disabling CGI execution (mod_cgi/mod_cgid) unless strictly necessary.",
