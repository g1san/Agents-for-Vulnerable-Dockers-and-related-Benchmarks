    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 is a path traversal vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server where the incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773 in 2.4.50 allowed crafted requests to traverse outside aliased directories. If those outside-tree locations lack the default \"Require all denied,\" files can be disclosed. When CGI is enabled on reachable aliased paths, this can lead to remote code execution. Only 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 are affected; 2.4.51 contains the complete fix.",
