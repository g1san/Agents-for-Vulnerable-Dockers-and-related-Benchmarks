    "desc": "CVE-2016-5734 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin\u2019s Find & Replace feature that allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary PHP code through crafted input that is evaluated server-side. The root cause is the use of preg_replace with the evaluation modifier combined with unsafe delimiter handling, which permits attacker-controlled replacement strings to be interpreted as PHP code. In affected phpMyAdmin versions, a user logged into the web interface can visit endpoints involved in table search-and-replace and submit parameters that turn the replacement into executable PHP. A common exploit path abuses a regular-expression null-byte trick to smuggle the evaluation modifier through, so that the replacement payload is evaluated in the PHP interpreter. Once triggered, the payload runs with the privileges of the web server process, leading to full execution of operating system commands from within the phpMyAdmin context. Practical exploitation requires network access to a reachable phpMyAdmin instance, valid phpMyAdmin credentials (to reach the Find & Replace workflow and obtain a valid anti\u2013cross-site request forgery token), and at least one accessible database/table so the feature can be invoked. Public demonstrations show posting to tbl_find_replace.php with useRegex enabled and a crafted find pattern and replacement string that contains PHP code, often leveraging system or similar functions to spawn a shell under the web server user. The National Vulnerability Database states the affected release lines as phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3; the flaw stems from improper delimiter selection that enables the evaluation modifier, resulting in arbitrary PHP code execution. In practice, deployers typically run phpMyAdmin behind an embedded Apache and PHP runtime (as provided by the phpMyAdmin Docker image) and attach it to a MySQL-compatible database; the database itself is not vulnerable but is necessary for the application workflow that exposes the bug. Because the payload is evaluated by PHP inside the application, exploitation yields code execution on the host serving phpMyAdmin, not merely within the database. Authentication is required, but once authenticated the attacker can achieve full code execution through the web interface by issuing crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.",
