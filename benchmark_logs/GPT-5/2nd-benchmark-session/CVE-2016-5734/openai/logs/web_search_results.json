    "desc": "phpMyAdmin\u2019s table search-and-replace feature used preg_replace in a way that allowed user-controlled input to affect regex delimiters and flags, enabling the legacy 'e' (evaluate) modifier. This caused the replacement string to be executed as PHP code, leading to server-side code execution. Affected phpMyAdmin versions are 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3. While newer PHP versions reduced exploitability (e.g., removing evaluate behavior in PHP 7.0), the root flaw was in phpMyAdmin\u2019s input handling and was fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.16, 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.3.",
