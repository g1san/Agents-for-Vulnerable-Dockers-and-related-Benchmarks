    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a server-side path traversal flaw in SaltStack Salt\u2019s salt-master component, specifically within the ClearFuncs interface that exposes certain \u201cclear\u201d (unauthenticated transport layer) functions to clients. In affected releases, some ClearFuncs methods insufficiently sanitize user-controlled filesystem paths. By supplying crafted path arguments containing traversal sequences (for example, sequences like ../), an authenticated caller of these ClearFuncs can cause the master to read from or write to arbitrary directories on the master host. This enables arbitrary directory access, including arbitrary file read and arbitrary file write operations relative to the master\u2019s filesystem. Practically, an attacker with valid credentials for invoking the affected ClearFuncs can abuse these methods to exfiltrate sensitive files (for example, configuration files, system password files) or place attacker-chosen files in writable locations, potentially paving the way for further compromise. The flaw is typically reachable via the salt-master\u2019s native transport and is often also exposed through deployments that front the master with salt-api over HTTP, making it easier to interact with from remote clients. The vulnerability affects Salt before the fixed versions in both the 2019.2.x and 3000.x branches and was corrected in releases 2019.2.4 and 3000.2 by strengthening path validation and sanitization. Mitigation consists of upgrading the salt-master to at least 2019.2.4 (for 2019.2.x) or 3000.2 (for 3000.x), or newer supported versions.",
