    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Salt\u2019s master process (salt-master) within ClearFuncs. Certain methods failed to sanitize user-supplied paths, allowing an authenticated Salt user to traverse out of intended directories and access arbitrary file paths on the master, enabling arbitrary file reads and, in some cases, writes. It affects Salt before 2019.2.4 and Salt 3000 before 3000.2. The flaw is reachable via the master\u2019s request server (typically TCP 4506) when the master is network-accessible. In practice, attackers often chained it with CVE-2020-11651 (authentication bypass) to remove authentication requirements and achieve full compromise of the master.",
