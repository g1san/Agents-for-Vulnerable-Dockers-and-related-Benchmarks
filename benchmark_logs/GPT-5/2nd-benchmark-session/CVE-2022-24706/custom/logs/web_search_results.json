    "desc": "CVE-2022-24706 is a security flaw in Apache CouchDB where, on default or weakly secured deployments, an unauthenticated remote party can obtain administrative privileges. In affected versions prior to the fixed release, CouchDB\u2019s default posture on improperly secured instances (for example, those left in the initial setup state or with no administrative user defined and exposed to untrusted networks) can be abused so that an attacker gains full administrative access without providing valid credentials. This effectively bypasses authentication and elevates the attacker\u2019s privileges to an administrator. Once administrative access is obtained, the attacker can perform complete database administration operations, including creating or deleting databases, reading and modifying data, creating new administrative users, changing configuration, enabling or disabling features, and potentially deploying malicious configuration changes that persist. Successful exploitation typically requires that the CouchDB service is reachable by the attacker (such as being bound to a public interface or otherwise exposed through misconfigured networking) and that the instance remains in, or has reverted to, a default or weakly secured state. The issue is resolved in Apache CouchDB 3.2.2 and later; mitigation guidance includes upgrading to 3.2.2 or newer, ensuring an administrative user is configured, disabling or restricting setup endpoints after initialization, following official hardening practices, and limiting network exposure via firewalling and access controls. The National Vulnerability Database characterizes the flaw as allowing granting of admin privileges without authentication on default, improperly secured installations and recommends upgrading and restricting exposure.",
