    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is a critical vulnerability in the Jenkins core built\u2011in command line interface that enables arbitrary file reading from the Jenkins controller filesystem. Jenkins uses the Args4j command parser with the expandAtFiles feature enabled by default in affected versions. When expandAtFiles is active, any CLI argument beginning with the at\u2011sign followed by a path (for example, @/etc/passwd or @/var/jenkins_home/secrets/master.key) is replaced by the content of that file during argument parsing. Several CLI commands, notably connect-node, can trigger exceptions before the full permission checks occur, resulting in only a minimal read-only verification path being exercised. In many configurations this permits low-privileged or even unauthenticated users who can reach the Jenkins CLI over HTTP to cause the server to read and echo back portions of arbitrary files. The practical impact is reliable leakage of the first lines of text files (often around 19 lines, sometimes more depending on command behavior). Even partial reads of binary or structured files such as master.key, secrets.key, credentials.xml, or operating system files like /etc/passwd can be sufficient to mount follow-on attacks, including decryption of stored credentials and, when chained with additional weaknesses or misconfigurations, achieving remote code execution. The attack requires only network access to the Jenkins controller\u2019s CLI endpoint (for example, by downloading /jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar and invoking CLI commands against the HTTP service). No user interaction is required. Affected versions include Jenkins 2.441 and earlier weekly releases except 2.440.1, and Jenkins Long-Term Support 2.426.2 and earlier. The issue is remediated by disabling expand-at-files in the CLI argument parser in patched versions (2.426.3 LTS, 2.440.1, and 2.442), or by disabling the CLI entirely as a workaround.",
