    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is an expression language injection in Spring Cloud Gateway where untrusted input in route filter/predicate arguments is evaluated as Spring Expression Language (SpEL) via the Actuator \u201cgateway\u201d management endpoint. When that endpoint is enabled, exposed over HTTP, and not protected, a remote attacker can create/modify routes that execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full compromise (confidentiality, integrity, availability). Affected versions: Spring Cloud Gateway 3.0.0\u20133.0.6 and 3.1.0 (older unsupported versions also affected); fixed in 3.0.7+ and 3.1.1+. Listed by CISA KEV and known exploited in the wild.",
