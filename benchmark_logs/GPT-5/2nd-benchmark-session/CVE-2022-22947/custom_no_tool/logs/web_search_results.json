    "desc": "CVE-2022-22947 is a critical vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway that allows remote, unauthenticated code injection when the Gateway Actuator endpoints are enabled, exposed to the network, and left unsecured. Spring Cloud Gateway exposes management endpoints (the \u201cGateway Actuator\u201d endpoints) for dynamic route management and introspection. Vulnerable versions improperly process Spring Expression Language (SpEL) provided through the Actuator routes API. An attacker can submit crafted requests to endpoints such as POST /actuator/gateway/routes/{id} to define or modify a route whose filter arguments embed malicious SpEL expressions. After creating or updating such a route, the attacker can trigger POST /actuator/gateway/refresh to apply the new configuration, which causes the SpEL to be evaluated by the application. Because SpEL in this context can reach classes such as java.lang.Runtime or ProcessBuilder, the evaluation can execute arbitrary operating system commands or arbitrary Java code within the application\u2019s process. Attackers can further retrieve command outputs via subsequent GET requests to the route definition (for example, by abusing response header filters to exfiltrate results) and then clean up with DELETE /actuator/gateway/routes/{id} followed by another refresh. Successful exploitation yields full remote code execution in the context of the Spring Cloud Gateway process on the host. The issue affects Spring Cloud Gateway 3.1.0, 3.0.0 through 3.0.6, and older unsupported lines when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed, and not protected by authentication or authorization. The vulnerability is widely documented, scored with a maximum severity, and has public exploits, including framework modules. Mitigation requires upgrading Spring Cloud Gateway to 3.1.1 or later on the 3.1 line, or 3.0.7 or later on the 3.0 line, and ensuring the Gateway Actuator endpoints are disabled when not needed or secured (for example, via Spring Security) so they are not accessible to unauthenticated users.",
