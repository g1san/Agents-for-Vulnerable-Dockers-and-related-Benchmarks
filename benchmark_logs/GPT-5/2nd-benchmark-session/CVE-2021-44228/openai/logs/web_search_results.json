    "desc": "CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) is a critical remote code execution flaw in Apache Log4j 2\u2019s log4j-core component due to message lookup substitution and JNDI (JndiLookup). When attacker-controlled data is logged using vulnerable Log4j 2 (versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0, excluding backports 2.12.2/2.12.3/2.3.1), crafted strings like ${jndi:ldap://...} can trigger remote lookups and load attacker-supplied code. Impact is broad across Java apps embedding log4j-core and is exploitable without authentication. Later releases (2.16.0+ and noted backports) remove message lookups and disable JNDI by default, fully mitigating this vector.",
