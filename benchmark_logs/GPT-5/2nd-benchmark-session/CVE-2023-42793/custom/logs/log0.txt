 >>> Permission problem: TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH '/data/teamcity_server/datadir' is not a writeable directory
 
     Looks like some mandatory directories are not writable (see above).
     TeamCity container is running under 'tcuser' (1000/1000) user.
 
     A quick workaround: pass '-u 0' parameter to 'docker run' command to start it under 'root' user.
     The proper fix: run 'chown -R 1000:1000' on the corresponding volume(s), this can take noticeable time.
 
     If the problem persists after the permission fix, please check that the corresponding volume(s)
     are not used by stale stopped Docker containers ("docker container prune" command may help).
