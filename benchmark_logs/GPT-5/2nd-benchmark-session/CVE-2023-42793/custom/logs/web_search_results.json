    "desc": "CVE-2023-42793 is a critical flaw in JetBrains TeamCity Server that permits an authentication bypass, enabling complete compromise of the continuous integration and delivery server by anyone who can reach its network interface. The issue resides in the TeamCity Server\u2019s web layer and allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to interact with internal functionality as if they were a trusted or authenticated user. As a result, the attacker can gain administrative capabilities and trigger arbitrary build steps or server-side actions that execute code on the host running TeamCity Server. Because TeamCity orchestrates build agents, scripts, and plugins, a successful bypass can cascade into execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the TeamCity Server process, theft of stored credentials, manipulation of build configurations, and distribution of malicious artifacts. No valid credentials are required; only network access to the TeamCity Server is needed. The vulnerability affects all TeamCity Server versions prior to 2023.05.4 and was remediated in 2023.05.4 by enforcing proper authentication and hardening the affected endpoints. From a deployment perspective, exploitation targets the TeamCity Server service itself and does not require ancillary components beyond a reachable server instance. Impact includes full administrative takeover of the TeamCity application, remote command execution on the server, potential lateral movement through stored secrets or integrations, and integrity compromise of software supply chain outputs. Administrators should upgrade to TeamCity 2023.05.4 or later and restrict network exposure to the management interface.",
