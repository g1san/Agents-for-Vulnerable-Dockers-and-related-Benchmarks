CVE description: CVE-2023-42793 is a critical flaw in JetBrains TeamCity Server (on‑premises) that enables an unauthenticated attacker, with only network access to the TeamCity web interface, to bypass authentication and obtain administrative control of the server. The root cause, as analyzed by SonarSource, is a request interceptor misconfiguration that disables normal pre‑handling (including authentication) for any request path ending in “/RPC2”. TeamCity exposes a REST endpoint at /app/rest/users/{userLocator}/tokens/{name} that lets a caller choose the token name. By selecting the token name “RPC2”, the resulting request path ends with “/RPC2”, which slips past authentication checks. This allows an attacker to create authentication tokens for arbitrary users, including the built‑in administrator, without supplying valid credentials. With administrative access, an attacker can fully operate the TeamCity server through its web interface and REST APIs. Multiple reports further show that once administrative control is obtained, the attacker can leverage built‑in TeamCity functionality (for example, the REST debug/process execution capability) to run arbitrary commands as the TeamCity server user, resulting in remote code execution. Practical impacts include theft of source code and secrets, takeover of build agents, poisoning of build pipelines and artifacts, and installation of persistent backdoors. The issue affects TeamCity Server versions prior to 2023.05.4; TeamCity Cloud is not affected. The vulnerability was discovered in early September 2023 and has been widely exploited in the wild, with guidance from JetBrains, security vendors, and government advisories urging immediate upgrades to version 2023.05.4 or later and restriction of public exposure of the TeamCity web service.
Attack Type: Authentication bypass leading to unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetbrains/teamcity-server][['0---2023.05.3', '2023.05.3']] JetBrains TeamCity Server is the only component required for this vulnerability. A single, publicly reachable TeamCity Server instance (HTTP/HTTPS) running a vulnerable version is sufficient for exploitation; no external database, web server, or additional services are required to trigger the authentication bypass and obtain administrative access.
