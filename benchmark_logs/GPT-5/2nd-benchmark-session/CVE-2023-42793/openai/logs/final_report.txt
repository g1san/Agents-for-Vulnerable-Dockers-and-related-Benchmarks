CVE description: JetBrains TeamCity On‑Premises (self‑hosted CI/CD server) is affected by an authentication bypass in its web layer that allows certain HTTP(S) requests to evade authorization checks. All TeamCity On‑Premises versions earlier than 2023.05.4 are vulnerable; TeamCity Cloud was not affected. The flaw, described as missing authentication for critical functionality, enables unauthenticated network attackers to access sensitive endpoints and ultimately gain administrative control. With admin privileges, attackers can achieve remote code execution on the TeamCity server (e.g., via privileged REST/API functions or by uploading a malicious plugin), leading to full server takeover and supply‑chain impact. The issue was reported by Sonar on 2023‑09‑06; JetBrains released a fix in 2023.05.4 on 2023‑09‑18 and a mitigation plugin for older versions. The CVE has a critical CVSS (9.8) and appears in CISA KEV; widespread exploitation has been observed, including by nation‑state actors.
Attack Type: Authentication bypass enabling remote code execution by an unauthenticated network attacker through TeamCity’s HTTP(S) interface.
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jetbrains/teamcity-server][['2023.05.3', '2023.05.2', '2022.x', '2021.x']] TeamCity Server itself contains the authentication bypass. Running any tag earlier than 2023.05.4 exposes the vulnerable HTTP(S) interface on port 8111; no external DB or reverse proxy is required for a functional, testable vulnerable setup.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE: Container is not starting correctly. It repeatedly runs /run-services.sh -> /services/check-server-volumes.sh and fails with: "Permission problem: TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH '/data/teamcity_server/datadir' is not a writeable directory". The container runs as tcuser (uid/gid 1000) which lacks write permissions on the mounted volume. Fix by adjusting ownership/permissions on the host volume (e.g., chown -R 1000:1000 on the mapped path) or start as root (-u 0) as a workaround; also ensure no stale containers hold the volume.
	- ERROR: TeamCity container repeatedly exits due to insufficient write permissions on the mounted data directory. The container runs as tcuser (uid/gid 1000) but the host bind mounts ./teamcity_data -> /data/teamcity_server/datadir and ./logs -> /opt/teamcity/logs are not writable by uid/gid 1000, triggering the startup check to fail: "Permission problem: TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH '/data/teamcity_server/datadir' is not a writeable directory".
	- FIX: Run the TeamCity container as root to bypass the write-permission check on the bind-mounted host directories. This is achieved by adding user: "0:0" to the teamcity-server service in docker-compose.yml. This ensures immediate deployability with docker compose up without requiring host-side chown of the bind mounts.

Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
