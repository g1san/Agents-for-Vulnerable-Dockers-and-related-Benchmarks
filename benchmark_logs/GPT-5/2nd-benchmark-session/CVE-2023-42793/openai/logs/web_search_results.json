    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 affects Jenkins core\u2019s built-in CLI. Jenkins\u2019 args4j parser allowed @file expansion (e.g., @/path/to/file) when processing CLI arguments, enabling arbitrary file read on the controller using its default charset. Jenkins weekly \u22642.441 and LTS \u22642.426.2 are vulnerable; fixes disable @file expansion in weekly 2.442 and LTS 2.426.3 (and later LTS line 2.440.1). The CLI is reachable via the web UI (including a WebSocket endpoint). Without any permissions, limited file content can be read via certain CLI commands; with Overall/Read, entire files can be disclosed. Exposed secrets can lead to admin takeover and subsequent RCE through normal administrative functionality. NVD classifies this as improper pathname limitation (arbitrary file read) and lists it in CISA KEV; public exploits exist.",
