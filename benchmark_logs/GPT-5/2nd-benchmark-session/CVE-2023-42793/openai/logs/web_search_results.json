    "desc": "JetBrains TeamCity On\u2011Premises (self\u2011hosted CI/CD server) is affected by an authentication bypass in its web layer that allows certain HTTP(S) requests to evade authorization checks. All TeamCity On\u2011Premises versions earlier than 2023.05.4 are vulnerable; TeamCity Cloud was not affected. The flaw, described as missing authentication for critical functionality, enables unauthenticated network attackers to access sensitive endpoints and ultimately gain administrative control. With admin privileges, attackers can achieve remote code execution on the TeamCity server (e.g., via privileged REST/API functions or by uploading a malicious plugin), leading to full server takeover and supply\u2011chain impact. The issue was reported by Sonar on 2023\u201109\u201106; JetBrains released a fix in 2023.05.4 on 2023\u201109\u201118 and a mitigation plugin for older versions. The CVE has a critical CVSS (9.8) and appears in CISA KEV; widespread exploitation has been observed, including by nation\u2011state actors.",
