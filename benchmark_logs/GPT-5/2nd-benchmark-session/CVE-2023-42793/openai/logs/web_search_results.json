    "desc": "JetBrains TeamCity On-Premises before 2023.05.4 contains an authentication bypass via alternate path handling. A wildcard-exempted path ending with \"/RPC2\" allowed requests to skip authorization checks, which could be combined with a hidden REST endpoint for token creation to generate admin tokens without authentication. An attacker with HTTP(S) access to the TeamCity Server could gain administrative control and execute arbitrary code. Fixed in 2023.05.4.",
