    "desc": "CVE-2021-42013 addresses an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. This vulnerability allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks, enabling access to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default configuration \"require all denied,\" unauthorized access can occur. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled in these paths, remote code execution is possible. This issue affects only Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 and 2.4.50.",
