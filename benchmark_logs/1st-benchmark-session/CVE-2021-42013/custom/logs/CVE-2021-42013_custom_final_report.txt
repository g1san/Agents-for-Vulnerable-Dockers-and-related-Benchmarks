3. The 'httpd' version used is 2.4.49, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The Docker container is not running due to a missing or incorrect base image specification for the 'debian' service. Additionally, the 'httpd' service is using a vulnerable version (2.4.49) which is known to have security issues.
	Fix: 1. Add a 'debian' service to the Docker Compose file using the 'bullseye' version as the base image to ensure the presence of the required OS base.
2. Upgrade the 'httpd' service to version 2.4.50 to mitigate the known vulnerabilities associated with version 2.4.49.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker system does not run correctly because the container running the 'httpd' service is not running. According to the logs, the status of the 'httpd' container is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating it did not start properly. The services used are 'httpd' and 'debian', which match the required services. The 'httpd' version used is 2.4.50, which falls within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The 'httpd' service container exited with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file, specifically the 'Require all denied' directive in the root directory configuration, which prevents the server from starting correctly.
	Fix: Modify the 'httpd.conf' file to allow access to the server root by changing 'Require all denied' to 'Require all granted'. This will ensure the server starts correctly by allowing access to the necessary directories.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start. The logs show that the 'debian' container is running, and both 'httpd' and 'debian' services are present. The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The 'httpd' container is exiting with code 1 due to a misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file. The error is likely related to the configuration of directories or required modules.
	Fix: The issue can be resolved by ensuring that all necessary modules are loaded and directory permissions are correctly configured. Additionally, verify that the 'httpd.conf' file is correctly formatted and does not contain errors that could prevent the Apache server from starting.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container for the 'httpd' service is not running correctly. The logs show that the container with the 'httpd' service has a status of 'exited' and is not running, with an exit code of 1. This indicates a failure in the service startup. The 'debian' service is running correctly, and the 'httpd' service uses version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The Docker container for the 'httpd' service exits with code 1, indicating a startup failure. This is typically due to configuration issues in the 'httpd.conf' file, missing modules, or incorrect permissions.
	Fix: The issue was fixed by ensuring that the configuration in 'httpd.conf' is correct and compatible with the Apache version. Specifically, the 'Require all denied' directive was moved to a more appropriate context to avoid denying access to essential directories. Additionally, the 'Listen' directive was adjusted to ensure the server binds to the correct port. Furthermore, ensured that the necessary modules are loaded and configurations are correctly set to avoid conflicts.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker container for the 'httpd' service is not running correctly. The container's state shows 'Status': 'exited' and 'ExitCode': 1, indicating it has exited with an error. This prevents the Docker system from running correctly, even though it uses the specified services and the 'httpd' version is within the required range (2.4.50).
	Error: The Docker container for the 'httpd' service is not starting due to a configuration issue in the 'httpd.conf' file. The 'Require all denied' directive for the root directory '/' is too restrictive and prevents the server from starting properly. Additionally, there might be an issue with the permissions for the CGI script 'test.sh', which needs to be executable by the Apache user.
	Fix: To fix the issue, adjust the 'httpd.conf' file to allow access to necessary directories by setting 'Require all granted' for the root directory. Additionally, ensure that the CGI script has the correct permissions and is executable by the Apache server. Also, verify that all necessary modules are correctly loaded and configured.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running Correctly: The 'httpd' service container is not running correctly. The logs show that the 'httpd' container has exited with an ExitCode of 1, indicating an error during startup.
2. Services Used: The logs confirm that the Docker is using both 'debian' and 'httpd' services.
3. Version of 'httpd': The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The error is due to the use of a vulnerable version of Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.4.50, which has known security vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-42013. This version can lead to path traversal and potential remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.
	Fix: The fix involves updating the Dockerfile to use a secure configuration for the Apache HTTP Server. Since we must use the specified vulnerable version, we will mitigate the issue by configuring the Apache server to minimize risk. This includes ensuring secure directory permissions and disabling unnecessary modules that could be exploited.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the 'httpd' container has exited with an ExitCode of 1, indicating an error during startup. The services 'httpd' and 'debian' are correctly identified in the logs. The 'httpd' service is using version 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The 'httpd' container exits with code 1 due to a potential misconfiguration in the 'httpd.conf' file or issues with the Apache server startup process. This can be caused by incorrect module loading, directory permissions, or other configuration errors.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure the 'httpd.conf' file is correctly configured by checking the syntax and compatibility with Apache version 2.4.50. Additionally, verify that all necessary modules are loaded and directory permissions are correctly set. Specifically, ensure that the 'Require all granted' directive is correctly applied to directories that need access. Also, ensure that the CGI script has the correct permissions and is executable by the Apache server.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Error: The error 'yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context' indicates a syntax error in the YAML file, likely due to incorrect indentation or formatting issues.
	Fix: The error is fixed by correcting the indentation and formatting in the 'docker-compose.yml' file to ensure it adheres to YAML syntax rules. Specifically, ensuring no extra spaces or incorrect line breaks are present.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running Correctly: The Docker container with the ID '27b0d97ee5ee945e667dc55a63751b88b87164603d55668d45a4e97c485b844f' is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' field, which shows 'Status': 'exited' and 'ExitCode': 1. This suggests that the container failed to start or crashed shortly after starting.

2. Services Used: The logs indicate that the services 'httpd' and 'debian' are present. The 'debian' service is running in the container with ID '817493c11593600e7d481f577c931a7de8d73538c3d4eec52421f277bbcbef52', and the 'httpd' service is configured in the container with ID '27b0d97ee5ee945e667dc55a63751b88b87164603d55668d45a4e97c485b844f'.

3. Version of 'httpd': The 'httpd' version used in the container is '2.4.50', which falls within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The container running the 'httpd' service exits with code 1, which typically indicates a configuration or runtime error. Given the specified version 2.4.50 of 'httpd', it is vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013, which involves a path traversal issue that can lead to remote code execution if not properly mitigated. The previous fixes attempted to address configuration issues but did not resolve the exit problem.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the Apache server can start without encountering the vulnerabilities of CVE-2021-42013. Since we cannot upgrade beyond version 2.4.50, we will mitigate the risk by adjusting the configuration to prevent exploitation. This involves ensuring that directory permissions are securely configured and that unnecessary modules are not loaded. Additionally, verify that the CGI script is executable and that the server's main configuration is correct.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as indicated by the 'State' section where 'Running' is False and 'Status' is 'exited'.
2. The logs only show the presence of the 'httpd' service. There is no evidence of the 'debian' service being used.
3. The version of 'httpd' used is 2.4.50, which is within the specified range of 2.4.49---2.4.50.
	Error: The Docker container is not running correctly because the 'httpd' service version 2.4.50 is vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013, which allows path traversal and potential RCE. Additionally, the configuration may not be correctly set to mitigate this vulnerability.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we will use a multi-stage build in the Dockerfile to ensure a more secure setup, even while using the vulnerable version. We'll also adjust the 'httpd.conf' to minimize exposure by removing unnecessary modules and ensuring directory permissions are secure. The CGI script will be checked for correct permissions and execution capability.
