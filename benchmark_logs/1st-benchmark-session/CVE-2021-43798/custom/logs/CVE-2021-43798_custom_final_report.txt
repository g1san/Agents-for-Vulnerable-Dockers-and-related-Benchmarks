Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not all running correctly. The Nginx container has exited with a status of 'exited' and an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start.
2. The services used include 'grafana', 'mysql', and 'nginx', which match the required services.
3. The version of the 'grafana/grafana' service cannot be verified from the logs. The image used is 'custom-grafana', which does not specify a version number. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm if it falls within the specified range of 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0.
	Error: The Nginx container is exiting with code 1, indicating a failure to start. This could be due to an incorrect configuration in the nginx.conf file or an issue with the Docker setup.
	Fix: 1. Ensure that the nginx.conf file is correctly configured and that the file path is correct in the docker-compose.yml file.
2. Verify that the Grafana service is properly set up and running, as Nginx is acting as a reverse proxy to Grafana.
3. Use a specific version for the Grafana image in the Dockerfile to match the allowed version range.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Containers Running Correctly: The NGINX container is not running correctly. Its state shows 'Status': 'exited', with 'ExitCode': 1, indicating an error during startup.
2. Services Check: The logs show that the services 'grafana/grafana', 'mysql', and 'nginx' are present. However, the NGINX service is not running.
3. Grafana Version Check: The logs do not specify the exact version of Grafana being used. It only mentions 'custom-grafana'. Without explicit version information, it is not possible to confirm if the Grafana version falls within the specified range (8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0).
	Error: The NGINX container is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates a configuration or runtime error. The logs suggest that the NGINX service is not running, potentially due to misconfiguration in the NGINX configuration file, or issues with the Grafana service it's trying to proxy to.
	Fix: 1. Ensure the NGINX configuration is correct and the path to the Grafana service is accessible.
2. Set a specific version for the Grafana image within the allowed range.
3. Ensure all necessary environment variables and dependencies are correctly set up and available.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: The Nginx container is not running correctly. Its status is 'exited' with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during startup.

2. Code Main Version: The Grafana container does not specify a version number, making it impossible to verify if it is within the specified range of 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0. The image is labeled 'custom-grafana', which does not provide version information.
	Error: The Nginx container exits with code 1 due to a possible misconfiguration in the nginx.conf file or the Grafana service not being accessible. The Grafana container lacks a specific version, making it difficult to ensure compatibility.
	Fix: 1. Update the Docker Compose file to ensure that the Grafana service uses a specific image version within the allowed range.
2. Verify the Nginx configuration to ensure it correctly proxies requests to the Grafana service.
3. Ensure that the Grafana service starts correctly and is accessible by the Nginx service.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not running correctly because the nginx container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating an error during its startup process. This suggests that there is an issue with the nginx configuration or setup that needs to be resolved.

The services provided by the web search ('grafana/grafana', 'mysql', 'nginx') are all present in the logs.

The version of 'grafana/grafana' used is 8.3.0, which is within the specified range of 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0.
	Error: The nginx container exits with code 1 due to an error in its configuration or setup. This typically indicates a problem with the nginx.conf file or the way nginx is trying to connect to the Grafana service.
	Fix: The issue is likely due to nginx being unable to resolve the Grafana service name or connect to it properly. We will ensure that the Grafana service is correctly set up and accessible by nginx. Additionally, we will verify that the nginx configuration is correct and that the path to the Grafana service is accessible. We will also adjust the docker-compose file to ensure proper network configuration and dependencies.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with a non-zero exit code (ExitCode: 1), indicating that it failed to start properly. 

The services 'grafana/grafana', 'mysql', and 'nginx' are all present in the logs, which satisfies the second goal.

The 'grafana/grafana' service is running version 8.3.0, which falls within the specified version range of 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0, satisfying the third goal.
	Error: The 'nginx' container is exiting with a non-zero exit code because it is unable to resolve the hostname 'grafana' due to missing network configuration or incorrect Docker Compose setup. This prevents Nginx from properly proxying requests to the Grafana service.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that all services are on the same Docker network to allow service name resolution. Also, verify that the Grafana service is properly running and accessible by Nginx. The Docker Compose file should explicitly define the network for all services and ensure that Nginx waits for Grafana to be ready using the 'depends_on' condition.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The Docker Compose setup is failing because the Grafana container does not have a healthcheck configured. As a result, Docker Compose cannot determine if the Grafana service is healthy, leading to a dependency failure for the Nginx service which relies on Grafana being healthy.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to configure a healthcheck for the Grafana service in the Docker Compose file. This will allow Docker Compose to verify that Grafana is running correctly before proceeding with starting dependent services like Nginx.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The logs indicate that the Grafana container is marked as unhealthy, which is causing the dependent services to fail to start properly. This is likely due to the health check command failing to verify the Grafana service's availability. The health check is using a simple curl command to check if the Grafana service is up and running on port 3000, but it might not be sufficient or correct.
	Fix: To address the issue, the health check command for the Grafana service should be modified to ensure it accurately verifies the service's health. Additionally, ensure that the Grafana service has sufficient time to start up before the health check is performed. This can be achieved by adjusting the start period of the health check. Also, ensure that the Grafana service is correctly configured to start with the necessary environment variables and dependencies.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the Grafana container is marked as unhealthy, which is causing dependent services to fail. This can be due to an incorrect health check configuration that does not accurately reflect the service's healthy state.
	Fix: To fix the problem, the health check for the Grafana service should be adjusted to ensure it accurately verifies the service's health. Additionally, ensure that the Grafana service has sufficient time to start up before the health check is performed. This can be achieved by adjusting the start period of the health check and ensuring that the Grafana service is correctly configured to start with the necessary environment variables and dependencies.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the Grafana container is marked as unhealthy, which causes the dependency (Nginx) to fail to start. This suggests that the health check for the Grafana service is not passing, potentially due to Grafana taking longer to start up than expected or an issue with the health check command itself.
	Fix: To address the issue, we will modify the health check for the Grafana service to ensure it accurately verifies the service's health. We will increase the `start_period` to give Grafana more time to initialize before the health check begins. Additionally, we will ensure that the health check command is correct and that all necessary dependencies and configurations are in place for Grafana to start successfully.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Error: The logs indicate that the Grafana container is marked as unhealthy. This is likely due to the health check failing, which is set to check the Grafana health endpoint.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we will ensure the health check is correctly configured and that Grafana has enough time to start up. We'll also increase the `start_period` further to allow more time for Grafana to initialize, as the current 90 seconds might still be insufficient. Additionally, we will verify that the health check URL is correct and accessible from within the container network.
