Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start. The other containers ('grafana' and 'mysql') are running correctly. All required services are present, and the 'grafana/grafana' service is using version 8.3.0, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The 'nginx' container is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates a configuration issue. The error is likely due to the 'nginx.conf' file not being correctly configured or the 'nginx' service not being able to connect to the 'grafana' service.
	Fix: The issue was fixed by ensuring that the 'nginx' service can correctly resolve and connect to the 'grafana' service. This was done by adding a 'depends_on' directive to ensure that 'nginx' starts after 'grafana'. Additionally, the 'nginx.conf' file was checked to ensure it correctly proxies requests to the 'grafana' service.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start. The other containers ('grafana' and 'mysql') are running correctly. All required services are present, and the 'grafana/grafana' service is using version 8.3.0, which is within the specified range.
	Error: The 'nginx' container is exiting with code 1, which typically indicates a configuration issue. The 'nginx.conf' file is set to proxy requests to 'grafana:3000', but the 'grafana' service is exposed on port 3000 on the host, not within the Docker network. The 'nginx' service should proxy to 'grafana:3000' within the Docker network, which is correct. However, the issue might be related to the 'nginx.conf' file not being correctly mounted or having incorrect permissions.
	Fix: The fix involves ensuring that the 'nginx.conf' file is correctly mounted and accessible by the 'nginx' container. Additionally, verify that the 'nginx.conf' file has the correct syntax and permissions. The 'nginx.conf' file should be readable by the 'nginx' process inside the container. Also, ensure that the 'nginx' service is correctly configured to start and that the file paths are correct.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start.

	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the 'nginx.conf' file is correctly mounted and accessible by the 'nginx' container. Additionally, verify that the 'nginx.conf' file has the correct syntax and permissions. The 'nginx.conf' file should be readable by the 'nginx' process inside the container. Also, ensure that the 'nginx' service is correctly configured to start and that the file paths are correct. In this case, the 'nginx.conf' file is mounted as read-only, which is correct, but we should ensure the file exists and is correctly formatted. Additionally, ensure that the 'nginx' service is correctly configured to start and that the file paths are correct.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start. The other two containers, 'grafana/grafana' and 'mysql', are running correctly.
