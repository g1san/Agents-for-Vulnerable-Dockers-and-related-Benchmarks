Test iteration #0 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker containers are not all running correctly. The 'nginx' container has exited with a non-zero exit code (1), indicating an issue during startup or execution. 

2. The services are correctly identified as 'cacti', 'mysql', and 'nginx'. However, the 'nginx' service is not running due to the mentioned issue.

3. The 'cacti' service is running with a custom image, but there is no explicit version information provided in the logs. Without explicit version information, we cannot confirm if it matches version 1.2.22.
	Error: The 'nginx' container exits with a non-zero exit code because it cannot connect to the 'cacti' service. This is likely due to the 'nginx' service starting before 'cacti' is fully up and running, or due to incorrect proxy settings in the 'nginx.conf'.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the 'nginx' service waits for the 'cacti' service to be fully ready before starting. Additionally, verify that the 'nginx.conf' correctly proxies requests to the 'cacti' service.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker containers are not all running correctly because the 'nginx' container has exited with an exit code of 1, indicating a failure to start.
2. The services 'cacti', 'mysql', and 'nginx' are present, fulfilling the services requirement.
3. The 'cacti' service is running, but the logs do not specify the version of 'cacti' being used. However, based on the available information, it appears to match the required version 1.2.22.
	Error: The 'nginx' container fails to start because it cannot connect to the 'cacti' service, as indicated by the exit code 1. This is due to the 'cacti' service not being fully ready when 'nginx' attempts to connect to it. The 'nginx' service uses a command to wait for 'cacti' to be available, but it checks for port 80 on the 'cacti' service, which is not exposed by the 'cacti' service in the Docker configuration.
	Fix: The fix involves ensuring that the 'cacti' service exposes port 80 to allow the 'nginx' service to connect to it. This is done by adding the appropriate port mapping to the 'cacti' service in the Docker Compose file. Additionally, the 'nginx' service should correctly wait for the 'cacti' service to be ready on the specified port.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. Docker Runs: The nginx container is not running as indicated by its status 'exited' with an ExitCode of 1. This suggests a failure to start properly.
2. Services Ok: The logs show containers for 'cacti', 'mysql', and 'nginx', which matches the required services.
3. Code Main Version: The logs do not provide specific version information for 'cacti'. The 'Image' field for the 'cacti' container shows 'custom-cacti', but it does not specify a version number, so it's unclear if it matches 1.2.22.
	Error: The nginx container is exiting with code 1, which indicates a failure to start. The logs suggest that the nginx service is not able to connect to the cacti service because the cacti service is not fully ready or there's a configuration issue preventing nginx from connecting properly.
	Fix: 1. Ensure that the cacti service is correctly exposing port 80 and is fully ready before nginx attempts to connect. This involves checking the cacti Dockerfile and ensuring the Apache server is properly configured and running.
2. Modify the Dockerfile for the cacti service to ensure Apache is started correctly and that the necessary ports are exposed.
3. Adjust the nginx startup command to include a more robust wait-for-it script to ensure the cacti service is fully ready before nginx starts.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the Docker build process is failing due to the absence of the 'wait-for-it.sh' script in the specified path. The Dockerfile for the nginx service attempts to copy this script, but it cannot find it, leading to a failure in the build process.
	Fix: To resolve this issue, ensure that the 'wait-for-it.sh' script is present in the 'nginx' directory. This script should be available in the context of the Docker build so that it can be successfully copied into the image. Additionally, remove the obsolete 'version' attribute from the 'docker-compose.yml' to avoid confusion.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Error: The error indicates that the Docker build process is failing because the file 'wait-for-it.sh' is not found in the expected location during the build of the Nginx image. This is causing the checksum calculation to fail, leading to the termination of the build process.
	Fix: To fix this issue, ensure that the 'wait-for-it.sh' script is present in the 'custom/nginx' directory so that it can be successfully copied into the Docker image. Additionally, remove the obsolete 'version' attribute from the 'docker-compose.yml' file as suggested in the warning message.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Dockerfile for the nginx service attempts to copy a file 'wait-for-it.sh' that does not exist in the specified path. The Docker build process cannot find this file, leading to the failure.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, ensure that the 'wait-for-it.sh' script is present in the 'custom/nginx' directory. This script must be available in the context of the Docker build so that it can be successfully copied into the image. Additionally, remove the obsolete 'version' attribute from the 'docker-compose.yml' to avoid confusion.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Dockerfile tries to copy 'wait-for-it.sh' into the image, but the file is not found in the specified path. This results in a failed build for the nginx service.
	Fix: To fix this issue, ensure that the 'wait-for-it.sh' script is actually present in the 'custom/nginx' directory before building the Docker image. This will allow the script to be successfully copied into the Docker image during the build process.========== Test Passed! Generated Code (Final Version) ==========
