Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the Debian 10 (Buster) repositories being moved or removed, resulting in a 404 Not Found error when attempting to access them. This causes the apt-get update command to fail, preventing the installation of the specified version of OpenSMTPD.
	Fix: To fix the issue, update the Dockerfile to use Debian 11 (Bullseye) instead of Debian 10 (Buster) since the latter's repositories are no longer available. This will allow apt-get update to successfully access the package repositories and install the desired package.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the specified version '6.6.4p1-1' of the 'opensmtpd' package is not found in the Debian Bullseye repositories. This is causing the Docker build process to fail with an exit code of 100.
	Fix: To resolve this issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install a version of 'opensmtpd' that is available in the Debian Bullseye repositories. Since the requirement specifies using version '6.6', we can install the latest available version in the Bullseye repositories that matches this constraint. Additionally, the 'version' attribute in the 'docker-compose.yml' file is obsolete, so it should be removed to avoid confusion.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. **Docker Containers Running Correctly**: The container's state indicates that it is not running. The `State` section shows `"Status": "exited"` and `"Running": false`, with an `ExitCode` of 1, suggesting the container failed to start or crashed shortly after starting.

2. **Services Provided**: The container is using the service `opensmtpd`, as indicated by the `Path` (`/usr/sbin/smtpd`) and the `com.docker.compose.service` label (`opensmtpd`).

3. **Version of 'opensmtpd'**: The logs do not provide explicit versioning information for `opensmtpd`. However, the presence of `com.docker.compose.project.config_files` and the context suggests it is likely using a version relevant to CVE-2020-7247, which is within the specified version range (6.6). Without explicit version information, the assumption is based on the context provided.
	Error: The error is likely due to the OpenSMTPD service crashing because of a misconfiguration or an issue with the version of the service being used. The exit code of 1 indicates a failure in the service's startup process.
	Fix: To fix the issue, ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and that the service is compatible with the installed version. Additionally, ensure that the correct version of OpenSMTPD is installed and that the configuration file is properly formatted and placed.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version '6.6.4p1-1' of the 'opensmtpd' package is not available in the Debian 11 (Bullseye) repositories. This results in the Docker build process failing with an exit code 100, indicating that the package manager could not find the specified version of the package.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install the latest available version of 'opensmtpd' in the Debian Bullseye repositories that matches the '6.6' version constraint. We will remove the specific version number from the 'apt-get install' command, allowing it to install the latest version of 'opensmtpd' that matches the '6.6' major version. This will ensure compatibility with the available packages in the repository.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Fail Explanation: The logs provided are empty, which means there is no information to determine if the Docker containers are running correctly, if the 'opensmtpd' service is being used, or if the correct version of 'opensmtpd' is implemented. Without any data, these assessments cannot be made.
	Error: The Docker setup fails because the 'opensmtpd' service version specified as '6.6' is not directly available in the Debian 11 repository, which causes the service to not start correctly. Additionally, the configuration file might not be compatible with the installed version of 'opensmtpd'.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we will explicitly download and build 'opensmtpd' version 6.6 from source, ensuring compatibility with the specified version requirement. This involves adding steps in the Dockerfile to download the source code of 'opensmtpd' version 6.6, compile it, and install it. Additionally, we will verify the configuration file for compatibility with version 6.6.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified version of OpenSMTPD (6.6.0p1) is not available at the given URL, resulting in a 404 Not Found error during the wget command execution.
	Fix: To fix this, we need to find a valid source for OpenSMTPD version 6.6. Since the error indicates that the specific version is not available at the provided URL, we should switch to downloading from the official OpenSMTPD GitHub repository, where the source code for version 6.6 can be found. We will update the Dockerfile to clone the repository and checkout the correct version tag to build OpenSMTPD from source.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified Git tag 'opensmtpd-6.6.0p1' does not exist in the OpenSMTPD Git repository. This results in a failure during the 'git checkout' command.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to identify the correct tag or commit hash for OpenSMTPD version 6.6.0p1. If the specific tag does not exist, we should find a commit that corresponds to version 6.6, or alternatively, use a different version that matches the '6.6' requirement. We can modify the Dockerfile to use a commit hash if necessary.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the specified commit hash '6a7d9e1' does not exist in the OpenSMTPD repository. This results in a failure when attempting to checkout that specific commit.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, we need to identify the correct commit hash or tag that corresponds to OpenSMTPD version 6.6 in the repository. If this specific version is not tagged, we should find a commit that aligns with the 6.6 version. Alternatively, we can use a different method to obtain version 6.6, such as downloading a release archive if available.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the build process failed because the 'automake' version required for building OpenSMTPD (1.14 or later) is not installed in the Docker image.
	Fix: To fix the issue, we need to modify the Dockerfile to install 'automake' before trying to build OpenSMTPD. This will ensure that the required version of 'automake' is available during the build process.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the build process for OpenSMTPD is failing because the 'libtool' package is missing. The './bootstrap' script requires 'libtool' to be installed in order to proceed with the build process. Without 'libtool', the script cannot complete, resulting in the termination of the build process with an error.
	Fix: To fix the error, the Dockerfile needs to be updated to include the installation of the 'libtool' package. This can be done by adding 'libtool' to the list of packages installed by the 'apt-get install' command in the Dockerfile. This ensures that all necessary build dependencies are available before attempting to build OpenSMTPD.
