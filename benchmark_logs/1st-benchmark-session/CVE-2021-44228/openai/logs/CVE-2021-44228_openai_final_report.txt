Test iteration #0 failed!
	Error: The Docker build process fails because the Debian Stretch repositories have been archived and are no longer available at the specified URLs, resulting in 404 errors when attempting to update the package lists.
	Fix: To resolve the issue, the Dockerfile should be updated to use a different base image that is still supported and has active repositories. Since the specific version of OpenJDK (8u181-jre) is required, we need to find an alternative that still provides this version of Java. Alternatively, we can switch to a more recent Debian-based image or another distribution that supports OpenJDK 8u181 and has active package repositories.
Test iteration #1 failed!
	Error: The error in the Docker system is due to the base image 'adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:jre8u181-b13-debian' not being found in the Docker registry. This indicates that the image might have been removed or renamed.
	Fix: To fix this issue, we need to replace the unavailable Docker image with an equivalent one that is available in the Docker registry. We will use the 'openjdk:8u181-jre' image, which matches the required Java version and is available in the official OpenJDK repository. This change ensures compatibility with the specified Java version and allows the Docker system to build successfully.
Test iteration #2 failed!
	Error: The error is caused by the use of outdated Debian Stretch repositories in the Dockerfile, which are no longer available, leading to 404 errors when attempting to update and install packages.
	Fix: To fix the error, we should update the Dockerfile to use a different base image that still supports OpenJDK 8u181 and has active package repositories. One approach is to use an Alpine-based image, which is lightweight and often has longer support for older software versions. We will use the 'openjdk:8u181-jre-alpine' image to ensure compatibility with the specified Java version and allow the Docker system to build successfully.
Test iteration #3 failed!
	Error: The error in the logs indicates that the Maven build process is failing because it cannot find the artifact 'org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-logging-log4j:jar:9.0.54' in the Maven Central repository. This is causing the Docker build to fail as the Maven build step cannot complete successfully.
	Fix: The fix involves removing the dependency on 'tomcat-embed-logging-log4j' from the 'pom.xml' file since it appears to be unavailable in the specified version. This dependency is not needed for the basic functionality of the application as the logging is handled by Log4j directly. Additionally, ensure that the 'src/main/webapp' directory is correctly copied into the Docker image to prevent runtime errors when starting Tomcat.
Test iteration #4 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the Dockerfile trying to copy a directory 'src/main/webapp' that does not exist in the build context. This results in a failure to calculate the checksum for that directory, causing the build process to terminate.
	Fix: To fix this issue, ensure that the 'src/main/webapp' directory exists in the build context. If this directory is not needed, remove the COPY command for it in the Dockerfile. Additionally, update the docker-compose.yml file to remove the obsolete 'version' attribute.
Test iteration #5 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the Dockerfile is using a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) base image, which does not include the Java compiler (javac) required by Maven to compile Java source code. This results in the error message: "No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?"
	Fix: To resolve the issue, the Dockerfile should be modified to use a JDK (Java Development Kit) base image instead of a JRE. The JDK includes the Java compiler, which is necessary for building Java applications using Maven. The fixed Dockerfile uses the 'openjdk:8u181-jdk-alpine' image, which contains the required Java compiler.
Test iteration #6 failed!
	Error: The error occurs because the `mvn clean package` command generates a JAR file named `vulnerable-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` instead of `vulnerable-app.jar`. The `mv` command then fails because it tries to move a non-existent file `target/vulnerable-app.jar`.
	Fix: To fix the error, update the `mv` command in the Dockerfile to use the correct JAR file name `target/vulnerable-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. This ensures that the file is correctly moved to the `/app` directory.
Test iteration #7 failed!
	Fail Explanation: 1. The Docker container is not running correctly as the 'State' indicates 'Status': 'exited' and 'Running': False with an 'ExitCode' of 1, which typically signifies an error during execution.

2. The logs do not provide any indication that the required services ('openjdk', 'log4j', 'tomcat') are present. The environment variables show 'openjdk' but no information about 'log4j' or 'tomcat'.

3. There is no information in the logs about the version of 'log4j' being used, so it's not possible to verify if it includes the specified version 2.14.1.
	Error: The Docker container fails to start due to missing dependencies and incorrect directory paths. The 'State' indicates 'exited' with an 'ExitCode' of 1, suggesting an error in execution. The logs lack information about 'log4j' and 'tomcat', and the application fails to start the embedded Tomcat server due to incorrect paths and missing dependencies.
	Fix: To fix the issues, the following changes are made: 1. Use the 'openjdk:8u181-jre' image to match the required Java Runtime Environment. 2. Ensure that the 'log4j' and 'tomcat' dependencies are correctly specified in 'pom.xml'. 3. Correct the directory path in the Dockerfile and Java application to reflect the actual structure, ensuring that the application can find the necessary resources. 4. Add a 'log4j2.xml' configuration file to the resources directory to configure logging properly. 5. Ensure the application builds and runs with the specified versions of dependencies.
Test iteration #8 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the use of the 'apk' package manager command in the Dockerfile, which is specific to Alpine Linux. However, the base image 'openjdk:8u181-jre' is not an Alpine-based image, hence it does not have 'apk' installed. This results in the '/bin/sh: 1: apk: not found' error.
	Fix: To fix this, we need to use the 'apt-get' package manager, which is compatible with the Debian-based 'openjdk:8u181-jre' image. This involves replacing 'apk' commands with 'apt-get' commands in the Dockerfile.
Test iteration #9 failed!
	Error: The error is due to the use of Debian Stretch repositories which are no longer available. The '404 Not Found' errors indicate that the Debian Stretch repositories have been archived or removed, preventing the 'apt-get update' command from fetching package lists.
	Fix: To resolve this issue, we should switch to using the Debian Buster repositories, which are still available and supported. This involves updating the base image to a newer version that supports OpenJDK 8u181 and has active repositories. Since we need to maintain the specific Java version, we can switch to a different Debian version that still supports this version of OpenJDK.
