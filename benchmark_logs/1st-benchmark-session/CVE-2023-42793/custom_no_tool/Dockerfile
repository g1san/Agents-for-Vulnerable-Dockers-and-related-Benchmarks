# This Dockerfile is intentionally left minimal as the focus is on the
# vulnerable TeamCity server setup in the docker-compose.yml

# Using OpenJDK image as specified in the constraints
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# No additional configurations or applications are needed for this setup
# as the vulnerability lies within the TeamCity server itself
