- ***"get_docker_services"***
    - (***DONE***) Improve it by making the LLM associate a specific tag to the **main service**, i.e., the service that is vulnerable to the CVE.
    - (***DONE***) Add **auxiliary** tag to services added just to make the main service work or to make the docker work
    - (***DONE***) Add manual retrieval of CVE data from NIST website for _custom_web_search_ because of error 502
    - Check if order of URL provided by Google API is the same every time
    - Benchmark how many URLs does the LLM need to check for a given CVE to get the GT services
- ***"assess_docker_services"***
    - (***DONE***) Improve it by having the LLM check if the **main service** version is a vulnerable one
    - If assessment is OK, save the result locally in order to improve GT database
- ***"save_code"***
    - The whole node functionality needs to be assessed
    - Implemented only partially, *keep coding*
- ***"test_docker_code"***
    - Make it work with WSL
    - Generate commands needed to launch and dispose of Docker
    - Retrieve and report back eventual errors from the terminal
    - Evaluate the errors and provide feedback to ***generate_docker_code***
    - Assess if it works correctly using the Dockers from VDaaS
