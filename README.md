# Agents for Vulnerable Dockers and related Benchmarkss
This thesis project focuses on the creation of an autonomous agent that is capable of understanding CVE description and create from its interpretation a vulnerable Docker container, which can then be used to gather attack patterns data. The Docker creation process is benchmarked in order to understand how well the agent is performing its tasks.
