    "desc": "CVE-2020-11652 is a vulnerability in SaltStack Salt, a configuration management tool. It affects Salt versions before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the Salt Master, enabling attackers to read and write arbitrary files on the server. This is due to improper validation of user input in the salt-master process's ClearFuncs class, which permits access to certain methods that do not properly sanitize paths. This flaw allows authenticated users to access arbitrary directories, posing significant security risks by allowing remote code execution and unauthorized file access.",
