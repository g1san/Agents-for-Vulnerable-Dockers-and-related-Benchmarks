    "desc": "CVE-2021-41773 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 due to a flaw in path normalization. This flaw allows attackers to perform a path traversal attack, enabling them to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If these files are not protected by the default \"require all denied\" configuration, the requests can succeed. Additionally, if CGI scripts are enabled for these paths, it could lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild and only affects version 2.4.49, not earlier versions. The fix in version 2.4.50 was incomplete, leading to CVE-2021-42013.",
