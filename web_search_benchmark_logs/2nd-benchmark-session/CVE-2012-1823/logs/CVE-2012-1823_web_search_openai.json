    "desc": "CVE-2012-1823 is a vulnerability in PHP's CGI implementation (php-cgi) that affects versions before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2. When PHP is configured to run as a CGI script, it improperly handles query strings lacking an equals sign (`=`). This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by injecting command-line options into the query string.",
