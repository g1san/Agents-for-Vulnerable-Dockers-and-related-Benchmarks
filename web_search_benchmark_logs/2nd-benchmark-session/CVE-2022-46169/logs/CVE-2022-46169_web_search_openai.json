    "desc": "CVE-2022-46169 is a critical command injection vulnerability in Cacti, an open-source network monitoring and graphing solution. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code on servers running affected versions of Cacti. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file, which can be accessed without authentication. By manipulating HTTP headers, an attacker can bypass authorization checks and exploit the `poll_for_data` function to execute arbitrary commands. The affected versions are all Cacti installations up to and including version 1.2.22.",
