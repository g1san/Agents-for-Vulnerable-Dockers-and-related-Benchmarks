    "desc": "CVE-2018-12613 is a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin versions 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, where an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The issue arises from improper testing for whitelisted pages during page redirection and loading within phpMyAdmin. An attacker must be authenticated, except in cases where `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']` is set to `true` (allowing the attacker to specify any host they control and execute arbitrary code) or `$cfg['ServerDefault']` is set to `0` (bypassing the login requirement and running the vulnerable code without authentication).",
