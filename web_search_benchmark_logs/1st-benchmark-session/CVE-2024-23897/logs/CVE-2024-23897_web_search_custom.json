{
    "desc": "CVE-2024-23897 is an arbitrary file read vulnerability in Jenkins, affecting versions 2.441 and earlier, and LTS 2.426.2 and earlier. The vulnerability arises from Jenkins using the args4j library to parse command arguments, which includes a feature that replaces an '@' character followed by a file path with the file's contents. This feature, enabled by default, allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to read entire files on the Jenkins controller file system. Attackers without this permission can still read the first few lines of files, with the number of lines dependent on available CLI commands.",
