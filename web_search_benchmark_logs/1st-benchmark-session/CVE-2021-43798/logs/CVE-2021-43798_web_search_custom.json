    "desc": "CVE-2021-43798 is a path traversal vulnerability in Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access sensitive files on the server by exploiting the public API endpoint `/public/plugins/:pluginId`, which fails to properly sanitize user-provided file paths. This can lead to unauthorized data access and potential system compromise. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 7, 2021, and has a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating a high risk. Affected installations should be upgraded to patched versions 8.3.1, 8.2.7, 8.1.8, or 8.0.7.",
