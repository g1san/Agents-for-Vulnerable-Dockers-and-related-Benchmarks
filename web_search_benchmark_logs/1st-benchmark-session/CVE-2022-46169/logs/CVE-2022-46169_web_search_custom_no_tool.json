    "desc": "CVE-2022-46169 is a critical command injection vulnerability in Cacti, an open-source network monitoring solution. It affects versions up to 1.2.22, allowing unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of query arguments in the `remote_agent.php` file, which can be accessed without authentication. This allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands by exploiting the `poll_for_data` function, which uses `proc_open` to execute PHP scripts. The issue is patched in versions 1.2.23 and 1.3.0.",
