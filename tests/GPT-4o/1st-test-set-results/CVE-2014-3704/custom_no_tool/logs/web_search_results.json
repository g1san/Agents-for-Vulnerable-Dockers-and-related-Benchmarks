    "desc": "CVE-2014-3704, commonly known as 'Drupageddon', is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal core versions 7.x before 7.32. This vulnerability arises from the improper construction of prepared statements in the expandArguments function within the database abstraction API. It allows remote attackers to exploit the system by crafting an array with malicious keys, enabling them to inject SQL commands. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as creating a new Drupal administrator user via the login form, enabling the PHP filter module, and executing arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability is highly severe, with a CVSS v2.0 base score of 7.5, and does not require authentication to be exploited, making it easily exploitable over a network.",
