    "desc": "CVE-2025-1974 is a critical vulnerability in the ingress-nginx, a popular ingress controller for Kubernetes. This vulnerability affects versions v1.12.1, v1.11.5, and any versions below v1.11.0, v1.11.0 to 1.11.4, and v1.12.0. It allows unauthenticated attackers with access to the pod network to execute arbitrary code within the ingress-nginx controller's context. This can lead to the exposure of Secrets accessible to the controller, potentially compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster. The vulnerability is part of a set of issues known as \"IngressNightmare\" and has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical severity. The ingress-nginx translates Ingress objects into nginx configurations, and the vulnerability can be exploited by specially-crafted Ingress objects. Immediate patching to versions v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or later is recommended, or alternatively, disabling the Validating Admission Controller feature can mitigate the risk temporarily.",
