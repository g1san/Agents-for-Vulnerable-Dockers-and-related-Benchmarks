    "desc": "CVE-2022-23221 is a critical vulnerability in the H2 Database Console, specifically affecting versions before 2.1.210. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting a flaw in the WebServer.java file, particularly in the getConnection function. Attackers can craft a malicious JDBC URL to bypass security restrictions and create an in-memory database. By using the URL `jdbc:h2:mem:1339;IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;` and the `INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM` parameter with a SQL file containing malicious code, attackers can execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-88 (Argument Injection) and has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a high severity due to its network-based attack vector, low complexity, and significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The issue has been patched in version 2.1.210.",
