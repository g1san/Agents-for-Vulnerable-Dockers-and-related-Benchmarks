    "desc": "CVE-2018-1000533 is a vulnerability found in Gitlist, a PHP-based graphical tool used for viewing Git repositories. This vulnerability is present in version 0.6.0 and earlier, where there is a command parameter injection issue in the `searchTree` function. The vulnerability arises due to improper sanitization of input that is passed to a system function, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code as the PHP user. This can be exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request through the search form. The exploitation of this flaw can lead to remote command execution, enabling attackers to perform malicious actions such as injecting a web shell into the website directory, which can be used to execute further commands remotely. This vulnerability is significant for penetration testing and vulnerability analysis, as it represents a critical security risk in affected versions of Gitlist.",
