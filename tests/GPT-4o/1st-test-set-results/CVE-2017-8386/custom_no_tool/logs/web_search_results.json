{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-8386 is a vulnerability in git-shell, a restricted shell used for Git operations over SSH. It arises when certain git commands, such as 'git-receive-pack --help', are executed. These commands open a man page using a pager like 'less', which can be used interactively to execute shell commands, bypassing git-shell restrictions. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution and file reading by exploiting the interactive features of 'less'. The issue is exploitable when the SSH server is configured to allocate a pseudo-terminal (pty) and when git-shell does not have a 'git-shell-commands' directory. It affects git-shell versions before 2.4.12, 2.5.x before 2.5.6, 2.6.x before 2.6.7, 2.7.x before 2.7.5, 2.8.x before 2.8.5, 2.9.x before 2.9.4, 2.10.x before 2.10.3, 2.11.x before 2.11.2, and 2.12.x before 2.12.3. Mitigation involves updating to fixed versions or configuring the server to prevent pty allocation.",
