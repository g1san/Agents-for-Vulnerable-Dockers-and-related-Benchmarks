    "desc": "CVE-2016-3088 is a critical vulnerability found in the Fileserver web application of Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.x before 5.14.0. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary files on the server, leading to remote code execution. The exploit involves using an HTTP PUT request to upload a malicious file and then an HTTP MOVE request to execute it. This flaw is due to improper handling of file uploads and directory permissions, particularly in configurations set in the `conf/jetty.xml` file. The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, highlighting its severity. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ version 5.14.0 or later, where the FileServer function has been removed, or to disable the FileServer by modifying the `jetty.xml` configuration.",
