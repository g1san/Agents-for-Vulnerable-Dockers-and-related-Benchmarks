{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-1297 is a high-severity security vulnerability found in Apache JMeter, a widely used open-source software for performance testing. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization in the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service of JMeter, specifically affecting versions 2.x and 3.x. This flaw allows attackers to send specially crafted payloads to the RMI service, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server running JMeter. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it permits unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary code, compromising the server and potentially leading to further attacks. The RMI connection used in JMeter's Distributed Test feature is unsecured, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access to the JMeterEngine. The network-based attack vector does not require privileges or user interaction, making it a significant risk with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 9.8. Users are advised to upgrade to JMeter version 4.0 or later, where this vulnerability has been patched, to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",
