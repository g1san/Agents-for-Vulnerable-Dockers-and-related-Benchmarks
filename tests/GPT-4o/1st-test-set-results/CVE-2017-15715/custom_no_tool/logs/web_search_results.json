    "desc": "CVE-2017-15715 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server, specifically affecting versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.29. The issue is rooted in the improper handling of the URL path normalization process and the <FilesMatch> directive. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass access control restrictions by sending a specially crafted request with a URL path containing a percent-encoded null byte or by using a malicious filename with a newline character. As a result, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive files or bypass file upload restrictions, leading to unauthorized access or remote code execution. This vulnerability can be exploited to bypass security controls intended to restrict user directory access on a web server, which could lead to significant security breaches. The vulnerability is significant due to its potential impact on access controls and sensitive information exposure. Administrators are advised to upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.30 or later and apply necessary patches to mitigate this issue.",
