{
    "desc": "CVE-2023-4450 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting the JimuReport component of JeecgBoot up to version 1.6.0. This vulnerability arises from the improper handling of user-supplied data within FreeMarker templates. Specifically, the /jeecg-boot/jmreport/queryFieldBySql endpoint processes SQL queries embedded within FreeMarker templates without adequate input validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious FreeMarker expressions, enabling them to execute arbitrary system commands using classes like freemarker.template.utility.Execute. The vulnerability is particularly severe if the endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication, as it allows remote, unauthenticated exploitation. Mitigations include updating to version 1.6.1 or later, restricting endpoint access, implementing input validation, disabling dangerous template methods, and monitoring for suspicious activity.",
