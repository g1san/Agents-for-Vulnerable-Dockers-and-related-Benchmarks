    "desc": "CVE-2019-20933 is an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting InfluxDB versions prior to 1.7.6. The vulnerability is located in the `authenticate` function within the `services/httpd/handler.go` file. It arises because a JSON Web Token (JWT) may be accepted with an empty SharedSecret, allowing unauthorized access. This security flaw permits attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database. The vulnerability is critical, with a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, and can be exploited remotely. It allows attackers to execute queries on a target InfluxDB instance using default credentials and settings, highlighting the ease of exploitation. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.7.6 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.",
