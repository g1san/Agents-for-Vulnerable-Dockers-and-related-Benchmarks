    "desc": "CVE-2020-13945 is a critical security vulnerability in Apache APISIX versions 1.2 to 1.5. It arises when the Admin API is enabled and IP restriction rules are deleted, allowing unauthorized access to the management data using a default token. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized administrative access, potentially leading to remote code execution by injecting arbitrary Lua scripts through the API. The vulnerability highlights the risks associated with default configurations and emphasizes the need for securing API access through proper token management and IP restrictions.",
