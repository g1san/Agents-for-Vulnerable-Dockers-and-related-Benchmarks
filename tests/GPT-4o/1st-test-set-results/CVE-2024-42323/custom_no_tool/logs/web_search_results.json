    "desc": "CVE-2024-42323 is a critical vulnerability affecting Apache HertzBeat, a real-time monitoring system, due to an issue in the SnakeYAML library used for parsing YAML files. The vulnerability exists in versions prior to 1.6.0 and is caused by improper validation and sanitization of imported YAML data through the API endpoints /api/monitors/import and /api/alert/defines/import. This flaw allows authenticated users to upload specially crafted YAML files that can lead to the deserialization of untrusted data, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary Java code on the server. This type of attack is classified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The impact of such an exploit is severe, as it could grant attackers full control over the affected system, allowing unauthorized access to data or further compromise of the system. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to upgrade Apache HertzBeat to version 1.6.0, where the vulnerability has been addressed.",
