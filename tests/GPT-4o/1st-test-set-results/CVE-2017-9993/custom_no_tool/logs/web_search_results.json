    "desc": "CVE-2017-9993 is a security vulnerability in FFmpeg, a widely used multimedia framework, affecting versions prior to 2.8.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.9, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, 3.2.x before 3.2.6, and 3.3.x before 3.3.2. The vulnerability involves improper restrictions on HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) filename extensions and demuxer names, which allows attackers to read arbitrary files via crafted playlist data. This issue can lead to exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200). Furthermore, this vulnerability can be exploited to bypass defenses and exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw, resulting in arbitrary data reading. The vulnerability can potentially be used to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service by processing certain malicious media files. The FFmpeg development team addressed this issue in later versions by implementing proper checks and handling during media processing.",
