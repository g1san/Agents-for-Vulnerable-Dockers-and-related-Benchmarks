    "desc": "CVE-2018-16509 is a vulnerability in Artifex Ghostscript versions prior to 9.24, which is a suite for interpreting Adobe PostScript and PDF languages. The flaw allows for remote shell command execution by bypassing the -dSAFER mode. This is achieved by exploiting a failed restore (grestore) in PostScript to disable LockSafetyParams and avoid invalid access. The vulnerability can be triggered through libraries that use Ghostscript as a backend, such as ImageMagick or Python's PIL/Pillow, by opening a specially crafted EPS image. This results in the execution of arbitrary commands on a server. The vulnerability was discovered by Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero and has a CVSS 3.0 severity score of 7.8, indicating a high severity level. The attack vector is local, with low complexity, requiring no privileges but necessitating user interaction. It impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
