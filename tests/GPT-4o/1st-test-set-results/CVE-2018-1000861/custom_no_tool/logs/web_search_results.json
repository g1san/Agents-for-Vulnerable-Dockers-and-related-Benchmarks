    "desc": "CVE-2018-1000861 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, specifically in the Stapler web framework used for HTTP request handling. This vulnerability allows for remote command injection, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected Jenkins servers without authentication. The vulnerability arises due to the reflective access Stapler uses to match naming conventions, allowing crafted URLs to invoke methods unintentionally. This can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands and potentially exploit the system to perform malicious activities such as cryptocurrency mining. The vulnerability affects Jenkins versions up to 2.153 and Jenkins LTS up to 2.138.3. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to update Jenkins to version 2.154 or Jenkins LTS to version 2.138.4 or 2.150.1.",
