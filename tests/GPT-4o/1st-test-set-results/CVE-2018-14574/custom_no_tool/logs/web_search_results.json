    "desc": "CVE-2018-14574 is an open redirect vulnerability found in Django's CommonMiddleware. This vulnerability impacts Django versions 1.11.0 through 1.11.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.8. The issue occurs when the APPEND_SLASH setting is enabled, which is the default configuration. If a URL without a trailing slash does not match any pattern in urlpatterns, Django appends a slash and attempts to resolve it again. This can lead to an unintended redirection if the new URL is resolved differently. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a URL that redirects users to an arbitrary domain, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities. This vulnerability is classified under CWE-601, related to open redirection issues, and it was addressed in Django by releasing patches for the affected versions.",
