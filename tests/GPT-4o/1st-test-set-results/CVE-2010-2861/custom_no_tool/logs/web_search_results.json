    "desc": "CVE-2010-2861 is a directory traversal vulnerability found in Adobe ColdFusion versions 9.0.1 and earlier. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to access restricted directories and potentially sensitive files by manipulating the 'locale' parameter in HTTP requests to various ColdFusion administrative pages, such as `/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm`. The issue arises due to insufficient validation of user input, enabling attackers to craft requests that include path traversal sequences. This can lead to unauthorized access to files like `password.properties`, which contains password hashes that attackers can use to authenticate as an admin without cracking the hash. Once logged in, attackers can further exploit the system, for example, by modifying web applications to capture sensitive data like credit card information. The vulnerability emphasizes the importance of keeping software updated and implementing security measures like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block such attacks.",
