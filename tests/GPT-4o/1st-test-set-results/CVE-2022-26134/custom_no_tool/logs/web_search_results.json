    "desc": "CVE-2022-26134 is a critical security vulnerability identified as an OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection flaw in Atlassian's Confluence Server and Data Center. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected servers by injecting OGNL payloads into the URI of an HTTP request. The issue affects all versions of Confluence Server and Data Center up to 7.13.6 LTS and 7.18.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability is widespread, especially on internet-facing servers, posing a significant risk. The vulnerability allows remote code execution, enabling attackers to gain control over the affected systems. To mitigate this vulnerability, Atlassian released patches and temporary workarounds, urging users to upgrade to fixed versions (7.4.17, 7.13.7, 7.14.3, 7.15.2, 7.16.4, 7.17.4, and 7.18.1) or restrict access to vulnerable instances.",
