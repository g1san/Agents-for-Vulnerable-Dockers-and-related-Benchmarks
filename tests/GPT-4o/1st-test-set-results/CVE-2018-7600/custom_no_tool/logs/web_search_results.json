{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-7600, also known as \"Drupalgeddon 2,\" is a critical security vulnerability affecting Drupal, a popular content management system. The vulnerability is present in Drupal versions 7.x before 7.58, 8.3.x before 8.3.9, 8.4.x before 8.4.6, and 8.5.x before 8.5.1. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to insufficient input validation in Drupal's Form API. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting AJAX requests that target renderable arrays used in Drupal's theming system. This flaw can be exploited without authentication, allowing attackers to take control of a site without needing to log in. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to site takeovers, reverse shells, and crypto-mining. It is critical for site administrators to apply security updates promptly to mitigate this risk.",
