    "desc": "CVE-2024-43441 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph-Server, identified as an Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data. This flaw affects versions 1.0 through 1.3 of HugeGraph-Server. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), where certain data elements assumed to be immutable can be manipulated by attackers. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations within HugeGraph-Server installations, posing significant risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, highlighting its severity. Apache has addressed this issue in version 1.5.0, and users are strongly advised to upgrade to mitigate the risk.",
