{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-35042 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability affecting Django, a popular Python-based web framework. This vulnerability arises when the `QuerySet.order_by()` method is used with untrusted input from a client in a web application. The issue allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the `order_by` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or denial of service. The vulnerability is present in Django versions 3.1.x before 3.1.13 and 3.2.x before 3.2.5. It is highly severe, with a CVSS score of 9.3, and can be exploited remotely without any privileges or user interaction. The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to Django version 3.1.13 or 3.2.5, which include a fix that prevents the injection of raw SQL references.",
