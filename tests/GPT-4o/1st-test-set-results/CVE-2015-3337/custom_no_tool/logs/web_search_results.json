    "desc": "CVE-2015-3337 is a directory traversal vulnerability found in Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.4.5 and 1.5.2. This vulnerability occurs when a 'site' plugin is installed, such as the Elastic Head plugin, which allows attackers to traverse directories and read arbitrary files on the server. By crafting specific URLs, attackers can exploit this flaw to access sensitive files like '/etc/passwd', posing a significant security risk by exposing sensitive system files and potentially leading to further exploitation. The vulnerability is due to insufficient path normalization in handling plugin paths, allowing unauthorized file access.",
