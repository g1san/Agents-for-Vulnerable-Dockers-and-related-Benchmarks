    "desc": "CVE-2017-12794 is a medium-severity cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the debug page of Django, a high-level Python web framework. This vulnerability specifically affects Django versions 1.10.7 and 1.11.4, where the issue arises from improper handling of exceptions on the 500 error page. When the debug mode is enabled, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to unauthorized actions or theft of sensitive information. The vulnerability is primarily relevant when using Django with PostgreSQL, as the psycopg2 library exposes field names and values in exceptions. The vulnerability was fixed in Django versions 1.10.8 and 1.11.5. To mitigate this risk, it is advised to disable debug mode in production environments and apply the necessary security patches.",
