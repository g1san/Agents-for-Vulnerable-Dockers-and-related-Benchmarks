    "desc": "CVE-2017-12636 is a critical vulnerability affecting Apache CouchDB and Apache Solr. In Apache CouchDB, the vulnerability allows remote code execution due to discrepancies between CouchDB's Erlang-based JSON parser and the JavaScript-based JSON parser. It enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by exploiting the server's configuration via HTTP(S), potentially downloading and executing scripts from the internet. The issue affects CouchDB versions before 1.7.1 and 2.1.1. In Apache Solr, the vulnerability is associated with the DataImportHandler (DIH) feature, which can be exploited to allow remote code execution. If the DIH is improperly secured, it can be accessed by unauthorized users to execute arbitrary code on the server. This highlights the importance of securing Solr configurations, especially when using features like DIH that can be exploited if left exposed.",
