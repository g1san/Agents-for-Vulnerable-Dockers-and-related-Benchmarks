    "desc": "CVE-2019-11581 is a critical security vulnerability in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center, affecting versions from 4.4.0 up to, but not including, 7.6.14, 7.7.0 to 7.13.5, 8.0.0 to 8.0.3, 8.1.0 to 8.1.2, and 8.2.0 to 8.2.3. This vulnerability arises from a server-side template injection flaw in the Contact Administrators form and the SendBulkMail feature. The issue can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request that injects malicious code via the subject field of the contact form. This code is then executed on the server, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if the Contact Administrators form is enabled and an SMTP server is configured. It can also be exploited through the SendBulkMail feature if the attacker has administrative credentials. The flaw is considered critical as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and services provided by Jira. The vulnerability has been addressed in versions 7.6.14, 7.13.5, 8.0.3, 8.1.2, and 8.2.3, and users are advised to update to these versions to mitigate the risk.",
