    "desc": "CVE-2024-27348 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting Apache HugeGraph Server versions 1.0.0 to 1.2.1. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via Groovy injection. The flaw is located in the Gremlin traversal language interface, which is used for interacting with the graph database. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the server, potentially bypassing the sandbox and executing arbitrary code on the underlying system. This vulnerability poses significant security risks as it enables unauthorized access and control over the server. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to upgrade to HugeGraph version 1.3.0 or later, ensure it runs on Java 11, and implement the built-in authentication system with \"Whitelist-IP/port\" configuration to restrict access and enhance security.",
