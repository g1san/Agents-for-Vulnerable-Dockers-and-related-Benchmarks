    "desc": "CVE-2023-29300 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion, which is a widely used web application development platform. This vulnerability is a pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server without prior authentication. The vulnerability arises from unsafe deserialization of WDDX packets using the Java Reflection API, which can be manipulated to invoke certain methods on Java objects, leading to a JNDI injection. This can allow attackers to deploy webshells and establish persistence on compromised devices. The vulnerability affects ColdFusion versions 2018, 2021, and 2023, specifically versions 2018u16 and earlier, 2021u6 and earlier, and 2023.0.0.330468 and earlier. Adobe has released security updates to address this vulnerability, recommending users update to ColdFusion 2018 Update 17, ColdFusion 2021 Update 7, and ColdFusion 2023 Update 1. The vulnerability has been actively exploited by threat actors, including cybercriminals and state-sponsored APT groups, across various sectors.",
