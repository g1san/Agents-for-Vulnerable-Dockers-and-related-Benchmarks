{
    "desc": "CVE-2015-5531 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.0. This vulnerability enables remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the system by exploiting the Elasticsearch snapshot API. By manipulating file paths using sequences like \"../\", attackers can access files and directories outside the intended directory structure. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure, allowing attackers to access sensitive files such as application source code or configuration files. It is remotely exploitable, does not require user interaction, and attackers do not need prior access to the system. The issue was resolved in versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0. Users can mitigate the vulnerability by upgrading to these versions or by employing a firewall, reverse proxy, or Shield to block snapshot API calls from untrusted sources.",
