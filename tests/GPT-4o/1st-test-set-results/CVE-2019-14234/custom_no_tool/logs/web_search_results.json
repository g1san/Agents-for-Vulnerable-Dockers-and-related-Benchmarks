    "desc": "CVE-2019-14234 is a SQL injection vulnerability affecting Django's JSONField and HStoreField model fields. It was discovered in Django versions 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of key and index lookups, where user input can be directly concatenated into SQL statements without proper sanitization. This flaw is particularly exploitable through the Django-Admin application, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code if they can control the key names used in a query. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized data access or manipulation, potentially leading to remote code execution through PostgreSQL features. It is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity and requires no privileges or user interaction. The vulnerability was addressed in security updates released on August 1, 2019.",
