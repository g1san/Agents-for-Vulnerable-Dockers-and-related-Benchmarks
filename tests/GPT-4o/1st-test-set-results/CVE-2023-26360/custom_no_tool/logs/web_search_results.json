    "desc": "CVE-2023-26360 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion, a web application development platform. Initially classified as an Improper Access Control issue, it was later identified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability. This flaw allows unauthorized Remote Code Execution (RCE) when an attacker sends a specially crafted request with untrusted data to a ColdFusion server. The vulnerability is severe as it does not require user interaction, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has highlighted the active exploitation of this vulnerability, which cyber threat actors use to gain initial access to public-facing Adobe ColdFusion servers. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, categorizing it as Critical. Affected versions include ColdFusion 2018 Update 15 and earlier, and ColdFusion 2021 Update 5 and earlier. Adobe has released updates to address this issue, and users are advised to update to ColdFusion 2018 Update 16 and ColdFusion 2021 Update 6.",
