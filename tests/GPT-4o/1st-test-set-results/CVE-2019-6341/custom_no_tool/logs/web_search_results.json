    "desc": "CVE-2019-6341 is a critical vulnerability in Drupal, a widely used content management system. This vulnerability stems from inadequate validation in the Drupal core's REST module when processing certain requests. Specifically, if the REST module is enabled and configured to allow PATCH or POST requests, an attacker with permission to send requests to the REST API can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can result in full control of the affected system. The vulnerability affects Drupal 7 versions prior to 7.65, Drupal 8.6 versions prior to 8.6.13, and Drupal 8.5 versions prior to 8.5.14. It can also manifest as a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability through the file module, allowing attackers to upload malicious files that execute scripts when accessed by users. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities. Mitigation involves proper configuration and updating to the latest Drupal versions.",
