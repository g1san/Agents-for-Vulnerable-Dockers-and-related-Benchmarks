    "desc": "CVE-2018-19475 is a vulnerability in Ghostscript, an interpreter for PostScript and PDF files, allowing arbitrary shell command execution even in its SAFER mode. The vulnerability arises from a sandbox bypass that can be exploited when processing untrusted PostScript or PDF files. Ghostscript uses a %pipe% syntax to start a new process with any shell command, which is disabled in SAFER mode to prevent security issues. However, the vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the LockSafetyParams, enabling the execution of shell commands by altering the OutputFile parameter. The exploit involves triggering an error during a restore operation, leaving the device in a state where LockSafetyParams is set to false. This specific issue, identified as an 'Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast,' affects versions of Ghostscript prior to 9.26. The vulnerability can potentially be exploited to manipulate type conversions or casts incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues in applications utilizing Ghostscript for file processing. The recommended mitigation is to update Ghostscript to a version where this vulnerability is patched.",
