      "description": "## Summary\nA flaw in netty's parsing of chunk extensions in HTTP/1.1 messages with chunked encoding can lead to request smuggling issues with some reverse proxies.\n\n## Details\nWhen encountering a newline character (LF) while parsing a chunk extension, netty interprets the newline as the end of the chunk-size line regardless of whether a preceding carriage return (CR) was found. This is in violation of the HTTP 1.1 standard which specifies that the chunk extension is terminated by a CRLF sequence (see the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunked-transfer-coding)).\n\nThis is by itself harmless, but consider an intermediary with a similar parsing flaw: while parsing a chunk extension, the intermediary interprets an LF without a preceding CR as simply part of the chunk extension (this is also in violation of the RFC, because whitespace characters are not allowed in chunk extensions). We can use this discrepancy to construct an HTTP request that the intermediary will interpret as one request but netty will interpret as two (all lines ending with CRLF, notice the LFs in the chunk extension):\n\n```\nPOST /one HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n48;\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n0\n\nPOST /two HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\n```\n\nThe intermediary will interpret this as a single request. Once forwarded to netty, netty will interpret it as two separate requests. This is a problem, because attackers can then the intermediary, as well as perform standard request smuggling attacks against other live users (see [this Portswigger article](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting)).\n\n## Impact\nThis is a request smuggling issue which can be exploited for bypassing front-end access control rules as well as corrupting the responses served to other live clients.\n\nThe impact is high, but it only affects setups that use a front-end which:\n1. Interprets LF characters (without preceding CR) in chunk extensions as part of the chunk extension.\n2. Forwards chunk extensions without normalization.\n\n## Disclosure\n\n - This vulnerability was disclosed on June 18th, 2025 here: https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html\n\n## Discussion\nDiscussion for this vulnerability can be found here:\n - https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15522\n - https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/unCVEed/issues/1\n\n## Credit\n\n - Credit to @JeppW for uncovering this vulnerability.\n - Credit to @JLLeitschuh at [Socket](https://socket.dev/) for coordinating the vulnerability disclosure.",

      "description": "### Overview\n\nA flaw in Jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible **information disclosure** in systems using **pooled or reused buffers**, like Netty or Vert.x.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability affects the creation of exception messages like:\n\n```\nJsonParseException: Unexpected character ... at [Source: (byte[])...]\n```\n\nWhen `JsonFactory.createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len)` is used, and an error occurs while parsing, the exception message should include a snippet from the specified logical payload. However, the method `_appendSourceDesc` ignores the `offset`, and always starts reading from index `0`.\n\nIf the buffer contains residual sensitive data from a previous request, such as credentials or document contents, that data may be exposed if the exception is propagated to the client.\n\nThe issue particularly impacts server applications using:\n\n* Pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty)\n* Frameworks that surface parse errors in HTTP responses\n* Default Jackson settings (i.e., `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` is enabled)\n\nA documented real-world example is [CVE-2021-22145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145) in Elasticsearch, which stemmed from the same root cause.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker sends malformed JSON to a service using Jackson and pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty-based HTTP servers). If the server reuses a buffer and includes the parser’s exception in its HTTP 400 response, the attacker may receive residual data from previous requests.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1000];\nSystem.arraycopy(\"SECRET\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 0, 6);\nSystem.arraycopy(\"{ \\\"bad\\\": }\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 700, 10);\n\nJsonFactory factory = new JsonFactory();\nJsonParser parser = factory.createParser(buffer, 700, 20);\nparser.nextToken(); // throws exception\n\n// Exception message will include \"SECRET\"\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via [PR #652](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652).\n\nAll users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by:\n\n1. **Disabling exception message exposure to clients** — avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses.\n2. **Disabling source inclusion in exceptions** by setting:\n\n   ```java\n   jsonFactory.disable(JsonFactory.Feature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION);\n   ```\n\n    This prevents Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\n\n### References\n* [Pull Request #652 (Fix implementation)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652)\n* [CVE-2021-22145 (Elasticsearch exposure of this flaw)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145)",

If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash.\n\n\n### Details\n\nWhen the library netty is loaded in a java windows application, the library tries to identify the system environnement in which it is executed.\n\nAt this stage, Netty tries to load both `/etc/os-release` and `/usr/lib/os-release` even though it is in a Windows environment. \n\n<img width=\"364\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9466b181-9394-45a3-b0e3-1dcf105def59\">\n\nIf netty finds this files, it reads them and loads them into memory.\n\nBy default :\n\n- The JVM maximum memory size is set to 1 GB,\n- A non-privileged user can create a directory at `C:\\` and create files within it.\n\n<img width=\"340\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b359a2-5871-4592-ae2b-ffc40ac76831\">\n\n<img width=\"523\" alt=\"3\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5c6eed-451c-4513-92d5-ba0eee7715c1\">\n\nthe source code identified :\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/internal/PlatformDependent.java\n\nDespite the implementation of the function `normalizeOs()` the source code not verify the OS before reading `C:\\etc\\os-release` and `C:\\usr\\lib\\os-release`.\n\n### PoC\n\nCreate a file larger than 1 GB of data in `C:\\etc\\os-release` or `C:\\usr\\lib\\os-release` on a Windows environnement and start your Netty application.\n\nTo observe what the application does with the file, the security analyst used \"Process Monitor\" from the \"Windows SysInternals\" suite.

Furthermore, the exploitation works with defaults windows/AD settings.\n- Scope : \"Unchanged\" because only Netty is affected by the vulnerability.\n- Confidentiality : \"None\" because no data is exposed through exploiting the vulnerability.\n- Integrity : \"None\" because the explotation of the vulnerability does not allow editing, deleting or adding data elsewhere.\n- Availability : \"High\" because the exploitation of this vulnerability crashes the entire java application.",

Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.\n\n### Vulnerability Details ###\n\nTo fix the vulnerability the code was changed to the following:\n\n```java\n    @SuppressJava6Requirement(reason = \"Guarded by version check\")\n    public static File createTempFile(String prefix, String suffix, File directory) throws IOException {\n        if (javaVersion() >= 7) {\n            if (directory == null) {\n                return Files.createTempFile(prefix, suffix).toFile();\n            }\n            return Files.createTempFile(directory.toPath(), prefix, suffix).toFile();\n        }\n        if (directory == null) {\n            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);\n        }\n        File file = File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, directory);\n        // Try to adjust the perms, if this fails there is not much else we can do...\n        file.setReadable(false, false);\n        file.setReadable(true, true);\n        return file;\n    }\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this logic path was left vulnerable:\n\n```java\n        if (directory == null) {\n            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);\n        }\n```\n\nThis file is still readable by all local users.\n\n### Patches ###\n\nUpdate to 4.1.77.Final\n\n### Workarounds ###\n\nSpecify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM or use `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)` to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user or update to Java 7 or above.\n\n### References ###\n\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n\n\n### For more information ###\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)\n",

      "description": "### Impact\nIf a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up.  This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1.\nIf the request comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted into the HTTP/1.1 domain objects (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent up to the child channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1 this may result in request smuggling.  \n\nIn a proxy case, users  may assume the content-length is validated somehow, which is not the case.  If the request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked.\n\nAn attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1.   A sample attack request looks like:\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/2\n:authority:: externaldomain.com\nContent-Length: 4\n\nasdfGET /evilRedirect HTTP/1.1\nHost: internaldomain.com\n```\n\nUsers are only affected if all of this is `true`:\n * `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used\n * `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects\n * These  HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer.\n \n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in 4.1.60.Final\n\n### Workarounds\nThe user can do the validation by themselves by implementing a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.\n\n### References\nRelated change to workaround the problem: https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/pull/980 ",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nWhen netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled.\n\nThe CVSSv3.1 score of this vulnerability is calculated to be a [6.2/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\nOn unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.\n\nThe method `File.createTempFile` on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information.\n\nThis is the case in netty's `AbstractDiskHttpData` is vulnerable.\n\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/multipart/AbstractDiskHttpData.java#L80-L101\n\n`AbstractDiskHttpData` is used as a part of the `DefaultHttpDataFactory` class which is used by `HttpPostRequestDecoder` / `HttpPostMultiPartRequestDecoder`.\n\nYou may be affected by this vulnerability your project contains the following code patterns:\n\n```java\nchannelPipeline.addLast(new HttpPostRequestDecoder(...));\n```\n\n```java\nchannelPipeline.addLast(new HttpPostMultiPartRequestDecoder(...));\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in version `4.1.59.Final`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSpecify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM or use `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)` to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n### References\n\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n\n### Similar Vulnerabilities\n\nSimilar, but not the same.\n\n - JUnit 4 - https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n - Google Guava - https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\n - Apache Ant - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1945\n - JetBrains Kotlin Compiler - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15824\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)\n* Email us [here](mailto:netty-security@googlegroups.com)\n\n### Original Report\n\n> Hi Netty Security Team,\n> \n> I've been working on some security research leveraging custom CodeQL queries to detect local information disclosure vulnerabilities in java applications. This was the result from running this query against the netty project:\n> https://lgtm.com/query/7723301787255288599/\n> \n> Netty contains three local information disclosure vulnerabilities, so far as I can tell.\n> \n> One is here, where the private key for the certificate is written to a temporary file.\n> \n> https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/util/SelfSignedCertificate.java#L316-L346\n> \n> One is here, where the certificate is written to a temporary file.\n> \n> https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/util/SelfSignedCertificate.java#L348-L371\n> \n> The final one is here, where the 'AbstractDiskHttpData' creates a temporary file if the getBaseDirectory() method returns null. I believe that 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is used as a part of the file upload support? If this is the case, any files uploaded would be similarly vulnerable.\n> \n> https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/multipart/AbstractDiskHttpData.java#L91\n> \n> All of these vulnerabilities exist because `File.createTempFile(String, String)` will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set. It is my understanding that when java creates a file, by default, and using this method, the permissions on that file utilize the umask. In a majority of cases, this means that the file that java creates has the permissions: `-rw-r--r--`, thus, any other local user on that system can read the contents of that file.\n> \n> Impacted OS:\n> - Any OS where the system temporary directory is shared between multiple users. This is not the case for MacOS or Windows.\n> \n> Mitigation.\n> \n> Moving to the `Files` API instead will fix this vulnerability. \n> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile-java.nio.file.Path-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-\n> \n> This API will explicitly set the posix file permissions to something safe, by default.\n> \n> I recently disclosed a similar vulnerability in JUnit 4:\n> https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n> \n> If you're also curious, this vulnerability in Jetty was also mine, also involving temporary directories, but is not the same vulnerability as in this case.\n> https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-g3wg-6mcf-8jj6\n> \n> I would appreciate it if we could perform disclosure of this vulnerability leveraging the GitHub security advisories feature here. GitHub has a nice credit system that I appreciate, plus the disclosures, as you can see from the sampling above, end up looking very nice.\n> https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories\n> \n> This vulnerability disclosure follows Google's [90-day vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/) (I'm not an employee of Google, I just like their policy). Full disclosure will occur either at the end of the 90-day deadline or whenever a patch is made widely available, whichever occurs first.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> Jonathan Leitschuh",

      "description": "### Summary\nThe `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap.\n\n### Details\nThe `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record. \n\nNormally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`\n\n1/ allocate a 16MB `ByteBuf`\n2/ not fail `decode` method `in` buffer\n3/ get out of the loop without an exception\n\nThe combination of this without the use of a timeout makes  easy to connect to a TCP server and allocate 16MB of heap memory per connection.\n\n### Impact\nIf the user has no idle timeout handler configured it might be possible for a remote peer to send a client hello packet which lead the server to buffer up to 16MB of data per connection. This could lead to a OutOfMemoryError and so result in a DDOS.",

      "description": "Below is a technical explanation of a newly discovered vulnerability in HTTP/2, which we refer to as “MadeYouReset.”\n\n### MadeYouReset Vulnerability Summary\nThe MadeYouReset DDoS vulnerability is a logical vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol, that uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames in order to break the max concurrent streams limit - which results in resource exhaustion and distributed denial of service.\n\n### Mechanism\nThe vulnerability uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames, or malformed flow, in order to make the server reset streams created by the client (using the RST_STREAM frame). \nThe vulnerability could be triggered by several primitives, defined by the RFC of HTTP/2 (RFC 9113). The Primitives are:\n1. WINDOW_UPDATE frame with an increment of 0 or an increment that makes the window exceed 2^31 - 1. (section 6.9 + 6.9.1)\n2. HEADERS or DATA frames sent on a half-closed (remote) stream (which was closed using the END_STREAM flag). (note that for some implementations it's possible a CONTINUATION frame to trigger that as well - but it's very rare). (Section 5.1)\n3. PRIORITY frame with a length other than 5. (section 6.3)\nFrom our experience, the primitives are likely to exist in the decreasing order listed above.\nNote that based on the implementation of the library, other primitives (which are not defined by the RFC) might exist - meaning scenarios in which RST_STREAM is not supposed to be sent, but in the implementation it does. On the other hand - some RFC-defined primitives might not work, even though they are defined by the RFC (as some implementations are not fully complying with RFC). For example, some implementations we’ve seen discard the PRIORITY frame - and thus does not return RST_STREAM, and some implementations send GO_AWAY when receiving a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with increment of 0.\n\nThe vulnerability takes advantage of a design flaw in the HTTP/2 protocol - While HTTP/2 has a limit on the number of concurrently active streams per connection (which is usually 100, and is set by the parameter SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS), the number of active streams is not counted correctly - when a stream is reset, it is immediately considered not active, and thus unaccounted for in the active streams counter. \nWhile the protocol does not count those streams as active, the server’s backend logic still processes and handles the requests that were canceled.\n\nThus, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams from a client on the same connection. The exploitation is very simple: the client issues a request in a stream, and then sends the control frame that causes the server to send a RST_STREAM.\n\n### Attack Flow\nFor example, a possible attack scenario can be: \n1. Attacker opens an HTTP/2 connection to the server.\n2. Attacker sends HEADERS frame with END_STREAM flag on a new stream X.  \n3. Attacker sends WINDOW_UPDATE for stream X with flow-control window of 0.\n4. The server receives the WINDOW_UPDATE and immediately sends RST_STREAM for stream X to the client (+ decreases the active streams counter by 1).\n\nThe attacker can repeat steps 2+3 as rapidly as it is capable, since the active streams counter never exceeds 1 and the attacker does not need to wait for the response from the server.\nThis leads to resource exhaustion and distributed denial of service vulnerabilities with an impact of: CPU overload and/or memory exhaustion (implementation dependent)\n\n### Comparison to Rapid Reset\nThe vulnerability takes advantage of a design flow in the HTTP/2 protocol that was also used in the Rapid Reset vulnerability (CVE-2023-44487) which was exploited as a zero-day in the wild in August 2023 to October 2023, against multiple services and vendors.\nThe Rapid Reset vulnerability uses RST_STREAM frames sent from the client, in order to create an unbounded amount of concurrent streams - it was given a CVSS score of 7.5.\nRapid Reset was mostly mitigated by limiting the number/rate of RST_STREAM sent from the client, which does not mitigate the MadeYouReset attack - since it triggers the server to send a RST_STREAM.\n\n### Suggested Mitigations for MadeYouReset\nA quick and easy mitigation will be to limit the number/rate of RST_STREAMs sent from the server.\nIt is also possible to limit the number/rate of control frames sent by the client (e.g. WINDOW_UPDATE and PRIORITY), and treat protocol flow errors as a connection error.\n\nAs mentioned in our previous message, this is a protocol-level vulnerability that affects multiple vendors and implementations. Given its broad impact, it is the shared responsibility of all parties involved to handle the disclosure process carefully and coordinate mitigations effectively.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, we will be happy to clarify or schedule a Zoom call.\n\nGal, Anat and Yaniv.",

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a remote code execution (RCE) attack. \n\n## Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\n# Mitigation\n\nLog4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (< 2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).\n\nLog4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability.",

      "description": "# Summary\n\nLog4j versions prior to 2.16.0 are subject to a remote code execution vulnerability via the ldap JNDI parser.\nAs per [Apache's Log4j security guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html): Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.16.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.\n\nLog4j version 2.15.0 contained an earlier fix for the vulnerability, but that patch did not disable attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in all situations. For more information, see the `Updated advice for version 2.16.0` section of this advisory.\n\n# Impact\n\nLogging untrusted or user controlled data with a vulnerable version of Log4J may result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) against your application. This includes untrusted data included in logged errors such as exception traces, authentication failures, and other unexpected vectors of user controlled input. \n\n# Affected versions\n\nAny Log4J version prior to v2.15.0 is affected to this specific issue.\n\nThe v1 branch of Log4J which is considered End Of Life (EOL) is vulnerable to other RCE vectors so the recommendation is to still update to 2.16.0 where possible.\n\n## Security releases\nAdditional backports of this fix have been made available in versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, and 2.12.3\n\n## Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\n# Remediation Advice\n\n## Updated advice for version 2.16.0\n\nThe Apache Logging Services team provided updated mitigation advice upon the release of version 2.16.0, which [disables JNDI by default and completely removes support for message lookups](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0).\nEven in version 2.15.0, lookups used in layouts to provide specific pieces of context information will still recursively resolve, possibly triggering JNDI lookups. This problem is being tracked as [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). More information is available on the [GitHub Security Advisory for CVE-2021-45046](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33).\n\nUsers who want to avoid attacker-controlled JNDI lookups but cannot upgrade to 2.16.0 must [ensure that no such lookups resolve to attacker-provided data and ensure that the the JndiLookup class is not loaded](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3221).\n\nPlease note that Log4J v1 is End Of Life (EOL) and will not receive patches for this issue. Log4J v1 is also vulnerable to other RCE vectors and we recommend you migrate to Log4J 2.16.0 where possible.",
