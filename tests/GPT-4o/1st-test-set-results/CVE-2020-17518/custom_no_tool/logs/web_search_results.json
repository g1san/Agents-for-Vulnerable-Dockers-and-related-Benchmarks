{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-17518 is a vulnerability in Apache Flink's RESTful API, specifically within the `FileUploadHandler.java` class. It allows for arbitrary file uploads via directory traversal due to unsanitized user input for the filename parameter. This vulnerability affects Apache Flink versions 1.5.1 to 1.11.2. An attacker can exploit this by crafting HTTP requests to upload files to arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to remote code execution. The issue was resolved in version 1.11.3 by modifying the code to sanitize the filename input, preventing path traversal. This vulnerability is critical as it can be exploited remotely without authentication, posing a significant risk to systems running affected versions of Apache Flink.",
