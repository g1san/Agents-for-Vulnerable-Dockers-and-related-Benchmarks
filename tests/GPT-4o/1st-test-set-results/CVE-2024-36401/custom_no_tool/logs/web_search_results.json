    "desc": "CVE-2024-36401 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in GeoServer, an open-source Java-based platform used for sharing and editing geospatial data. This vulnerability arises from the unsafe evaluation of property names as XPath expressions due to issues in the GeoTools library, specifically impacting versions prior to 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted inputs via OGC request parameters, allowing them to execute arbitrary code remotely. The vulnerability is particularly concerning for sectors reliant on geospatial data, such as government agencies. It has been actively exploited in the wild, with threat actors deploying malware including botnets, backdoors, and coin miners. Mitigation involves updating GeoServer to patched versions or applying a workaround by removing the gt-complex-x.y.jar file, although this may affect some functionalities.",
