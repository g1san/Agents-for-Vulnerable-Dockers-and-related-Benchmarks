    "desc": "CVE-2021-26084 is a critical security vulnerability affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center. It involves an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) injection, which allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code on affected instances. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the server. The vulnerability impacts versions before 6.13.23, from 6.14.0 to before 7.4.11, from 7.5.0 to before 7.11.6, and from 7.12.0 to before 7.12.5. Confluence Cloud sites are not impacted. The vulnerability is actively exploited, necessitating immediate patching. It was discovered by Benny Jacob via Atlassian's bug bounty program. Atlassian recommends upgrading to fixed versions or applying temporary mitigations if upgrading isn't feasible.",
