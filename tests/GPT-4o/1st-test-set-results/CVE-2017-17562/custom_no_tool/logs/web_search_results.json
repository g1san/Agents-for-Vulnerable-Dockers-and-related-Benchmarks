    "desc": "CVE-2017-17562 is a critical vulnerability affecting the GoAhead web server versions prior to 3.6.5. The flaw exists in the cgiHandler function within cgi.c, where the environment for forked CGI scripts is improperly initialized using untrusted HTTP request parameters. This vulnerability allows remote code execution by exploiting the glibc dynamic linker's special environment variables, such as LD_PRELOAD, which can be used to load arbitrary shared objects for function hooking. An attacker can inject arbitrary environment variables, leading to alternative control flows in the dynamic linker. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when CGI support is enabled and CGI programs are dynamically linked. Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.",
