    "desc": "CVE-2020-11981 is a critical vulnerability in Apache Airflow, specifically affecting versions up to 1.10.10. This vulnerability arises in the CeleryExecutor component of Airflow, which fails to properly sanitize inputs, leading to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker, without needing authentication, can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to the Airflow web server. These requests can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Airflow. The vulnerability is severe, with a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, indicating that it can potentially allow unauthorized access or control over the server, exposing sensitive data or disrupting operations. The issue is particularly concerning when the attacker can directly access the broker, such as Redis or RabbitMQ, which are often used with the CeleryExecutor. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to upgrade Apache Airflow to version 1.10.11 or later and ensure that broker connections are secured to prevent unauthorized access.",
