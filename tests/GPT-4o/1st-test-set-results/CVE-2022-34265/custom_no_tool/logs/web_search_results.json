    "desc": "CVE-2022-34265 is a critical vulnerability in the Django web framework, specifically affecting the Trunc() and Extract() database functions. Disclosed on July 5, 2022, this flaw allows for SQL injection attacks due to improper string processing when untrusted data is used in the 'kind' argument of Trunc or 'lookup_name' argument of Extract. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even database deletion, with a CVSS score of 9.8 indicating its severity. The affected versions are Django 3.2.x prior to 3.2.14 and 4.0.x prior to 4.0.6. Users are strongly advised to update to Django 3.2.14 or 4.0.6 to mitigate the risk.
