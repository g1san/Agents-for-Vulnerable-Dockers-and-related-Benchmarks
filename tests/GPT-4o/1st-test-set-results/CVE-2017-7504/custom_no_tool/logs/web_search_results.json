    "desc": "CVE-2017-7504 is a critical vulnerability found in the JBoss Application Server, specifically within the HTTPServerILServlet.java component of the JMS over HTTP Invocation Layer in the JBossMQ implementation. This vulnerability affects Red Hat JBoss Application Server versions up to and including JBoss 4.x. The issue arises because the server does not restrict the classes for which it performs deserialization. As a result, remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code by sending crafted serialized data to the server. This flaw is classified under CWE-502 and has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerable servlet endpoint is `/jbossmq-httpil/HTTPServerILServlet`, and exploitation can be confirmed by executing arbitrary code, such as creating a file on the server.",
