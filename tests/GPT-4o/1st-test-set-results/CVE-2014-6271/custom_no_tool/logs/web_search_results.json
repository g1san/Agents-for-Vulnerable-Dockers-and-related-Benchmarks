    "desc": "CVE-2014-6271, also known as \"Shellshock,\" is a critical vulnerability found in the GNU Bash shell, a widely used command-line interpreter on Unix-based systems. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems by exploiting improperly handled environment variables. The flaw is due to Bash incorrectly parsing function definitions in environment variables, enabling remote code execution. This vulnerability is particularly exploitable in network services that use Bash scripts to process data, such as HTTP requests, making it a significant security risk for systems where Bash is the default command interpreter. It can be triggered through various services that utilize Bash for processing requests, particularly web servers using CGI scripts. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and control over the system, making it a significant security threat that requires immediate attention and patching.",
