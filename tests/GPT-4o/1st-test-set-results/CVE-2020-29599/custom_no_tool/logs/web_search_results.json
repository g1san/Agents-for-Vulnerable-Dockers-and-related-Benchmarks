    "desc": "CVE-2020-29599 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick that affects versions before 6.9.11-40 and 7.x before 7.0.10-40. The vulnerability is related to the handling of the '-authenticate' parameter, which is used for setting passwords on PDF files. The flaw occurs because user-controlled passwords are not properly escaped or sanitized, allowing for shell command injection. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input string, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation could compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system. This issue has been fixed in ImageMagick 7.0.10-40 and later versions.",
