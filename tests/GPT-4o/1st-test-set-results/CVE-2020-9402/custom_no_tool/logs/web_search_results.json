    "desc": "CVE-2020-9402 is a security vulnerability in the Django web framework, specifically affecting its Geographic Information System (GIS) module when used with Oracle databases. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the 'tolerance' parameter in GIS functions and aggregates, which can be exploited to perform SQL injection attacks. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious SQL through the 'tolerance' parameter, potentially compromising the database's integrity and security. The vulnerability affects Django versions 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4. A patch has been issued to address this issue by ensuring the 'tolerance' parameter is properly validated.",
