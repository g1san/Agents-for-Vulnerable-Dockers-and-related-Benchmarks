{
    "desc": "CVE-2022-41678 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, specifically involving the Jolokia interface. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely by exploiting the Jolokia API. The vulnerability arises from the way the Jolokia API handles HTTP requests, allowing attackers to perform actions such as Arbitrary File Write, Arbitrary File Read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and Arbitrary File Overwrite using Java Flight Recorder (JFR). The vulnerability is present in Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.16.0 to 5.16.5 and 5.17.0 to 5.17.3. It is exploitable when Jolokia is configured to handle requests via the Jetty server in ActiveMQ, particularly through the `org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler`. The attack involves invoking the `ExecHandler#doHandleRequest` method through reflection, leading to remote code execution via Java Management Extensions (JMX) and mbeans. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to upgrade to versions 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, or 6.0.0 and above, which include more restrictive Jolokia configurations. Temporary mitigation measures include enabling web console authentication and restricting access to the Jolokia interface or disabling it if not needed.",
