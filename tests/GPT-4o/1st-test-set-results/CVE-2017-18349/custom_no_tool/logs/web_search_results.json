    "desc": "CVE-2017-18349 is a critical vulnerability found in Fastjson, a Java library developed by Alibaba for JSON parsing and deserialization. The vulnerability is present in versions up to 1.2.24 and involves the 'parseObject' function, which can be exploited through insecure deserialization. The issue arises from the AutoType feature, which uses the '@type' attribute to specify the original type of JSON characters during deserialization. This feature can be exploited by crafting a malicious JSON payload that specifies an attack class library using the '@type' attribute. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted JSON data to a vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it allows for remote code execution (RCE) by leveraging Fastjson's capability to deserialize JSON data, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Exploitation typically involves setting up a web service and RMI service on a target system, and using a crafted JSON payload to trigger the deserialization process, which then executes remote code. The vulnerability underscores the importance of careful configuration and validation when handling deserialization in applications.",
