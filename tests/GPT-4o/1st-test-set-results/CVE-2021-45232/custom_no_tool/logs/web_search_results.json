    "desc": "CVE-2021-45232 is an unauthorized access vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard, affecting versions 2.7 through 2.10. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms due to improper access control and input validation, enabling them to gain unauthorized access to the dashboard. Once accessed, attackers can leverage this unauthorized entry to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to remote code execution (RCE). The flaw arises from the use of two frameworks, 'droplet' and 'gin', where certain APIs bypass authentication checks. The vulnerability poses significant security risks, allowing for potential misuse in executing unauthorized commands, obtaining configuration information, and making unauthorized changes to the system. Users are advised to update to version 2.10.1 or later to mitigate this issue.",
