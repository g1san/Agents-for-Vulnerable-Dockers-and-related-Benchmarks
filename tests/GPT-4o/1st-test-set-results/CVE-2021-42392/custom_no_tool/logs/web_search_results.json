    "desc": "CVE-2021-42392 is a critical security flaw in the H2 database, particularly affecting the console component. This vulnerability is reminiscent of the Log4Shell exploit due to its use of Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) for remote class loading. The issue allows unauthenticated remote code execution through the H2 console, which can be configured for remote access. The root cause is the unfiltered passing of attacker-controlled URLs to the `javax.naming.Context.lookup` function, enabling the loading of remote codebases. The most severe exploitation vector is via the H2 console, which can be accessed without authentication if configured improperly. The vulnerability impacts versions from 1.1.100 up to, but not including, 2.0.206. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.0.206 or later to mitigate the risk, as this version restricts JNDI URLs to local protocols, preventing remote LDAP/RMI queries.",
