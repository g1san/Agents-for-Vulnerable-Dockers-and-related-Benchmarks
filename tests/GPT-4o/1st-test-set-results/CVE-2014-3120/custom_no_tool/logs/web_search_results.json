    "desc": "CVE-2014-3120 is a high-severity vulnerability found in Elasticsearch versions 1.1.1 and 1.2, where the default configuration allows for dynamic scripting. This flaw enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary MVEL expressions and Java code via the \"source\" parameter in a _search request. The vulnerability is significant if Elasticsearch is not run in a separate virtual machine, as it can lead to unauthorized access and control over the server. Exploiting this vulnerability does not require authentication, making it relatively easy for attackers to execute remote code on the server. The vulnerability affects confidentiality and integrity, but not availability. It is crucial to upgrade to Elasticsearch version 1.2.0 or later, where dynamic scripting is disabled by default, or to manually disable dynamic scripting in earlier versions to mitigate this risk.",
