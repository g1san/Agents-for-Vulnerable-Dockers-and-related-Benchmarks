    "desc": "CVE-2023-26031 is a privilege escalation vulnerability found in Apache Hadoop's YARN container-executor binary on Linux systems. This vulnerability affects versions 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 of Apache Hadoop. The issue arises due to the relative library resolution in the container-executor binary, which allows local users to gain root privileges. Specifically, a user with limited privileges can install a malicious libcrypto library in a writable path, execute the container-executor command, and have their modified library run with root privileges. This is particularly concerning if the YARN cluster accepts work from remote authenticated users, as it may allow them to gain root privileges if their jobs are executed on the physical host. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.3.5 by reverting the library loading path change. Users can identify vulnerable versions by checking the RUNPATH or RPATH values of the container-executor binary using the readelf command. A vulnerable setup will show ../lib/native/ in the path and requires the container-executor to be owned by root with the suid bit set.",
