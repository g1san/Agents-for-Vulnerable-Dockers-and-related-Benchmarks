    "desc": "CVE-2019-3396 is a critical server-side template injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, specifically within the Widget Connector macro. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to perform path traversal and execute arbitrary code on the server via the `/rest/tinymce/1/macro/preview` endpoint. The flaw occurs due to insufficient validation of user input, which allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that includes a template path pointing to a file with malicious code. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected system. Affected versions include all versions before 6.6.12, versions 6.7.0 to 6.12.2, 6.13.0 to 6.13.2, and 6.14.0 to 6.14.1. The vulnerability is resolved in versions 6.6.12, 6.12.3, 6.13.3, 6.14.2, and 6.15.1.",
