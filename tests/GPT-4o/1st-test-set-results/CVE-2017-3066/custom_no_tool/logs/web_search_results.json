    "desc": "CVE-2017-3066 is a critical vulnerability found in Adobe ColdFusion, specifically due to a Java deserialization flaw within the Apache BlazeDS library used by ColdFusion for handling AMF (Action Message Format) serialization. The vulnerability arises because ColdFusion did not implement class whitelisting, allowing any class in the classpath that conforms to Java Beans Convention or implements `java.io.Externalizable` to be deserialized. This flaw can be exploited through the deserialization of untrusted data, potentially leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects Adobe ColdFusion 2016 Update 3 and earlier, ColdFusion 11 Update 11 and earlier, and ColdFusion 10 Update 22 and earlier. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require authentication and can be performed remotely, posing a significant risk to systems that have not been patched. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its high severity. Mitigation involves applying Adobe's security hotfixes and updating the Apache BlazeDS library to versions that include validation measures to prevent such deserialization attacks.",
