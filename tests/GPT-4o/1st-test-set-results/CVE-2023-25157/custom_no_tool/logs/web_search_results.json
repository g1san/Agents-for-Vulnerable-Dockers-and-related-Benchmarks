{
    "desc": "CVE-2023-25157 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in GeoServer, an open-source Java-based software server for sharing and editing geospatial data. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious SQL payloads into the CQL_FILTER parameter of requests sent to GeoServer, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and service disruption. The vulnerability affects GeoServer's support for OGC Filter expressions and the OGC Common Query Language (CQL) within the Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS) protocols. It is particularly prevalent when using PostGIS or Oracle DataStores, especially when prepared statements are disabled or encode functions are enabled. Affected versions of GeoServer are those below 2.21.4 and 2.22.2. Mitigation involves upgrading to patched versions or adjusting database settings to use parameterized queries and escape potentially dangerous characters.",
