    "desc": "CVE-2016-9086 is a vulnerability in GitLab, specifically affecting versions 8.9.0 through 8.13.2. This vulnerability arises from the 'import/export project' feature, which does not adequately check for symbolic links in user-provided archives. An authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw to perform arbitrary file reads on the server. By creating a specially crafted archive, an attacker can use symbolic links to point to sensitive files, such as '/etc/passwd'. When GitLab processes these archives, it reads the linked files, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. This vulnerability allows attackers to access any file readable by the GitLab service account, potentially exposing secret tokens and other critical information. The issue was mitigated by removing symbolic links from import packages and redirecting error outputs to logs instead of displaying them on the frontend.",
