    "desc": "CVE-2015-5254 is a critical vulnerability found in Apache ActiveMQ, a popular message broker. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of serialized Java objects, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of restrictions on the classes that can be deserialized by the ActiveMQ broker. An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java Message Service (JMS) ObjectMessage object through the ActiveMQ OpenWire transport protocol, typically on port 61616. When the server processes this serialized data, it can lead to unauthorized command execution, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it can be exploited remotely without requiring authentication, making it easy for attackers to compromise vulnerable systems. The issue was present in Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.x before 5.13.0 and was addressed in versions 5.11.3 and 5.12.2.",
