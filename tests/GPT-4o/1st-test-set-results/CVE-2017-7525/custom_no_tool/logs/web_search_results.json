{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-7525 is a security vulnerability found in the Jackson Databind library, which is used to process JSON data in Java applications. The vulnerability arises from the unsafe deserialization of data, where the library does not adequately restrict the classes that can be deserialized. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted JSON input. The issue is particularly concerning for applications that accept serialized data from untrusted sources, as it can lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability is associated with the handling of polymorphic types and is triggered if the application uses the default typing feature without proper restrictions. It affects Jackson Databind versions before 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1, and 2.8.9. To mitigate this vulnerability, upgrading to version 2.10.0 or later is recommended, or disabling default typing and implementing a custom TypeResolverBuilder.",
