    "desc": "CVE-2016-1898 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg, a multimedia framework used for processing video and audio files. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of input data, specifically when handling certain inputs. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially allow remote code execution. The issue affects multiple versions of FFmpeg and is related to the subfile protocol used within an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file. This allows remote attackers to perform cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files by including an arbitrary line from a local file in the URL string of an external HTTP request. The vulnerability can also enable arbitrary file reading and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), allowing attackers to access sensitive information or interact with internal systems. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically need to have the ability to upload or provide a file to be processed by FFmpeg.",
