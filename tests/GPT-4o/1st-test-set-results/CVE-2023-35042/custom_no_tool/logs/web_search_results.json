    "desc": "CVE-2023-35042 is a critical vulnerability in GeoServer 2 that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability arises from improper control of code generation in the Jiffle map algebra language provided by the jai-ext library. The vulnerability can be exploited through the `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec` method in `wps:LiteralData` within a `wps:Execute` request. The issue is particularly concerning as Jiffle is embedded in GeoServer's base WAR package, making it accessible through OGC requests and the administration console. Affected versions include those before 2.18.6, between 2.19.0 and 2.19.6, and between 2.20.0 and 2.20.4. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its high severity, with potential impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Mitigation involves removing the `janino-<version>.jar` from GeoServer's `WEB-INF/lib` directory to disable Jiffle's Java code compilation capability.",
