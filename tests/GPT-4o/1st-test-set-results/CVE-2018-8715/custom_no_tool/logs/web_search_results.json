    "desc": "CVE-2018-8715 is a high-severity vulnerability that affects the Embedthis HTTP library and AppWeb versions prior to 7.0.3. The vulnerability is due to a logic flaw in the authCondition function within the http/httpLib.c file. This flaw allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms for form and digest login types by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. The vulnerability is characterized by a CVSS score of 8.1, indicating significant impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is classified under CWE-287, which refers to improper authentication, where the product does not adequately verify identity claims. The vulnerability can be exploited over a network without requiring any privileges or user interaction, making it relatively accessible to potential attackers.",
