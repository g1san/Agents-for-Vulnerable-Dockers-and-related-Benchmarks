    "desc": "CVE-2025-23211 is a critical vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes application, which is an open-source tool for managing recipes, planning meals, and building shopping lists. The vulnerability arises from a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) flaw in the Jinja2 template engine. It affects versions of Tandoor Recipes up to and including 1.5.23. The root cause of the vulnerability is improper handling of user-supplied input in Jinja2 templates, specifically in the `recipes/cookbook/helper/template_helper.py` file. This flaw allows any user to execute arbitrary commands on the server. When the application is run using the default Docker Compose setup, these commands can execute with root privileges, leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is highly severe with a CVSS score of 10.0, as it requires no user interaction, has low complexity, and can be executed over a network. Exploiting this vulnerability can result in remote code execution, potentially compromising sensitive data and affecting system integrity. The issue has been patched in version 1.5.24, and users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to mitigate the risk.",
