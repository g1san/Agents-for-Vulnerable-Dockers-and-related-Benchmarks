    "desc": "CVE-2020-17526 is a vulnerability in Apache Airflow, an open-source platform for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The vulnerability arises due to a security misconfiguration where the web interface of Apache Airflow uses Flask's stateless, signed cookies for authentication with a default signing key \"temporary_key\". If this key is unchanged, it allows attackers to forge session cookies and impersonate users, including administrators, by replaying the session cookie. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as environment variables, execution of queries, and viewing of logs and source code of workflows. The vulnerability can also result in code execution on the server and potentially compromise cloud credentials if the server is cloud-based. The issue affects versions prior to 1.10.14 and was resolved in versions 1.10.15 and 2.0.2 by replacing the static key with a randomly generated one. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to upgrade to the fixed versions, change the default signing key, and implement additional security measures like restricting access and monitoring cloud environments.",
