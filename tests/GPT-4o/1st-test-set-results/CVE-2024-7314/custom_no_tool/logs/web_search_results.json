    "desc": "CVE-2024-7314 is a critical vulnerability found in anji-plus AJ-Report, specifically affecting versions prior to 1.4.1. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication by appending \";swagger-ui\" to HTTP requests. This bypass enables the execution of arbitrary Java code on the victim server, leading to potential remote code execution. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating high severity due to its low complexity, the lack of required privileges, and no need for user interaction. The flaw is associated with CWE-280 and CWE-288, which relate to improper handling of insufficient permissions and authentication bypass using an alternate path. Given its high severity and the ease of exploitation, the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited is significant, with an EPSS score of 68.716%.",
