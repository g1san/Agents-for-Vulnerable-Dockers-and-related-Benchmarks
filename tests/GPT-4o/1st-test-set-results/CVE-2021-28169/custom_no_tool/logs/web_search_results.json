    "desc": "CVE-2021-28169 is a vulnerability in Eclipse Jetty's ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter, affecting versions up to 9.4.40, 10.0.2, and 11.0.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to protected resources within the WEB-INF directory by exploiting a double decoding flaw. Specifically, a request to the ConcatServlet with a doubly encoded URI can bypass security checks and retrieve sensitive files like web.xml. This occurs because both ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter decode the supplied path to ensure it is not within restricted directories, then use this decoded path with RequestDispatcher, which performs a second decoding. This flaw has a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating a moderate severity level, with a network attack vector and low attack complexity, requiring no privileges or user interaction. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory by exploiting doubly encoded paths in requests to the ConcatServlet, leading to the exposure of sensitive information about a web application's implementation.",
