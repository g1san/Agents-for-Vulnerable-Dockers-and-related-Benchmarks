{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-18925 is a critical security vulnerability in Gogs, a self-hosted Git service, which allows for remote code execution. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of session IDs within the session management system of the Macaron framework, specifically in the go-macaron/session library. This flaw enables directory traversal through session files, allowing attackers to manipulate session data and gain unauthorized access to any account, including admin accounts. Once authenticated, attackers can exploit Git hooks to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is present in Gogs version 0.11.66 and earlier, and requires an attacker to upload a specially crafted file to exploit the session management flaw and achieve remote code execution.",
