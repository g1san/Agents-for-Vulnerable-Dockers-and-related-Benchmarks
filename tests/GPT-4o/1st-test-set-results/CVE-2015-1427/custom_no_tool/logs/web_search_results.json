    "desc": "CVE-2015-1427 is a critical vulnerability in Elasticsearch, a popular search and analytics engine, due to a flaw in its Groovy scripting engine. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted scripts to the Elasticsearch server. The issue arises from the dynamic scripting feature, which is enabled by default, and the inability of the sandbox to properly restrict Groovy code execution. As a result, attackers can bypass the sandbox using techniques like `java.lang.Math.class.forName` to execute arbitrary Java code, leading to unauthorized access and control over the affected system. The vulnerability affects Elasticsearch versions 1.3.0 to 1.3.7 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.2, and it is crucial to upgrade to version 1.3.8 or 1.4.3 or later to mitigate the risk. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because the REST API, which is vulnerable, does not require authentication and is commonly exposed to the internet, making exploitation easier for attackers.",
