# CVE-2015-1427 Vulnerable Environment

This setup uses Docker to create an environment vulnerable to CVE-2015-1427, a remote code execution vulnerability in Elasticsearch.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Run the following command to start the environment:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. The Elasticsearch service will be available at `http://localhost:9200`.

## Exploitation

The vulnerability can be tested by sending a crafted script to the Elasticsearch server. This setup is intended for educational and testing purposes only.

## Note

- This environment is intentionally vulnerable. Do not expose it to untrusted networks.
- Dynamic scripting is enabled to demonstrate the vulnerability. In a production environment, this feature should be disabled or properly secured.
