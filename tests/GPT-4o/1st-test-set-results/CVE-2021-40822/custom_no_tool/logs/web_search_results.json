{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-40822 is a high-severity Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in GeoServer, specifically within the TestWfsPost functionality. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate server requests to unintended destinations, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure. The issue arises from the feature that allows setting a proxy host in GeoServer, enabling attackers to send arbitrary requests to conduct lookups on internal networks that are otherwise inaccessible externally. This vulnerability affects GeoServer versions through 2.18.5 and 2.19.x up to 2.19.2. It has been addressed in GeoServer versions 2.25.2 and 2.24.4 by replacing the TestWfsPost servlet with a more secure JavaScript-based demo page.",
