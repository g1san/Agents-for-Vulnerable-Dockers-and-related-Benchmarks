{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-40438 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server, specifically affecting versions 2.4.48 and earlier. The flaw resides in the mod_proxy module, which, when enabled, allows a crafted request to cause the server to forward requests to an arbitrary origin server. This Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to manipulate the server into sending requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal systems or services. The vulnerability requires the Apache HTTP Server to be configured as a forward proxy, which is not the default configuration. It allows attackers to potentially exfiltrate secrets or access internal servers, and has been observed in exploit attempts, though widespread attacks have not been confirmed. Apache released version 2.4.49 to address this issue, and users are advised to upgrade to mitigate risk.",
