{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-6920 is a critical vulnerability within Drupal Core 8 that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server running vulnerable versions of the software. The issue arises from improper handling of YAML parsing, specifically due to unsafe deserialization of PHP objects using the PECL YAML parser. This vulnerability affects Drupal versions 8.0.0 to 8.3.3, and is exploited by crafting a payload that utilizes the YAML !php/object tag. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability by registering accounts on a Drupal site and injecting malicious code, which is then executed when the yaml_parse() function processes the untrusted input. This vulnerability is part of the SA-CORE-2017-003 advisory and was addressed in Drupal version 8.3.4 by disabling the deserialization of !php/object tags.",
