    "desc": "CVE-2021-26120 is a critical vulnerability found in Smarty, a popular PHP template engine. This vulnerability arises from improper input handling, specifically involving the injection of arbitrary code through unexpected function names following a \"{function name=\" substring. The vulnerability affects Smarty versions prior to 3.1.39. Exploitation of this flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where Smarty is used, leading to potential compromise of the entire system. This includes the ability to steal sensitive information, modify protected files, and deny access to resources. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network without requiring special access conditions or user interaction, making it particularly dangerous. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to upgrade to Smarty version 3.1.39 or later, which includes patches to prevent such code injection attacks.",
