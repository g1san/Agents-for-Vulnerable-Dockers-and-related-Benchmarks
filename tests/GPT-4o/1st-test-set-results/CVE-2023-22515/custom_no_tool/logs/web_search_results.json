{
    "desc": "CVE-2023-22515 is a critical broken access control vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server. This vulnerability allows external attackers to create unauthorized administrator accounts and gain access to Confluence instances. The vulnerability affects versions 8.0.0 to 8.5.1, excluding versions prior to 8.0.0. The issue is being actively exploited by a nation-state actor, which makes it particularly dangerous. Attackers can gain full administrative access, potentially exfiltrating content and system credentials. Immediate action is required to mitigate the risk, including upgrading to fixed versions 8.3.3, 8.4.3, or 8.5.2 or later, or applying interim measures such as blocking access to the /setup/* endpoints. Evidence of compromise includes unexpected administrator accounts and plugins.",
