    "desc": "CVE-2023-39141 is a path traversal vulnerability that affects the webui-aria2 project, specifically in its node-server.js component. This vulnerability arises from improper validation of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by sending a crafted request. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require any user interaction or privileges to be exploited. It allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended serving path, such as the '/etc/passwd' file, which can lead to system compromise. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5, indicating high severity, primarily impacting confidentiality. All versions of webui-aria2, up to the latest commit 4fe2e, are vulnerable, and no official fix or patch is available yet.",
