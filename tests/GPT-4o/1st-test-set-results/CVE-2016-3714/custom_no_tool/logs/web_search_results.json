    "desc": "CVE-2016-3714 is a critical vulnerability in ImageMagick, a widely used image processing library. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server through the upload of a maliciously crafted image file. The issue arises from ImageMagick's improper validation of input data, which permits the injection and execution of shell commands via the 'delegate' feature. This feature uses external libraries for processing file formats like SVG and MVG, enabling command injection when handling these image types. The vulnerability, disclosed by Nikolay Ermishkin from the Mail.Ru Security Team, affects versions of ImageMagick before 6.9.3-10 and 7.0.1-1. Despite a fix being released, it was initially incomplete, prompting further patches and mitigations such as disabling vulnerable coders and verifying image file types. The vulnerability is also known as 'ImageTragick' and impacts libraries dependent on ImageMagick, such as PHP\u2019s imagick and Ruby\u2019s rmagick.",
