    "desc": "CVE-2023-22527 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that affects older versions of Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server. This vulnerability is due to a template injection flaw that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The vulnerability impacts versions 8.0.x through 8.4.x and 8.5.0-8.5.3, released before December 5, 2023. It does not affect 7.19.x LTS versions. The vulnerability is critical, with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating the high severity of the issue. The only remediation is to update to versions such as 8.5.4 (LTS) or higher, as there are no known workarounds. The vulnerability was discovered by Petrus Viet and reported through Atlassian's Bug Bounty program. Users of Atlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this issue.",
