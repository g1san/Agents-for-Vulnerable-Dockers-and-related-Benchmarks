    "desc": "CVE-2016-1897 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg, an open-source software for handling multimedia files. The vulnerability is related to the improper handling of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) m3u8 files, which can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and arbitrary file read vulnerabilities. This issue arises because FFmpeg does not validate the stream addresses in m3u8 files, allowing attackers to craft malicious m3u8 files that cause FFmpeg to make unauthorized HTTP requests or read local files. The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions 2.8.x < 2.8.5, 2.7.x < 2.7.5, 2.6.x < 2.6.7, and 2.5.x < 2.5.10. Exploitation occurs when a website permits multimedia file uploads processed by FFmpeg, allowing crafted m3u8 files to trigger the vulnerability. The issue was fixed in FFmpeg version 2.8.5 by implementing stricter input validation to prevent buffer overflows and unauthorized data access.",
