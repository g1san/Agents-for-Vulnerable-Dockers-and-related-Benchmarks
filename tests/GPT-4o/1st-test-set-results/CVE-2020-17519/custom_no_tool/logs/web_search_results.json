{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-17519 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Apache Flink, affecting versions 1.11.0 to 1.11.2. This security flaw exists in the RESTful API of Apache Flink's JobManager, where improper access control and validation of file paths allow attackers to read arbitrary files on the system hosting the JobManager. The vulnerability is due to inadequate handling of URLs and file paths, permitting attackers to traverse directories and access sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication, making it particularly severe. It has been addressed in Apache Flink version 1.11.3 and later.",
