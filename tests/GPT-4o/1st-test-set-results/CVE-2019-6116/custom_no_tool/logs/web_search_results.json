    "desc": "CVE-2019-6116 is a critical vulnerability found in Ghostscript, a suite for processing PostScript and PDF files. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The issue arises due to improper handling of certain PostScript commands, which can be exploited by sending a specially crafted file to a service using Ghostscript. This file, when processed, can execute malicious code by bypassing security restrictions. The flaw is associated with the misuse of protected functions within Ghostscript's pseudo-operators, enabling attackers to bypass the security sandbox and execute arbitrary commands or read arbitrary files. The vulnerability affects Ghostscript versions through 9.26, and it has been addressed in later versions. This flaw is critical as it can lead to unauthorized access and control over the system where Ghostscript is used, impacting applications that rely on Ghostscript, such as ImageMagick and Python libraries like matplotlib.",
