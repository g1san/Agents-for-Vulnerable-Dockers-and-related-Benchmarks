    "desc": "CVE-2018-15685 is a remote code execution vulnerability discovered in the Electron framework, affecting specific versions (1.7.15, 1.8.7, 2.0.7, and 3.0.0-beta.6). The vulnerability arises from insecure default settings in applications that can open nested child windows, particularly when using IFRAME elements with the \"nativeWindowOpen: true\" or \"sandbox: true\" options. This issue occurs because properties are not properly inherited through nested windows and iframes, causing them to fall back to insecure defaults, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting these settings. The primary cause is the lack of isolation between the window and Node.js, which can be mitigated by setting \"contextIsolation\" to true and \"nodeIntegration\" to false. The Electron team released patches in subsequent versions to address this vulnerability.",
