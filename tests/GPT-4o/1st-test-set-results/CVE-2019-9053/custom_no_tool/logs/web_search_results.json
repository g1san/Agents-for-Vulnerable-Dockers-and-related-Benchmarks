    "desc": "CVE-2019-9053 is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability found in CMS Made Simple versions up to 2.2.9. This vulnerability arises from improper input validation in the News module, specifically in the handling of the 'idlist' parameter. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability using time-based blind SQL injection techniques to extract sensitive information such as admin credentials.
