    "desc": "CVE-2023-51449 is a path traversal vulnerability found in Gradio versions 4.0 through 4.10. This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files from a server hosting Gradio, including sensitive environment variables, by exploiting the file endpoint. The flaw lies in the inadequate check for file paths, allowing traversal using sequences like '../'. This vulnerability was introduced as a regression in version 4.0 and affects applications hosted on Hugging Face Spaces and self-hosted Gradio instances. It also allows for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, enabling unauthorized local file inclusion (LFI) without authentication. The vulnerability has been addressed in Gradio version 4.11.0 and has a high severity with a CVSS score of 8.6, due to its significant potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
