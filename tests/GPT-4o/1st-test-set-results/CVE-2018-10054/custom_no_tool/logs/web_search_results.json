    "desc": "CVE-2018-10054 is a critical security vulnerability present in the H2 database engine. This vulnerability is categorized as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) issue, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Java code on the affected system. The root cause of this vulnerability is the misuse of the CREATE ALIAS functionality in the H2 database. This feature can be exploited when the H2 web console is accessible without a password and is open to connections beyond localhost, which is a common setup during development. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it allows attackers on the same network to potentially access and execute code on the developer's system through a web browser. The vulnerability affects version 1.4.197 of the H2 database. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to configure the H2 web console with a strong password and restrict access to localhost. Additionally, implementing a filter to enforce localhost-only access can help prevent unauthorized code execution. The issue emphasizes the importance of securing the H2 web console by default to prevent exploitation.",
