    "desc": "CVE-2017-1000353 is a critical security vulnerability in Jenkins, an open-source automation server. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of serialized Java objects in the Jenkins Command Line Interface (CLI). Specifically, it allows attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` to the Jenkins CLI, which is deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`. This bypasses existing blacklist-based security mechanisms, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely without authentication. The vulnerability affects all Jenkins mainline releases up to version 2.56 and Long-Term Support (LTS) releases up to version 2.46.1. To mitigate this issue, the `SignedObject` has been added to the remoting blocklist, and a new HTTP-based CLI protocol has been introduced to replace the vulnerable remoting-based protocol. The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to Jenkins projects and execute arbitrary commands, posing a significant risk to the security and integrity of systems using Jenkins for automation tasks.",
