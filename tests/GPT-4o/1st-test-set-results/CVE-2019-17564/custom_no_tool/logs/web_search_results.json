    "desc": "CVE-2019-17564 is a vulnerability found in Apache Dubbo, a high-performance Java-based remote procedure call (RPC) framework. The issue arises from Apache Dubbo's handling of HTTP protocol communications, specifically when deserializing data from POST requests. Versions affected include 2.5.x, 2.6.0 to 2.6.7, and 2.7.0 to 2.7.4.1. The vulnerability is due to the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands. This occurs when an attacker sends a POST request containing a malicious Java object to a Dubbo Provider instance. The deserialization process, if not properly secured, can lead to remote code execution by leveraging a malicious gadget chain. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-502, which pertains to deserialization of untrusted data, and is considered critical due to the potential for full system compromise. Mitigation involves upgrading to version 2.7.5 or later, or disabling the HTTP protocol to prevent exploitation.",
