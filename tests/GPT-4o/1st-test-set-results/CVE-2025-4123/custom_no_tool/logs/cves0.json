      "description": "### Summary\n\nUnclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens.\n\n### Fix\n\nWe have back-ported the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release.\n\n### Workaround \n\nWe are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.\n\n```Go\ntoken, err := /* jwt.Parse or similar */\nif token.Valid {\n\tfmt.Println(\"You look nice today\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenMalformed) {\n\tfmt.Println(\"That's not even a token\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenUnverifiable) {\n\tfmt.Println(\"We could not verify this token\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid) {\n\tfmt.Println(\"This token has an invalid signature\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenExpired) || errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenNotValidYet) {\n\t// Token is either expired or not active yet\n\tfmt.Println(\"Timing is everything\")\n} else {\n\tfmt.Println(\"Couldn't handle this token:\", err)\n}\n```",

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\r\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\r\nend user applications.\r\n\r\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\r\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\r\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\r\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\r\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\r\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\r\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\r\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\r\nlikely result in a crash.\r\n\r\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\r\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\r\nthe BIO.

      "description": "The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming\r\nASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\r\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\r\nend user applications.\r\n\r\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\r\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\r\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\r\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\r\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\r\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\r\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\r\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\r\nlikely result in a crash.\r\n\r\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\r\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\r\nthe BIO.

      "description": "### Summary\n\nTerrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or server noticing it.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.\n\n**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.** \n\nAs a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.\n\n### Details\n\nThe SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.\n\nThe attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.\n\nIn the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.\n\nFor more details see [https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com). \n\n### Impact\n\nThis attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.",

This cache is used in both happy and unhappy scenarios in order to limit side channel attacks that could tell an attacker if a user is present in the file or not.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe exporter-toolkit v0.7.3 and v0.8.2 have been released to address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround but attacker must have access to the hashed password, stored in disk, to bypass the authentication.\n\n### Credit\n\nWe want to thank Lei Wan reporting this security issue.\n",

Since the parser is, by design, exposed to untrusted user input, this can be leveraged to force a program to consume significant time parsing Accept-Language headers. The parser cannot be easily rewritten to fix this behavior for various reasons. Instead the solution implemented in this CL is to limit the total complexity of tags passed into ParseAcceptLanguage by limiting the number of dashes in the string to 1000. This should be more than enough for the majority of real world use cases, where the number of tags being sent is likely to be in the single digits.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngolang.org/x/text/language",

      "description": "A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart.\n\nMultipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue.\n\nReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files.\n\nWith fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous.\n\nIn addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct.\n\nUsers should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.",

      "description": "Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts.\n\nThis stems from several causes:\n\n1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended.\n2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts.\n3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector.\n\nThe combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue.\n\nWith fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations.\n\nIn addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms:\n\n1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=.\n2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts.

      "description": "A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing.\n\nWith the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection.\n\nThis issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2.\n\nThe default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",

For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x.\n\nBefore fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. Clean will now convert this to .\\??\\b.\n\nSimilarly, Join(\\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \\??\\b.

      "description": "### Summary\n\nWhen validating a request with a multipart/form-data schema, if the OpenAPI schema allows it, an attacker can upload a crafted ZIP file (e.g., a ZIP bomb), causing the server to consume all available system memory.\n\n### Details\n\nThe root cause comes from the [ZipFileBodyDecoder](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/blob/6da871e0e170b7637eb568c265c08bc2b5d6e7a3/openapi3filter/req_resp_decoder.go#L1523), which is registered [automatically](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/blob/6da871e0e170b7637eb568c265c08bc2b5d6e7a3/openapi3filter/req_resp_decoder.go#L1275) by the module (contrary to what the [documentation says](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-content-type-for-body-of-http-requestresponse).\n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce the vulnerability, you can use the following OpenAPI schema:\n```yaml\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: 'Validator'\n  version: 0.0.1\npaths:\n  /:\n    post:\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          multipart/form-data:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              required:\n                - file\n              properties:\n                file:\n                  type: string\n                  format: binary\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Created\n```\nAnd this code to validate the request (nothing fancy, it basically only calls the `openapi3filter.ValidateRequest` function`):\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\n\t\"github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3filter\"\n\tlegacyrouter \"github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/routers/legacy\"\n\n\t\"github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3\"\n)\n\nfunc handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tloader := openapi3.NewLoader()\n\n\tdoc, err := loader.LoadFromFile(\"schema.yaml\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Failed to load OpenAPI document\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tif err := doc.Validate(r.Context()); err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Invalid OpenAPI document\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\trouter, err := legacyrouter.NewRouter(doc)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Failed to create router\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\troute, pathParams, err := router.FindRoute(r)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, \"Failed to find route\", http.StatusNotFound)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tinput := &openapi3filter.RequestValidationInput{\n\t\tRequest:     r,\n\t\tQueryParams: r.URL.Query(),\n\t\tRoute:       route,\n\t\tPathParams:  pathParams,\n\t}\n\n\tif err := openapi3filter.ValidateRequest(r.Context(), input); err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf(\"Request validation failed: %v\", err), http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tw.Write([]byte(\"request ok !\"))\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", handler)\n\tlog.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil))\n\n}\n```\n\nWe also need to create a zip bomb. This command will create a 4.7GB file and compress it to to 4.7MB zip archive:\n```shell\nperl -e 'print \"0\" x 5000000000' > /tmp/bigfile.txt; zip -9 /tmp/bomb.zip /tmp/bigfile.txt\n```\n\nRun the PoC provided, and upload the zip bomb with `curl localhost:8080/  -F file=\"@/tmp/bomb.zip;type=application/zip\" -v`.\n\nObserve the memory consumption of the test server during and after the upload (it jumped to a bit over 22GB in my testing, with only a 4.7MB input file, you can reduce the size of the generated file to not kill your test machine when reproducing.) \n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition, leading to server crashes or degraded performance.\nIt seems to only be exploitable if the OpenAPI schema allows for multipart upload.\n\n### Remediation\n\nI see at least 2 potential fixes/improvements:\n - Do not register by default the zip file decoder (I honestly was a bit surprised to see it was enabled by default, it seems to be quite a niche use-case ?)\n - Update `ZipFileBodyDecoder` to enforce a maximum size of the decompressed archive and bailout as soon as it's reached (probably with a small default value and allow the users to configure it through the input options ?)",

If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template.\n\nAs ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml.\n\nWith fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.\n\nUsers who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.",
