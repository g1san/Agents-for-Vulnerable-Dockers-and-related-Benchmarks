    "desc": "CVE-2016-5385, also known as the \"httpoxy\" vulnerability, affects web applications running in CGI or CGI-like contexts, including those using PHP, Go, Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, HHVM, and Python. The vulnerability arises from a namespace conflict where the HTTP Proxy header from a request is placed into environment variables as HTTP_PROXY. This variable is commonly used to configure outgoing proxies, leading to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If a web server, programming language, or framework sets the HTTP_PROXY environment variable from user-supplied requests and uses it unsafely, an attacker can conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on internal subrequests or direct the server to connect to arbitrary hosts. The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction or privileges, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system. To mitigate the issue, it is recommended to block Proxy request headers before they reach the application.",
