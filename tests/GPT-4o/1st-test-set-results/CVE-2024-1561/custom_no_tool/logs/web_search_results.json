{
    "desc": "CVE-2024-1561 is a high-severity vulnerability in the Gradio framework, which is used for developing and sharing AI/ML demos. This vulnerability arises from an input validation flaw in the `component_server` API endpoint, allowing attackers to invoke internal Python backend functions. The flaw specifically allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with attacker-controlled arguments. By exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and retrieve it. This results in unauthorized local file read access. The risk is particularly severe when the application is exposed to the internet using `launch(share=True)`, as it allows remote attackers to access files on the host machine. Gradio applications hosted on platforms like huggingface.co are also affected, potentially exposing sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables. The vulnerability affects Gradio versions 3.47 to 4.12 and has been patched in version 4.13.0. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating its severity.",
