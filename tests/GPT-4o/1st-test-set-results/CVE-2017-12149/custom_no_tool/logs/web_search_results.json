    "desc": "CVE-2017-12149 is a critical vulnerability found in the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) and JBoss SOA Platform (SOA-P). It arises from insecure deserialization in the doFilter() method of the ReadOnlyAccessFilter in the HTTP Invoker. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to potential unauthorized access or control of the affected system. The flaw can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests that are improperly handled by the server, allowing remote code execution (RCE). This issue impacts the server's ability to manage HTTP requests securely, making it crucial for users to apply necessary patches or updates to mitigate the risk. The vulnerability affects JBoss EAP versions 5.x and SOA-P 5.3.0, and can be exploited without authentication, posing significant security risks.",
