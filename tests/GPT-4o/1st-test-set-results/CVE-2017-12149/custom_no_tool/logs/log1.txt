#6 0.470 
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470  One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown),
#6 0.470  and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
#6 0.470  safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470      1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470      2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
#6 0.470         upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
#6 0.470         distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
#6 0.470         packages for the previous distribution release still work).
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470      3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled
#6 0.470             yum --disablerepo=<repoid> ...
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470      4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum
#6 0.470         will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it
#6 0.470         again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470             yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>
#6 0.470         or
#6 0.470             subscription-manager repos --disable=<repoid>
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470      5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
#6 0.470         Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
#6 0.470         so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
#6 0.470         slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
#6 0.470         compromise:
#6 0.470 
#6 0.470             yum-config-manager --save --setopt=<repoid>.skip_if_unavailable=true
#6 0.470
