{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-1000861 is a critical vulnerability in Jenkins, a popular open-source automation server, specifically within its Stapler web framework. This vulnerability arises due to the reflective access to code elements based on naming conventions, which can be exploited via crafted URLs. Attackers can invoke methods not intended for public access, leading to unauthorized actions. Unauthenticated users can invalidate sessions, and users with minimal permissions can create new user objects or trigger periodic tasks. The vulnerability affects Jenkins versions up to 2.153 and LTS 2.138.3. It has been patched in Jenkins 2.154 and LTS 2.138.4 or 2.150.1 by restricting method and field access in Stapler. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise. It is actively exploited, as evidenced by its inclusion in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog and the Watchbog botnet's use for cryptocurrency mining. The attack involves sending a malicious payload to the Jenkins server, which can execute arbitrary shell commands or set up a reverse shell. This issue is classified under CWE-502, indicating deserialization of untrusted data, and has a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, highlighting its severity.",
