    "desc": "CVE-2022-23221 is a critical security vulnerability found in H2 Console versions prior to 2.1.210. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems. The exploitation occurs through a specially crafted JDBC URL containing the `IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT` substring. This specific configuration within the URL enables attackers to bypass certain restrictions and execute malicious scripts, leading to unauthorized code execution on the server hosting the H2 Console. This vulnerability is distinct from another similar vulnerability, CVE-2021-42392, affecting the same software.",
