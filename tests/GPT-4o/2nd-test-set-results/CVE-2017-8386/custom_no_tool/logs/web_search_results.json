    "desc": "CVE-2017-8386 is a vulnerability in the Git shell, a restricted shell used in Git remote sessions over SSH. The vulnerability arises from the ability to bypass command restrictions by abusing the interactive features of the `less` command, which is used to display Git's manual pages. By forcing the SSH client to allocate a pseudo-terminal (pty), users can run `less` in interactive mode and exploit its capabilities to execute system commands. This bypasses the shell's restrictions, allowing unauthorized access to system commands. The vulnerability can lead to sandbox bypass, arbitrary file reading, and potential arbitrary command execution. It is mitigated by updating to fixed Git versions and using SSH configuration options like `no-pty` to prevent pty allocation.",
