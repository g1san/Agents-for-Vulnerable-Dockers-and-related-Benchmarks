{
    "desc": "CVE-2015-5531 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch, affecting versions 1.0.0 through 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to access and read arbitrary files on the server that are accessible by the Elasticsearch JVM process. The attack exploits the snapshot API, which, if not properly secured, can be manipulated to traverse directories and read sensitive files. The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to Elasticsearch versions 1.6.1 or 1.7.0, or by implementing security measures such as firewalls, reverse proxies, or Elasticsearch Shield to block unauthorized snapshot API calls. The issue was reported by Benjamin Smith and has a CVSS score of 2.6, indicating a low severity but potentially significant impact if exploited.",
