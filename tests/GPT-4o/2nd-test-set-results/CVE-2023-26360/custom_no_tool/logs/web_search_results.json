    "desc": "CVE-2023-26360 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion, a web application development platform, identified as an improper access control issue that was later reclassified as a deserialization of untrusted data. This flaw allows unauthorized remote code execution when an attacker sends a specially crafted request with untrusted data to a ColdFusion server. The vulnerability is severe because it does not require user interaction, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an advisory about the active exploitation of this vulnerability, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature. An exploit script has been developed to demonstrate the vulnerability, allowing for remote file read or command execution against affected ColdFusion servers. Affected versions include ColdFusion 2018 Update 15 and earlier, and ColdFusion 2021 Update 5 and earlier. Users are advised to update to ColdFusion 2018 Update 16 and ColdFusion 2021 Update 6 to mitigate the risk.",
