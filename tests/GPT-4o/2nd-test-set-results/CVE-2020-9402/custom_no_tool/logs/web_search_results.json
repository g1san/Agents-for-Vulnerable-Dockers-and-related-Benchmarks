    "desc": "CVE-2020-9402 is a security vulnerability identified in certain versions of the Django web application framework, specifically affecting versions 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates when used with Oracle databases. This flaw can lead to a SQL injection attack, where an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the tolerance parameter, which is not adequately sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to view, modify, add, or delete information in the database, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation. The issue has been addressed in subsequent patches for the affected Django versions.",
