{
    "desc": "CVE-2025-1974 is a critical security vulnerability in the ingress-nginx component of Kubernetes, specifically affecting the Validating Admission Controller feature. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with access to the pod network to execute arbitrary code in the context of the ingress-nginx controller. This can potentially lead to the disclosure and exposure of all Secrets accessible to the controller, which includes cluster-wide Secrets by default. The vulnerability is part of a group of flaws known as \"IngressNightmare,\" which pose significant risks to Kubernetes environments by potentially allowing remote code execution. The vulnerability affects ingress-nginx versions below v1.11.0, between v1.11.0 and v1.11.4, and v1.12.0. It has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, indicating its high severity. Patching to Ingress NGINX Controller versions 1.12.1 and 1.11.5 is recommended, or disabling the Validating Admission Controller as a temporary mitigation.",
