    "desc": "CVE-2017-3066 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion versions 2016 Update 3 and earlier, ColdFusion 11 Update 11 and earlier, and ColdFusion 10 Update 22 and earlier. The vulnerability arises from a Java deserialization issue in the Apache BlazeDS library, which does not properly restrict the deserialization of untrusted data. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected systems if they can trick a user into opening a malicious file or visiting a compromised website containing a specially crafted Flash file. The vulnerability has a high CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to update to the latest versions of Adobe ColdFusion and apply the necessary security patches.",
