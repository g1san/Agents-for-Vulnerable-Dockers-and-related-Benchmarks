    "desc": "CVE-2020-14144 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting Gitea versions 1.1.0 through 1.12.5. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with permission to create Git hooks to execute arbitrary code on the server. The core issue stems from the improper neutralization of special elements used in operating system commands, leading to OS Command Injection (CWE-78). Users with valid credentials and appropriate permissions can exploit this vulnerability by creating a repository, navigating to the Git Hooks settings, and inserting a malicious shell script as a post-receive hook. This script is executed when a new commit is pushed, potentially allowing the attacker to execute code with the privileges of the Gitea user, which could compromise the entire system. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2, indicating significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The issue was mitigated in Gitea version 1.13.0 by disabling the Git hook creation feature by default. It is recommended to update to version 1.13.0 or later to avoid this vulnerability.",
