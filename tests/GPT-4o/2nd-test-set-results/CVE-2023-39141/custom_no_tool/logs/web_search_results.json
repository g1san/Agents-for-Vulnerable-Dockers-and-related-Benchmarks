    "desc": "CVE-2023-39141 is a high-severity path traversal vulnerability affecting the webui-aria2 project, an open-source web-based interface for the Aria2 download utility. The vulnerability exists in the 'node-server.js' file, where improper handling and sanitization of file names from URL inputs allow attackers to access files outside the intended serving directory. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, enabling attackers to read arbitrary files on the server, such as '/etc/passwd', without requiring user interaction or special privileges. The vulnerability affects all versions of webui-aria2 up to the latest commit '109903f0e2774cf948698cd95a01f77f33d7dd2c', and there is currently no fixed version available. The CVSS score is 7.5, indicating a significant impact on confidentiality, though integrity and availability are not affected. Users are advised to implement additional security measures to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",
