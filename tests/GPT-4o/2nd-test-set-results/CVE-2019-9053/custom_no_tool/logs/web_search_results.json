    "desc": "CVE-2019-9053 is a blind SQL injection vulnerability found in CMS Made Simple versions up to 2.2.9. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the system by extracting administrator credentials using time-based SQL injection techniques. The exploitation does not require authentication, making it particularly dangerous as it can be executed remotely without prior access to the system. The vulnerability is located in the News module of CMS Made Simple, where improper handling of the `idlist` parameter allows for SQL code injection. Attackers can manipulate the `m1_idlist` parameter in a URL to bypass filters and execute SQL injections. The flaw can be exploited to extract information such as password hashes, salts, usernames, and emails from the database, potentially leading to unauthorized access and remote code execution.",
