    "desc": "CVE-2020-17519 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Apache Flink, a framework for distributed stream and batch data processing. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of URL encoding and improper validation of user inputs, allowing attackers to access unauthorized directories and files on the server. This affects the JobManager's RESTful API, where the request handler permits direct access to file paths, enabling attackers to exploit the system by executing crafted requests. This vulnerability is present in Apache Flink versions 1.11.0 to 1.11.2, and it allows attackers to read any file accessible to the JobManager process through its REST interface. This flaw can lead to unauthorized access and control over the system, potentially compromising its confidentiality and integrity. The issue was resolved in Apache Flink version 1.11.3 and later.",
