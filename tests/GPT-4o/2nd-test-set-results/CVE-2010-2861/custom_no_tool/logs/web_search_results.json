    "desc": "CVE-2010-2861 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier versions. This vulnerability is located in the administrator console of ColdFusion, where the locale parameter in several CFIDE/administrator files, such as enter.cfm, settings/mappings.cfm, and others, can be exploited. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server. By using crafted URLs, remote attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files, such as the password.properties file, which contains password hashes. These hashes can then be used to authenticate as administrators without needing to crack them, allowing further unauthorized actions like creating scheduled tasks to download webshells and modify web application files. This vulnerability is classified under CWE-22, which involves improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, and has a high likelihood of exploitation, emphasizing the need for timely software updates and security measures like web application firewalls.",
