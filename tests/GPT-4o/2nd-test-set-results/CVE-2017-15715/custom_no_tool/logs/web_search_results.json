    "desc": "CVE-2017-15715 is a security vulnerability found in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.29. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of the '$' character in the <FilesMatch> directive. The '$' character is meant to match only the end of a filename, but in these affected versions, it can incorrectly match a newline character. This flaw allows attackers to bypass filename-based restrictions set by administrators, particularly in environments where file uploads are controlled by their filename extensions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can upload files with malicious content by appending a newline character, thus evading security checks that rely on the filename's trailing portion.",
