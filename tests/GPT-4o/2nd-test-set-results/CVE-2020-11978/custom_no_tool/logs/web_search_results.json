    "desc": "CVE-2020-11978 is a remote code execution vulnerability found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. The vulnerability is located in the example Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) included with Airflow. It arises from a command injection flaw that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands as the user running the Airflow worker or scheduler. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the open backend API, even if web UI authentication is configured, particularly when combined with CVE-2020-13927, which allows unauthenticated API requests by default. To mitigate this vulnerability, users should disable example DAGs by setting `load_examples=False` in the configuration or upgrade to Apache Airflow version 1.10.11 or later. Additionally, access to the experimental API should be denied by configuring the `auth_backend` in `airflow.cfg` to `airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all`.",
