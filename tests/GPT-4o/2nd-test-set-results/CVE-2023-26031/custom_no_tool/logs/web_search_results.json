    "desc": "CVE-2023-26031 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache Hadoop's YARN container-executor binary on Linux systems. The vulnerability affects versions 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 and arises due to relative library resolution, which allows a local user to gain root privileges by installing a malicious libcrypto library in a writable path. This can be exploited if the YARN cluster accepts work from remote authenticated users, potentially allowing them to gain root privileges when their jobs are executed on the physical host rather than in a container. The vulnerability was introduced by patch YARN-10495 and fixed in version 3.3.5 by reverting the change with patch YARN-11441. Affected installations must have the container-executor owned by root and the suid bit set to enable privilege escalation. Users can check for vulnerability by examining the RUNPATH or RPATH value in the container-executor using the readelf command.",
