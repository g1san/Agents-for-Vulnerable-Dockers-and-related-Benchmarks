    "desc": "CVE-2020-11981 is a critical command injection vulnerability found in Apache Airflow versions up to 1.10.10. This vulnerability arises from inadequate input sanitization in the web-based user interface, particularly when using the CeleryExecutor. It allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on worker nodes by sending specially crafted requests to the Airflow web server. This flaw is exacerbated if an attacker can directly connect to the broker, such as Redis or RabbitMQ, thereby injecting commands that result in the Celery worker executing arbitrary commands. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, highlighting its severity, as it can lead to unauthorized access, control over the server, exposure of sensitive data, or disruption of services. Users are advised to upgrade to Apache Airflow version 1.10.11 or later to mitigate this issue.",
