    "desc": "CVE-2019-6116 is a vulnerability in Ghostscript, a suite for processing PostScript and PDF files. This vulnerability arises due to improper handling of ephemeral or transient procedures, allowing attackers to bypass Ghostscript's security sandbox. This can enable arbitrary command execution and file reading on the affected system. The flaw allows attackers to supply a specially crafted file to a service utilizing Ghostscript for processing, potentially leading to unauthorized access or execution of malicious actions. Discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy, the issue affects Artifex Ghostscript through version 9.26, and was patched in version 9.27. Users are advised to apply necessary patches or mitigations to protect against potential exploitation, as Ghostscript is widely used in image processing applications like ImageMagick and Python-matplotlib.",
