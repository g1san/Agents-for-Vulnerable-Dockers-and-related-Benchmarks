    "desc": "CVE-2015-1427 is a vulnerability in Elasticsearch's Groovy scripting engine, affecting versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.7 and 1.4.0 through 1.4.2. This issue arises because the dynamic scripting feature is enabled by default, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server via crafted Groovy scripts. The vulnerability is located in the Elasticsearch REST API, which does not require authentication. Attackers can submit Groovy code through the _search API endpoint, exploiting the Groovy sandbox to execute arbitrary Java code by bypassing its restrictions using Java reflection techniques. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential control over the affected system. The vulnerability facilitates unauthenticated remote code execution, making it critical for users to upgrade to version 1.4.3 or later to mitigate the risk.",
