    "desc": "CVE-2020-13945 is a critical security vulnerability in Apache APISIX, specifically affecting versions 1.2 to 1.5. This vulnerability arises when the Admin API is enabled and the access IP restriction rules are deleted, allowing unauthorized access using the default token. The default token, \"edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1\", is defined in the configuration file. If the ip-restriction plugin is not enabled, any user can add routes, leading to remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting the script feature. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access and interact with the server as an administrator, potentially leading to a server takeover. To mitigate the risk, it is advised not to delete the Admin API access IP restriction rules, configure them to restrict access to trusted IPs only, and change the default token to a strong, unique one.",
