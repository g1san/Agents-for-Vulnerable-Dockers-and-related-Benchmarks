The vulnerability allows remote code execution due to the CREATE ALIAS feature, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary Java code. The vendor has stated that H2 is not intended to be used outside of a secure environment, implying that the vulnerability is a significant risk when the database is exposed to untrusted networks.",
