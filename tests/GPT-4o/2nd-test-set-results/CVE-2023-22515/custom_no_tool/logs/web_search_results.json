    "desc": "CVE-2023-22515 is a critical vulnerability in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center, categorized as a broken access control issue. This vulnerability affects versions 8.0.0 to 8.5.1 and allows unauthorized external attackers to create administrator accounts. It is remotely exploitable without authentication, primarily targeting publicly accessible instances. The vulnerability involves the /setup/* endpoints, and mitigation involves upgrading to fixed versions (8.3.3, 8.4.3, 8.5.2 or later) and blocking access to these endpoints. If exploited, attackers gain full administrative access, posing a significant risk of system compromise. Indicators of compromise include unexpected admin group members and new user accounts.",
