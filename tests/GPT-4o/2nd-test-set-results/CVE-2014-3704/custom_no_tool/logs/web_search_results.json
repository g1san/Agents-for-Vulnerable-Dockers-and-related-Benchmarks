    "desc": "CVE-2014-3704, also known as 'Drupageddon', is a critical vulnerability found in Drupal core versions 7.0 to 7.31. The vulnerability is located in the database abstraction API, specifically within the expandArguments function, which fails to properly construct prepared statements. This flaw allows remote attackers to exploit the system by sending specially crafted requests that lead to SQL injection attacks. Such attacks can be used to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify database records, or even compromise the entire application. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited remotely with low complexity and does not require prior authentication. Attackers can use this vulnerability to inject a new administrator user into the Drupal system, enabling them to log in and enable the PHP filter module, which permits the execution of embedded PHP code. This capability further allows the attacker to execute remote code on the target system. The vulnerability was disclosed in 2014 and is critical, requiring immediate patching to prevent exploitation.",
