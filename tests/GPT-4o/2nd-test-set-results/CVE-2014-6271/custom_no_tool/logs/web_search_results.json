    "desc": "CVE-2014-6271, commonly referred to as Shellshock, is a critical security vulnerability in the GNU Bash shell, predominantly found in Unix-based systems. The flaw is associated with how Bash processes environment variables that include function definitions. Specifically, Bash can execute arbitrary trailing commands following these function definitions due to improper handling. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when Bash is invoked via network-exposed services, such as web servers using CGI scripts, which can process user input through environment variables. The vulnerability affects Bash versions up to 4.3, and its exploitation can lead to remote code execution, posing significant security risks to affected systems.",
