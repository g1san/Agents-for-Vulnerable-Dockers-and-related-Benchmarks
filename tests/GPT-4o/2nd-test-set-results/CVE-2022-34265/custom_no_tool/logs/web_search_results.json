    "desc": "CVE-2022-34265 is a high-severity security vulnerability in Django, disclosed on July 5, 2022. It is a type of SQL injection vulnerability that affects Django versions 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6. The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of untrusted data in the Trunc() and Extract() database functions. Specifically, if an attacker can manipulate the request parameters in the 'kind' argument of Trunc or the 'lookup_name' argument of Extract, they can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even denial of service. The vulnerability was reported by Takuto Yoshikai and has been addressed in Django versions 3.2.14 and 4.0.6. Applications that restrict the kind and lookup_name to a safe list are not affected.",
