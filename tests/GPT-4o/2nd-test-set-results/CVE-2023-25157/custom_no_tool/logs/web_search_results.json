    "desc": "CVE-2023-25157 is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in GeoServer, an open-source server for sharing geospatial data. The vulnerability can be exploited using the OGC Filter SQL Injection method by injecting malicious payloads into the CQL_FILTER parameter. This flaw is present in GeoServer versions prior to 2.21.4 and 2.22.2, as well as in GeoTools, which GeoServer relies on for its core functionalities. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when used with relational database-based stores like PostGIS or Oracle DataStores and can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or service disruption. The root cause lies in the improper handling of specific OGC query functions and filters, such as PropertyIsLike, strEndsWith, strStartsWith, FeatureId, jsonArrayContains, and DWithin, especially when prepared statements are disabled. Mitigation involves upgrading to patched versions or disabling certain settings that facilitate the SQL injection.",
