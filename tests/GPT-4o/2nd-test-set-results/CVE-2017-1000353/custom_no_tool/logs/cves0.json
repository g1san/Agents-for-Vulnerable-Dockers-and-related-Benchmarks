      "description": "Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.\n\nIf Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered.\n\nSo, a cookie header such as:\n\n`DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` and a value of `b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d`\n\ninstead of 3 separate cookies.\n\n### Impact\nThis has security implications because if, say, `JSESSIONID` is an `HttpOnly` cookie, and the `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the `JSESSIONID` cookie into the `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server.\n\n### Patches\n* 9.4.51.v20230217 - via PR #9352\n* 10.0.15 - via PR #9339\n* 11.0.15 - via PR #9339\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds\n\n### References\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2965\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265\n",

The OP has also identified that during the call to `sessionDestroyed`, the `getLastAccessedTime()` throws an `IllegalStateException`, which potentially contrary to the servlet spec, so applications calling this method may always throw and fail to log out.  If such an application was only tested on a non clustered test environment, then it may be deployed on a clustered environment with multiple contexts and fail to log out.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe application should catch all Throwables within their `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` implementations.\n",

An attacker might exploit\n> this vulnerability in order to achieve SSRF or cause a denial of service.\n> One possible scenario is importing a (remote) malicious WAR into a Jetty’s server, while the\n> WAR includes a malicious web.xml.\n\n### Impact\nThere are no circumstances in a normally deployed Jetty server where potentially hostile XML is given to the XmlParser class without the attacker already having arbitrary access to the server. I.e. in order to exploit `XmlParser` the attacker would already have the ability to deploy and execute hostile code.  Specifically, Jetty has no protection against malicious web application and potentially hostile web applications should only be run on an isolated virtualisation.  \n\nThus this is not considered a vulnerability of the Jetty server itself, as any such usage of the jetty XmlParser is equally vulnerable as a direct usage of the JVM supplied SAX parser.  No CVE will be allocated to this advisory.\n\nHowever, any direct usage of the `XmlParser` class by an application may be vulnerable.  The impact would greatly depend on how the application uses `XmlParser`, but it could be a denial of service due to large entity expansion, or possibly the revealing local files if the XML results are accessible remotely.\n\n### Patches\nAbility to configure the SAXParserFactory to fit the needs of your particular XML parser implementation have been merged as part of PR #10067\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use `XmlParser` to parse data from users.\n\n\n",

This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

Pre-1.73 the implementation did not check the X.500 name of any certificate, subject, or issuer being passed in for LDAP wild cards, meaning the presence of a wild car may lead to Information Disclosure.\n\nA potential attack would be to generate a self-signed certificate with a subject name that contains special characters, e.g: `CN=Subject*)(objectclass=`. This will be included into the filter and provides the attacker ability to specify additional attributes in the search query. This can be exploited as a blind LDAP injection: an attacker can enumerate valid attribute values using the boolean blind injection technique. The exploitation depends on the structure of the target LDAP directory, as well as what kind of errors are exposed to the user.\n\nChanges to the `X509LDAPCertStoreSpi.java` class add the additional checking of any X.500 name used to correctly escape wild card characters.",

Within the same network, spoofed UDP packets could also be sent to make two Jenkins controllers go into an infinite loop of replies to one another, thus causing a denial of service.\n\nJenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now disables both UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast by default.\n\nAdministrators that need these features can re-enable them again by setting the system property `hudson.DNSMultiCast.disabled` to `false` (for DNS multicast) or the system property `hudson.udp` to `33848`, or another port (for UDP broadcast/multicast).

      "description": "jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible.\n\n### Impact\nSites that accept input HTML from users and use jsoup to sanitize that HTML, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if they have enabled `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` and do not set an appropriate Content Security Policy.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3.\n\nUsers should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo remediate this issue without immediately upgrading:\n\n- disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs\n- ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)\n\n### Background and root cause\njsoup includes a [Cleaner](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.html) component, which is designed to [sanitize input HTML](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) against configurable safe-lists of acceptable tags, attributes, and attribute values.\n\nThis includes removing potentially malicious attributes such as `<a href=\"javascript:...\">`, which may enable XSS attacks. It does this by validating URL attributes against allowed URL protocols (e.g. `http`, `https`).\n\nHowever, an attacker may be able to bypass this check by embedding control characters into the href attribute value. This causes the Java URL class, which is used to resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs before checking the URL's protocol, to treat the URL as a relative URL. It is then resolved into an absolute URL with the configured base URI.\n\nFor example, `java\\tscript:...` would resolve to `https://example.com/java\\tscript:...`.\n\nBy default, when using a safe-list that allows `a` tags, jsoup will rewrite any relative URLs (e.g. `/foo/`) to an absolute URL (e.g. `https://example.com/foo/`). Therefore, this attack attempt would be successfully mitigated. However, if the option [SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Safelist.html#preserveRelativeLinks(boolean)) is enabled (which does not rewrite relative links to absolute), the input is left as-is.\n\nWhile Java will treat a path like `java\\tscript:` as a relative path, as it does not match the allowed characters of a URL spec, browsers may normalize out the control characters, and subsequently evaluate it as a `javascript:` spec inline expression. That disparity then leads to an XSS opportunity.\n\nSites defining a Content Security Policy that does not allow javascript expressions in link URLs will not be impacted, as the policy will prevent the script's execution.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup)\n* Email the author of jsoup at [jonathan@hedley.net](mailto:jonathan@hedley.net)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Jens Häderer, who reported this issue, and contributed to its resolution.",

      "description": "## Summary\n\nEclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.\n\n## Details\n\n### Affected components\n\nThe vulnerable component is the `HttpURI` class when used as a utility class in an application.  The Jetty usage of the class is not vulnerable.\n\n### Attack overview\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does not well validate the authority section of a URI. When presented with an illegal authority that may contain user info (eg username:password#@hostname:port), then the parsing of the URI is not failed.  Moreover, the interpretation of what part of the authority is the host name differs from a common browser in  that they also do not fail, but they select a different host name from the illegal URI.\n\n### Attack scenario\n\nA typical attack scenario is illustrated in the diagram below. The Validator checks whether the attacker-supplied URL is on the blocklist. If not, the URI is passed to the Requester for redirection. The Requester is responsible for sending requests to the hostname specified by the URI.\n\nThis attack occurs when the Validator is the `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI` class and the Requester is the `Browser` (include chrome, firefox and Safari). An attacker can send a malformed URI to the Validator (e.g., `http://browser.check%23%40vulndetector.com/` ). After validation, the Validator finds that the hostname is not on the blocklist. However, the Requester can still send requests to the domain with the hostname `vulndetector.com`.\n\n## PoC\n\npayloads:\n\n```\nhttp://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://vulndetector.com\\\\/\n```\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTML tag scenarios. Below is a poc example. After clicking the button, the browser will open \"browser.check\", and jetty will parse this URL as \"vulndetector.com\".\n\n```\n<a href=\"http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\"></a>\n```\nA comparison of the parsing differences between Jetty and chrome is shown in the table below (note that neither should accept the URI as valid).\n\n| Invalid URI                                       | Jetty            | Chrome        |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTTP 302 Location\n\n| Input                    | Jetty          | Chrome        |\n| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check%5c/ | browser.check\\ | browser.check |\n\nIt is noteworthy that Spring Web also faced similar security vulnerabilities, being affected by the aforementioned four types of payloads. These issues have since been resolved and have been assigned three CVE numbers [3-5].\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is limited to developers that use the Jetty HttpURI directly.  Example: your project implemented a blocklist to block on some hosts based on HttpURI's handling of authority section.  The vulnerability will help attackers bypass the protections that developers have set up for hosts. The vulnerability will lead to **SSRF**[1] and **URL Redirection**[2] vulnerabilities in several cases. \n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe attacks outlined above rely on decoded user data being passed to the `HttpURI` class. Application should not pass decoded user data as an encoded URI to any URI class/method, including `HttpURI`.  Such applications are likely to be vulnerable in other ways. \nThe immediate solution is to upgrade to a version of the class that will fully validate the characters of the URI authority.  Ultimately, Jetty will deprecate and remove support for user info in the authority per [RFC9110 Section 4.2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-4.2.4). \n\nNote that the Chrome (and other browsers) parse the invalid user info section improperly as well (due to flawed WhatWG URL parsing rules that do not apply outside of a Web Browser).\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html\n[2] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html",

A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory.  If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files.  If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.\n\nAdditionally, any user code uses of [WebAppContext::getTempDirectory](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.31.v20200723/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#getTempDirectory()) would similarly be vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally, any user application code using the `ServletContext` attribute for the tempdir will also be impacted.\nSee: https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#TEMPDIR\n\nFor example:\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContext;\nimport javax.servlet.ServletException;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\n\npublic class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {\n    @Override\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {\n        File tempDir = (File)getServletContext().getAttribute(ServletContext.TEMPDIR); // Potentially compromised\n        // do something with that temp dir\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample: The JSP library itself will use the container temp directory for compiling the JSP source into Java classes before executing them.\n\n### CVSSv3.1 Evaluation\n\nThis vulnerability has been calculated to have a [CVSSv3.1 score of 7.8/10 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)\n\n### Patches\nFixes were applied to the 9.4.x branch with:\n- https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/53e0e0e9b25a6309bf24ee3b10984f4145701edb\n- https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/9ad6beb80543b392c91653f6bfce233fc75b9d5f\n\nThese will be included in releases: 9.4.33, 10.0.0.beta3, 11.0.0.beta3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA work around is to set a temporary directory, either for the server or the context, to a directory outside of the shared temporary file system.\nFor recent releases, a temporary directory can be created simple by creating a directory called `work` in the ${jetty.base} directory (the parent directory of the `webapps` directory).\nAlternately the java temporary directory can be set with the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`.    A more detailed description of how jetty selects a temporary directory is below.\n\nThe Jetty search order for finding a temporary directory is as follows:\n\n1. If the [`WebAppContext` has a temp directory specified](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/current/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#setTempDirectory(java.io.File)), use it.\n2. If the `ServletContext` has the `javax.servlet.context.tempdir` attribute set, and if directory exists, use it.\n3. If a `${jetty.base}/work` directory exists, use it (since Jetty 9.1)\n4. If a `ServletContext` has the `org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.basetempdir` attribute set, and if the directory exists, use it.\n5. Use `System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\")` and use it.\n\nJetty will end traversal at the first successful step.\nTo mitigate this vulnerability the directory must be set to one that is not writable by an attacker.  To avoid information leakage, the directory should also not be readable by an attacker.\n\n#### Setting a Jetty server temporary directory.\n\nChoices 3 and 5 apply to the server level, and will impact all deployed webapps on the server.\n\nFor choice 3  just create that work directory underneath your `${jetty.base}` and restart Jetty.\n\nFor choice 5, just specify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM for Jetty.\n\n``` shell\n[jetty-distribution]$ java -Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/web/work -jar start.jar\n```\n\n#### Setting a Context specific temporary directory.\n\nThe rest of the choices require you to configure the context for that deployed webapp (seen as `${jetty.base}/webapps/<context>.xml`)\n\nExample (excluding the DTD which is version specific):\n\n``` xml\n<Configure class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext\">\n  <Set name=\"contextPath\"><Property name=\"foo\"/></Set>\n  <Set name=\"war\">/var/web/webapps/foo.war</Set>\n  <Set name=\"tempDirectory\">/var/web/work/foo</Set>\n</Configure>\n```\n\n### References\n \n - https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/5451\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n - [CodeQL Query PR To Detect Similar Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/4473)\n\n### Similar Vulnerabilities\n\nSimilar, but not the same.\n\n - JUnit 4 - https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n - Google Guava - https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\n - Apache Ant - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1945\n - JetBrains Kotlin Compiler - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15824\n\n### For more information\n\nThe original report of this vulnerability is below:\n\n> On Thu, 15 Oct 2020 at 21:14, Jonathan Leitschuh <jonathan.leitschuh@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Hi WebTide Security Team,\n>\n> I'm a security researcher writing some custom CodeQL queries to find Local Temporary Directory Hijacking Vulnerabilities.

A malicious user (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or with wide ranges that overlap, or both, for a denial of service attack.

Such applications must also have a registration for serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an annotated controller that returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource.

If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\nUsers should upgrade to jsoup 1.14.2\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nUsers may rate limit input parsing. Users should limit the size of inputs based on system resources. Users should implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.\n",

      "description": "Jenkins 2.213 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier includes support for the Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 for communication between controller and agents. While [this protocol has been deprecated in 2018](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-old/#v2.128) and was recently removed from Jenkins in 2.214, it could still easily be enabled in Jenkins LTS 2.204.1, 2.213, and older.\n\nThis protocol incorrectly reuses encryption parameters which allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine the connection secret. This secret can then be used to connect attacker-controlled Jenkins agents to the Jenkins controller.\n\nJenkins 2.204.2 no longer allows for the use of Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 by default. The system property `jenkins.slaves.JnlpSlaveAgentProtocol3.ALLOW_UNSAFE` can be set to `true` to allow enabling the Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 in Jenkins 2.204.2, but doing so is strongly discouraged.\n\nInbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 was removed completely from Jenkins 2.214 and will not be part of Jenkins LTS after the end of the 2.204.x line.",

It will prevent all agent-to-controller file access using FilePath APIs. Because it is more restrictive than Jenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3, more plugins are incompatible with it. Make sure to read the plugin documentation before installing it.\n\nIt is not easily possible to [customize the file access rules](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/agent-to-controller/#file-access-rules) to prohibit access to the `libs/` directory specifically, as built-in rules (granting access to `<BUILDDIR>` contents) would take precedence over a custom rule prohibiting access.",

      "description": "Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons.\n\n\n\nA special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

      "description": "The agent-to-controller security subsystem limits which files on the Jenkins controller can be accessed by agent processes.\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities in the file path filtering implementation of Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier allow agent processes to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system, and obtain some information about Jenkins controller file systems.\n\nSECURITY-2542 / CVE-2021-21695: `FilePath#listFiles` lists files outside directories with agent read access when following symbolic links.\n\nWe expect that most of these vulnerabilities have been present since [SECURITY-144 was addressed in the 2014-10-30 security advisory](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2014-10-30/).\n\nJenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3 addresses these security vulnerabilities.\n\nSECURITY-2542 / CVE-2021-21695: `FilePath#listFiles` checks `stat` permission on files it returns, preventing listing files outside allowed directories.\n\nAs some common operations are now newly subject to access control, it is expected that plugins sending commands from agents to the controller may start failing. Additionally, the newly introduced path canonicalization means that instances using a custom builds directory ([Java system property jenkins.model.Jenkins.buildsDir](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#jenkins-model-jenkins-buildsdir)) or partitioning `JENKINS_HOME` using symbolic links may fail access control checks. See [the documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/agent-to-controller/#file-access-rules) for how to customize the configuration in case of problems.\n\nIf you are unable to immediately upgrade to Jenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3, you can install the [Remoting Security Workaround Plugin](https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/remoting-security-workaround/). It will prevent all agent-to-controller file access using `FilePath` APIs. Because it is more restrictive than Jenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3, more plugins are incompatible with it.

Note that earlier stable branches (1.0.x .. 2.18.x) have been EOLd already and do not receive updates anymore.\n\nIn general, RMI support can expose vulnerabilities by the mere presence of an exploitable class on the classpath. Even if Jackrabbit itself does not contain any code known to be exploitable anymore, adding other components to your server can expose the same type of problem. We therefore recommend to disable RMI access altogether (see further below), and will discuss deprecating RMI support in future Jackrabbit releases.\n\nHow to check whether RMI support is enabledRMI support can be over an RMI-specific TCP port, and over an HTTP binding. Both are by default enabled in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone.\n\nThe native RMI protocol by default uses port 1099. To check whether it is enabled, tools like \"netstat\" can be used to check.\n\nRMI-over-HTTP in Jackrabbit by default uses the path \"/rmi\". So when running standalone on port 8080, check whether an HTTP GET request on localhost:8080/rmi returns 404 (not enabled) or 200 (enabled). Note that the HTTP path may be different when the webapp is deployed in a container as non-root context, in which case the prefix is under the user's control.\n\nTurning off RMIFind web.xml (either in JAR/WAR file or in unpacked web application folder), and remove the declaration and the mapping definition for the RemoteBindingServlet: <servlet> <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name> <servlet-class>org.apache.jackrabbit.servlet.remote.RemoteBindingServlet</servlet-class> </servlet>\n<servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/rmi</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping>\nFind the bootstrap.properties file (in $REPOSITORY_HOME), and set rmi.enabled=false and also remove  rmi.host  rmi.port rmi.url-pattern\nIf there is no file named bootstrap.properties in $REPOSITORY_HOME, it is located  somewhere in the classpath. In this case, place a copy in $REPOSITORY_HOME  and modify it as explained.",

      "description": "Jenkins Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute. Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.\n\nIn Script Security Plugin 1.75 and 1.66.5, any calls from outside a sandboxed script to code defined inside a sandboxed script were always allowed. As sandboxed scripts can communicate their results through script return values and similar mechanisms, this could result in code defined inside of a sandboxed script to be called without sandbox protection.\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.\n\nScript Security Plugin 1.75 and 1.66.5 will prevent code defined inside a sandbox from being invoked outside a sandboxed script.\n\nIn rare cases, invocations of sandboxed scripts may begin failing if the script return value or script binding include code defined in the sandbox and is further processed by the calling code. To resolve this issue, the affected values need to be converted inside the sandboxed script to a known safe type, such as `String`.\n\nFor compatibility with this change, the following plugins should be upgraded to the versions specified:\n- [Email Extension Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/email-ext) should be updated to version 2.77 or newer.\n- [Warnings Next Generation Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng) should be updated to version 8.4.3 or newer.\n- [Warnings Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings) should be updated to version 5.0.2 or newer.",
