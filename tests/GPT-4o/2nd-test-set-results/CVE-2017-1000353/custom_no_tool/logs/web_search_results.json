    "desc": "CVE-2017-1000353 is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability found in Jenkins, specifically within the remoting-based Jenkins CLI (Command Line Interface). This vulnerability arises from improper handling of serialized Java objects, allowing attackers to transfer a crafted serialized Java `SignedObject` to the Jenkins CLI. This object is deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing existing blacklist-based protection mechanisms. The vulnerability affects Jenkins main line releases up to 2.56 and LTS releases up to 2.46.1. To mitigate this issue, Jenkins deprecated the remoting-based CLI protocol in favor of a new HTTP-based protocol and added the `SignedObject` to the remoting blocklist. Users are advised to update to Jenkins versions 2.57 or 2.46.2 to resolve this vulnerability.",
