    "desc": "CVE-2021-32682 is a critical vulnerability in elFinder, a widely-used web-based file manager. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on servers using elFinder's PHP connector. The issue arises from improper access control mechanisms, improper handling of file paths, and insufficient validation of user-controlled input. These vulnerabilities include deleting arbitrary files, moving arbitrary files, uploading PHP files, argument injection, and race conditions. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized actions, potential data exposure, manipulation, and full server compromise. The vulnerability affects elFinder version 2.1.58 and earlier, and it has been addressed in version 2.1.59. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to the latest version to mitigate these risks.",
