{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-40822 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in GeoServer, specifically affecting the TestWfsPost servlet. This vulnerability allows attackers to make unauthorized requests to specific targets, such as configurations involving PHP and Nginx. It enables an attacker to send arbitrary requests to perform lookups on an internal network that is not otherwise accessible externally. The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources or exposure of sensitive information. GeoServer versions through 2.18.5 and 2.19.x through 2.19.2 are vulnerable. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to upgrade to GeoServer versions 2.25.2 or 2.24.4, where the vulnerability has been fixed by removing the TestWfsPost servlet and replacing it with a JavaScript-based demo page.",
