    "desc": "CVE-2018-7602 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting multiple subsystems in Drupal versions 7.x and 8.x. The flaw arises due to insufficient input validation, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems without requiring authentication. This vulnerability is associated with the Drupal core and is classified as highly critical, identified as SA-CORE-2018-002. It has been actively exploited in the wild, emphasizing the need for immediate security updates. Exploitation involves injecting a renderable array into an input field using malformed GET or POST requests, potentially leading to complete site compromise. Administrators are advised to update to Drupal versions 7.59, 8.4.8, or 8.5.3 to mitigate this vulnerability.",
