    "desc": "CVE-2021-28169 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server, specifically affecting the ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter components. This vulnerability exists in Jetty versions 9.4.40 and earlier, 10.0.2 and earlier, and 11.0.2 and earlier. The issue arises from a double decoding problem that allows unauthorized access to protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. By sending a specially crafted request with a doubly encoded path, such as `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml`, an attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration files like `web.xml`. This vulnerability exposes sensitive implementation details of a web application, which can be used for further attacks. The vulnerability is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.3. It does not require authentication or user interaction, impacting confidentiality without affecting integrity or availability. The recommended mitigation is to update Jetty to versions 9.4.41, 10.0.3, or 11.0.3, which address this vulnerability.",
