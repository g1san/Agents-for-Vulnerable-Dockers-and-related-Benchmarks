    "desc": "CVE-2019-20933 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability found in InfluxDB versions prior to 1.7.6. This vulnerability arises from an issue in the authenticate function within the file services/httpd/handler.go, where a JSON Web Token (JWT) can have an empty SharedSecret. This flaw allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database. The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, highlighting its severity. Exploiting this vulnerability involves checking if the server is susceptible and then attempting to obtain a remote query shell, which can be used to execute database queries such as \"SHOW DATABASES\". The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating InfluxDB to version 1.7.6 or later.",
