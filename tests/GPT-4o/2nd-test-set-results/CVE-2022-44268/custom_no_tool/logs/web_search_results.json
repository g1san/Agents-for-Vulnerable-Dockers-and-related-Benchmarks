    "desc": "CVE-2022-44268 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick version 7.1.0-49 that allows for arbitrary file reads. This vulnerability is particularly concerning because it can be exploited through the processing of specially crafted PNG image files. An attacker can embed a file path into a PNG image using tools like `pngcrush`, and when this image is processed by ImageMagick's `convert` tool, it can lead to unauthorized file reading. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation during the parsing of PNG images, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive files on a server where ImageMagick is used. This issue has a CVSS score of 6.5, indicating medium severity, with a network attack vector and low attack complexity, requiring no privileges but mandatory user interaction. The vulnerability impacts confidentiality but not integrity or availability.",
