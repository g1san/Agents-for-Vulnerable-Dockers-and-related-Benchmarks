    "desc": "CVE-2017-17562 is a vulnerability found in the GoAhead web server versions 2.5 to 3.6.5. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to improper handling of environment variables in CGI scripts. The cgiHandler function in GoAhead's code improperly trusts HTTP request parameters and passes them as environment variables to CGI scripts. This flaw can be exploited by injecting arbitrary environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD, which can lead to the execution of malicious code. Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests to manipulate these environment variables and execute arbitrary shared objects, potentially gaining control over the server. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous when CGI support is enabled and CGI programs are dynamically linked. The vulnerability is network-exploitable, does not require authentication, and has a high CVSS score of 9.1, indicating a significant risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
