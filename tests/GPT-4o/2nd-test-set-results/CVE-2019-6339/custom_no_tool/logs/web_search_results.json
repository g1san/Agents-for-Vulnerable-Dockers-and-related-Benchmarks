    "desc": "CVE-2019-6339 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Drupal content management framework. It affects Drupal core versions prior to 7.62, 8.6.6, and 8.5.9. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input when executing file operations with PHP's built-in phar stream wrapper. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specially designed request that bypasses security restrictions, allowing them to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected system. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited remotely without authentication, making it a significant threat to unpatched Drupal installations.",
