    "desc": "CVE-2018-16509 is a vulnerability in Artifex Ghostscript, a suite used for interpreting Adobe PostScript and PDF languages. The vulnerability exists in Ghostscript versions prior to 9.24 and arises from incorrect restoration of privilege checking during the handling of /invalidaccess exceptions. This flaw can be exploited by attackers who can supply crafted PostScript files to execute arbitrary shell commands using the \"pipe\" instruction. The vulnerability allows for remote shell command execution by bypassing the -dSAFER mode. This is achieved through a crafted PostScript file that exploits a failed restore (grestore) command to disable LockSafetyParams and avoid invalid access restrictions. The vulnerability is particularly exploitable when Ghostscript is used as a backend for image processing libraries like Python's PIL/Pillow or applications like ImageMagick. This vulnerability has a CVSS 3.0 severity score of 7.8, indicating high risk, and impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
