    "desc": "CVE-2021-42392 is a critical vulnerability in the H2 database console, similar in nature to the Log4Shell vulnerability. It arises from improper handling of JNDI remote class loading, which can allow unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) if exploited. The vulnerability specifically affects the H2 console, which by default only listens to localhost connections. However, if configured to accept remote connections, it becomes highly critical. The vulnerability can be exploited through the H2 console or other vectors, such as the H2 shell tool and SQL-based vectors, though these require specific conditions or privileges. To mitigate the risk, users are advised to upgrade to H2 version 2.0.206, which restricts JNDI URLs to local protocols only, preventing remote LDAP/RMI queries.",
