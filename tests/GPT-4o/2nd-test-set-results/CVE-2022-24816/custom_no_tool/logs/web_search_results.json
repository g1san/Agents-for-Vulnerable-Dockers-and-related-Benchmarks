    "desc": "CVE-2022-24816 is a critical code injection vulnerability found in the jt-jiffle extension of the GeoServer project, specifically affecting the JAI-EXT library versions prior to 1.1.22. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting the way Jiffle scripts are processed. Jiffle scripts, which are provided through network requests, are converted into Java code and compiled into byte-code using the Janino compiler. The vulnerability arises because these scripts can be compiled and executed without proper validation or escaping, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 or 10.0, highlighting its severity. It can be exploited by sending specially crafted requests to the GeoServer's WMS endpoint, which does not require authentication. The patch for this vulnerability involves validating input variable names and escaping Javadocs in the Jiffle script output, or upgrading to JAI-EXT version 1.1.22 or later.",
