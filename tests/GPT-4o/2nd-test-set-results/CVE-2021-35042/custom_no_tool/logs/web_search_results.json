    "desc": "CVE-2021-35042 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Django, affecting versions 3.1.x before 3.1.13 and 3.2.x before 3.2.5. The vulnerability arises from unsanitized user input passed to the QuerySet.order_by method, which can lead to SQL injection. This occurs because the input can bypass column reference validation. Attackers can exploit this by appending raw SQL references to the order_by parameter in a URL, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands such as retrieving database directories or password hashes. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it can be exploited without any privileges or user interaction, and the attack can be carried out over a network with low complexity. The issue has been patched in Django versions 3.1.13 and 3.2.5, and upgrading to these versions or later is recommended to mitigate the risk.",
