{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-7600, also known as \"Drupalgeddon 2,\" is a critical vulnerability affecting Drupal versions 7.x before 7.58, 8.3.x before 8.3.9, 8.4.x before 8.4.6, and 8.5.x before 8.5.1. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation in the Drupal core, particularly in the Drupal 7 Form API. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to the server hosting the Drupal instance. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code without authentication. This can lead to complete control over the affected Drupal site and potentially the host machine. The attack exploits AJAX requests using Drupal Form API's renderable arrays, which render pages through Drupal\u2019s theming system. Public proof-of-concept exploits demonstrate how attackers can target form fields like the mail[] array and timezone field using functions like [#post_render] and [#lazy_builder]. This vulnerability is significant due to its widespread impact, ease of exploitation, and potential for severe consequences such as downloading malware or launching crypto-miners.",
