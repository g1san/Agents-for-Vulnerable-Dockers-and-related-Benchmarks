{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-5385, also known as \"httpoxy,\" is a vulnerability affecting CGI or CGI-like environments, particularly those using PHP through version 7.0.8. The vulnerability arises from a namespace conflict described in RFC 3875, where the HTTP Proxy header from a request is mapped to the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. This variable is commonly used to configure outgoing proxies, and the conflict can be exploited by remote attackers. By crafting a malicious Proxy header in an HTTP request, attackers can redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server. This vulnerability is particularly problematic for applications using the getenv('HTTP_PROXY') call or configured with CGI, leading to potential data confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.1, indicating high severity. The vulnerability has been patched in PHP version 5.6.24 and later, as well as in version 7.0.9 and later.",
