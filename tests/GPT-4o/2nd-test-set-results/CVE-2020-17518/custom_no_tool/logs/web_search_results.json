{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-17518 is a vulnerability in the Apache Flink RESTful API, specifically through a REST handler introduced in version 1.5.1. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file uploads via directory traversal, enabling attackers to upload files to arbitrary directories on the local filesystem through crafted HTTP requests. The issue affects all versions before 1.11.3, but it has been fixed in version 1.11.3 and later. The vulnerable code is located in the `FileUploadHandler.java` class, where user input for the filename parameter was not properly sanitized. The exploit involves sending a POST request to the `/jars/upload` endpoint with a manipulated filename to achieve directory traversal. This can lead to overwriting existing files and potentially achieving remote code execution. The vulnerability affects Apache Flink versions 1.5.1 to 1.11.2 and has been patched in version 1.11.3 and above. Users are advised to upgrade to these versions to secure their systems.",
