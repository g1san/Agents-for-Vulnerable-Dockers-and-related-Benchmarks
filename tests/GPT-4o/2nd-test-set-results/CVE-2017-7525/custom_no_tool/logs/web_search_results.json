{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-7525 is a critical security vulnerability found in the Jackson Databind library, a popular Java library used for processing JSON data. This vulnerability is related to the deserialization of untrusted data using the library's default typing feature. The flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely by sending specially crafted JSON input to the application using vulnerable versions of Jackson Databind. The deserialization process, particularly the `createBeanDeserializer[]` function in the `BeanDeserializerFactory` class, permits the execution of untrusted Java objects. This issue affects versions of Jackson Databind before 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1, and 2.8.9. It is crucial for developers using Jackson Databind to upgrade to version 2.10.0 or later, which provides enhanced security features to mitigate this risk. The vulnerability has a high severity rating, with CVSS scores of 7.5 (CVSS 2.0) and 8.5 (Sonatype CVSS 3), highlighting its potential impact on applications processing JSON from untrusted sources.",
