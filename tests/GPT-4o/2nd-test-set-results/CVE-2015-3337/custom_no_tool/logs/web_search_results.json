{
    "desc": "CVE-2015-3337 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch that allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the server. This vulnerability affects Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.4.5 and 1.5.2 when a 'site plugin' is installed. The issue arises from insufficient path normalization, which allows unauthorized file access through crafted URL paths. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the Elasticsearch server, targeting the endpoint `/_plugin/head/` followed by a directory traversal sequence (`../../../../../../../../../`) to access sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`. The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to Elasticsearch 1.4.5 or 1.5.2, disabling site plugins, or blocking HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This vulnerability highlights the importance of securing plugin installations to prevent unauthorized file access.",
