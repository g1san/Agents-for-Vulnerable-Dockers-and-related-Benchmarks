    "desc": "CVE-2021-26120 is a critical vulnerability affecting versions of the Smarty template engine for PHP below 3.1.39. This vulnerability allows attackers to perform arbitrary code injection via the misuse of template function names. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from improper handling and filtering of function names in templates by the `Smarty_Internal_Runtime_TplFunction` class. This flaw enables attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code within the context of the application using Smarty. The exploitation does not require user interaction or elevated privileges, making it highly dangerous as it can lead to a complete compromise of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access sensitive information, modify files, or deny access to resources. It is crucial for users to upgrade to Smarty version 3.1.39 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability.",
