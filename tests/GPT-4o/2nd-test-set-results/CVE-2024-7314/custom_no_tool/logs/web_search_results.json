    "desc": "CVE-2024-7314 is a critical vulnerability in the anji-plus AJ-Report software, which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication by appending \";swagger-ui\" to HTTP requests. This bypass enables the attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the victim server, leading to potential impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-280 and CWE-288 for improper handling of permissions and authentication bypass using an alternate path. It has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating high severity. Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any privileges or user interaction. The vulnerability affects versions of AJ-Report before 1.4.1, and a patch is available to mitigate the issue.",
