    "desc": "CVE-2023-51449 is a path traversal vulnerability in the Gradio framework, affecting versions 4.0 to 4.10. This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files from a server hosting Gradio by exploiting a flawed file endpoint check. Attackers can access sensitive information such as environment variables, API keys, and tokens. The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.0 and is a regression of a prior vulnerability, CVE-2023-34239. Although Gradio patched the issue in version 4.11, some applications on the Hugging Face Spaces platform remained vulnerable due to outdated Gradio versions. The vulnerability can also be exploited for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing access to arbitrary files on a machine hosting a Gradio app with a public URL, provided the attacker knows the file paths. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6 and is categorized under CWE-22, which pertains to path traversal. It can be exploited over a network with low complexity, without requiring any privileges or user interaction. The main impact is on confidentiality, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
