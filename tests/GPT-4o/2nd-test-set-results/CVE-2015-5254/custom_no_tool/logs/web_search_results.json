    "desc": "CVE-2015-5254 is a critical vulnerability found in Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.8.0 to 5.12.1. This vulnerability arises from improper input validation where the broker does not restrict the classes that can be serialized. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted serialized Java Message Service (JMS) ObjectMessage object. The vulnerability is exploited by sending serialized Java objects to the ActiveMQ service, which listens on the default port 61616. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server by crafting a malicious payload and sending it to the service. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its high severity. It affects various versions and has been addressed in versions 5.11.3 and 5.12.2.",
