    "desc": "CVE-2018-1000533 is a vulnerability found in GitList, a PHP-based graphical tool for viewing Git repositories, specifically in version 0.6.0 and earlier. The vulnerability arises due to a command parameter injection issue in the `searchTree` function where improperly sanitized input is passed to the system function. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely with the privileges of the PHP user. Exploitation of this vulnerability involves accessing the vulnerable environment, identifying an exploitable point, capturing and modifying data packets using tools like Burp Suite, and injecting a web shell into the website directory. This can lead to unauthorized access, retrieval of sensitive data, and potential control over the system. The issue was addressed in GitList version 0.7.",
