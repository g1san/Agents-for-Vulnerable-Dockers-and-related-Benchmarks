    "desc": "CVE-2024-27348 is a critical security vulnerability identified in Apache HugeGraph-Server, a graph database system. This vulnerability specifically affects versions from 1.0.0 up to, but not including, 1.3.0, when running on Java 8 and Java 11. The issue arises from insufficient input validation in the server's command execution functionality, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the server. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected system, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate data, disrupt services, or further compromise the network.",
