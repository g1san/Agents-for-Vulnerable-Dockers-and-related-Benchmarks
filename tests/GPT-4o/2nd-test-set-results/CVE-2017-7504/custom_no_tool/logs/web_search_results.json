    "desc": "CVE-2017-7504 is a critical vulnerability found in the HTTPServerILServlet.java component of the JMS over HTTP Invocation Layer in the JBossMQ implementation. This vulnerability affects Red Hat JBoss Application Server versions up to and including JBoss 4.X. The issue arises because the server does not restrict the classes for which it performs deserialization, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending crafted serialized data. This vulnerability is classified under CWE-502 and has a CVSS score indicating high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require authentication and can be executed without user interaction, making it particularly dangerous. An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending specially-crafted serialized data to the server, leading to remote code execution.",
