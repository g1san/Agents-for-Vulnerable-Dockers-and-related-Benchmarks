{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-3714, also known as \"ImageTragick,\" is a critical security vulnerability in ImageMagick, a popular open-source software suite used for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and vector image files. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of shell metacharacters in crafted image files. Specifically, the EPHEMERAL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN, and PLT coders are affected in versions before 6.9.3-10 and 7.x before 7.0.1-1. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by embedding malicious shell commands within image files. When these crafted images are processed by ImageMagick, the embedded commands can be executed with the privileges of the ImageMagick process, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
