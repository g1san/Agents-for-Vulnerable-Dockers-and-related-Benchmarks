    "desc": "CVE-2017-12149 is a critical vulnerability in the JBoss Application Server, specifically within the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) subsystem. It involves insecure deserialization in the doFilter() method of the ReadOnlyAccessFilter in the HTTP Invoker, which fails to restrict classes during deserialization. This flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary EJB methods due to improper security constraints, leading to remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability affects Red Hat's JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 5.x, particularly version 5.2, and JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.0. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the affected server, bypassing authentication and authorization controls, potentially compromising the server's security and integrity. The vulnerability can be mitigated by modifying the web.xml file in the http-invoker.sar deployment to restrict access to authorized users only.",
