    "desc": "CVE-2020-29599 is a vulnerability found in ImageMagick, a popular software suite used for editing and converting image files. This flaw exists in versions before 6.9.11-40 and 7.x before 7.0.10-40. The vulnerability is related to the mishandling of the -authenticate option, which is intended for setting passwords on password-protected PDF files. The issue arises because the input for passwords was not properly escaped or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject additional shell commands through the coders/pdf.c file. This improper handling of user-controlled input can lead to unauthorized command execution.",
