{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-45232 is a critical unauthorized access vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard that can lead to remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability arises due to improper access control mechanisms, where some APIs bypass the authentication middleware by directly using the gin framework instead of the droplet framework. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on the server, posing a significant security risk. The affected versions are Apache APISIX Dashboard 2.7 to 2.10, and users are advised to upgrade to version 2.10.1 or later to mitigate this issue.",
