    "desc": "CVE-2018-1297 is a critical vulnerability in Apache JMeter, a widely used open-source tool for performance testing. This vulnerability is present in JMeter versions 2.x and 3.x, specifically when using the Distributed Test functionality, which relies on an unsecured Remote Method Invocation (RMI) connection. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting JMeter by sending specially crafted requests to the JMeter server. This can lead to unauthorized access to the JMeterEngine, manipulation of test results, or disruption of testing processes. The critical nature of this vulnerability is underscored by its high CVSS score of 9.8, reflecting the potential for remote code execution without the need for user interaction or specific privileges. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to update to a patched version of JMeter or disable Distributed Testing, and ensure JMeter instances are isolated on secure networks.",
