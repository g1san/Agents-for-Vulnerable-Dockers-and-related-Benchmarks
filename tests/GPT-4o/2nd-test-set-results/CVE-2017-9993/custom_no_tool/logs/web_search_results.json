    "desc": "CVE-2017-9993 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg, a widely used multimedia framework, that affects versions before 2.8.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.9, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, 3.2.x before 3.2.6, and 3.3.x before 3.3.2. The issue arises from improper restrictions on HTTP Live Streaming filename extensions and demuxer names, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files through crafted playlist data. This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200, indicating exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors. Exploitation of this vulnerability can be achieved through Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to read arbitrary data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. It was published on June 28, 2017, and is significant enough to require users to update to patched versions to mitigate potential security risks.",
