    "desc": "CVE-2021-21311 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in Adminer, an open-source database management tool packaged as a single PHP file. This vulnerability affects Adminer versions from 4.0.0 to before 4.7.9, specifically impacting users who utilize versions bundling all drivers, such as adminer.php. The issue allows attackers to exploit Adminer to interact with internal services and potentially steal data. By leveraging this SSRF vulnerability, attackers can access internal services, retrieve sensitive information, and potentially cause further exploitation. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2, indicating a high severity level, and was patched in version 4.7.9.",
