    "desc": "CVE-2016-1897 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg software, specifically within the libavfilter component. This flaw is associated with the `avfilter_filter_samples()` function and involves improper handling of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) m3u8 files. The vulnerability can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and arbitrary file read issues. It allows remote attackers to exploit the concat protocol within an m3u8 file to perform unauthorized HTTP requests and access file contents. This can result in arbitrary code execution if a crafted media file is processed by FFmpeg. The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions 2.x and was addressed in version 2.8.5 and later.",
