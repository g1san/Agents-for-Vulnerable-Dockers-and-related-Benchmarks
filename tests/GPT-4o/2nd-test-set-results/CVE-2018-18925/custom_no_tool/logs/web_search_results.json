    "desc": "CVE-2018-18925 is a critical vulnerability in Gogs, a self-hosted Git service. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to a directory traversal flaw in the session management system, which relies on the Macaron framework. The flaw arises from improper validation of session identifiers, which are stored as files on the file system. Attackers can manipulate the session identifier by setting the `i_like_gogits` cookie to a path like `../../../../../../etc/passwd`, thereby gaining unauthorized access to arbitrary files. By uploading a specially crafted file and using it as a session ID, attackers can log in as administrators. Once authenticated, they can exploit the git hooks functionality to execute arbitrary shell scripts by injecting code into a pre-receive hook and triggering it with a push request. This vulnerability affects Gogs versions 0.11.66 and earlier, and it allows attackers to bypass authentication, gain administrator privileges, and execute any command on the server, leading to full system compromise.",
