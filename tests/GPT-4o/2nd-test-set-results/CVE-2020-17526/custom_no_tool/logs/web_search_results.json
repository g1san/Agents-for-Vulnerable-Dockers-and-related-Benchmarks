{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-17526 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache Airflow's web interface, which arises from a security misconfiguration where a default static key, \"temporary_key,\" is used to sign authentication cookies. This vulnerability allows attackers to forge session cookies and escalate privileges by modifying the user_id attribute to impersonate an admin. Exploiting this vulnerability could enable attackers to execute code on the server, potentially compromising cloud credentials and accessing the entire cloud account. This vulnerability affects Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.14. The issue was fixed in Airflow versions 1.10.15 and 2.0.2 by replacing the static key with a randomly generated one.",
