    "desc": "CVE-2021-43008 is an arbitrary file read vulnerability affecting Adminer versions 1.0 up to 4.6.2. This vulnerability arises from improper access control, allowing attackers to read files from the server where Adminer is installed. By exploiting this flaw, attackers can connect a remote MySQL database to Adminer and use the \"SQL Command\" page to execute commands that read local files on the server and load them into their remote database. This vulnerability has been exploited by malicious actors to inject payment skimmers and has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5, indicating high severity. The issue is resolved in Adminer version 4.6.3.",
