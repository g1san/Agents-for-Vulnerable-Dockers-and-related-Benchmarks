    "desc": "CVE-2019-14234 is a SQL injection vulnerability found in Django, specifically affecting the JSONField and HStoreField model fields. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate the field name of a queryset, potentially leading to unauthorized SQL command execution. The issue arises from the way JSONField handles SQL query generation, particularly through the `KeyTransformFactory` class, which concatenates JSON field names as strings in SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection. This can be exploited if an attacker can control the names of the keys in a JSONField filter query, which is feasible in scenarios where user input is directly passed to Django's queryset filter method or in Django-Admin, where users can control queryset query key names. The affected versions of Django are 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized SQL command execution, potentially compromising the database. It was addressed in a security update released on August 1, 2019.",
