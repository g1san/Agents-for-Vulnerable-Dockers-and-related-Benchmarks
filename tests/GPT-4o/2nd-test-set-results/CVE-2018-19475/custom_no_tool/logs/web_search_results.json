{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-19475 is a vulnerability in Ghostscript, an interpreter for the PostScript language, which allows for arbitrary shell command execution even when operating in the SAFER mode. The vulnerability stems from a sandbox bypass that exploits improper handling of the LockSafetyParams during a restore operation. By triggering an error after the z2restore function but before .setuserparams, an attacker can leave the device in a state where LockSafetyParams is set to false, enabling the execution of shell commands via the %pipe% syntax. This vulnerability affects versions of Ghostscript before 9.26 and was discovered using CodeQL for variant analysis. It allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions due to unchecked available stack space when the device remains unchanged. The vulnerability impacts systems that use Ghostscript for image processing, especially in environments where user-uploaded files are processed without proper validation or sandboxing. It has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, indicating a high risk.",
