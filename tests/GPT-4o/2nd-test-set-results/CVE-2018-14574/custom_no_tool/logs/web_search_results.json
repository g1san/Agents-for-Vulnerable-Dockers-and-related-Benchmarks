{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-14574 is an open redirect vulnerability in Django's CommonMiddleware. This vulnerability occurs when the APPEND_SLASH setting is enabled (APPEND_SLASH=True), which is the default setting. If a URL does not end with a slash and is not found in the urlpatterns, the middleware appends a slash and checks for the new URL in urlpatterns. If found, it redirects to the new URL. This behavior can be exploited by constructing URLs that lead to unintended redirections. The issue arises because the middleware does not properly handle URLs starting with double slashes, which can be interpreted by browsers as absolute paths leading to external sites. This vulnerability affects Django versions 1.11.x before 1.11.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.8. It can be exploited to redirect users to malicious sites, which can be used for phishing attacks or other malicious activities. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-601, related to open redirection in URLs.",
