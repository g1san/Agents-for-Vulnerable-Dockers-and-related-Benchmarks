    "desc": "CVE-2016-3088 is a critical security vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, a widely used Java-based message broker. This vulnerability affects Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.x prior to 5.14.0 and is specifically found in the Fileserver web application component. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the lack of restrictions in the file upload and management process. Attackers can use an HTTP PUT request to upload malicious files and then use an HTTP MOVE request to relocate these files to directories with execute permissions. This can be exploited to deploy and execute a webshell or other malicious scripts, gaining control over the server without needing authentication. The vulnerability is particularly severe due to its remote exploitability and the potential for complete server compromise, earning it a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8. Mitigation involves upgrading to ActiveMQ version 5.14.0 or later, where the vulnerable FileServer feature has been removed, or disabling the FileServer feature in the configuration file 'jetty.xml'.",
