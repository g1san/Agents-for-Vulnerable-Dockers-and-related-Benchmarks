However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.  The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.  The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.  The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.  While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.

      "description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.",

      "description": "Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.  Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low.  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding.  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.  Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution cannot easily be ruled out.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",

      "description": "Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.\n\nIf Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered.\n\nSo, a cookie header such as:\n\n`DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` and a value of `b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d`\n\ninstead of 3 separate cookies.\n\n### Impact\nThis has security implications because if, say, `JSESSIONID` is an `HttpOnly` cookie, and the `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the `JSESSIONID` cookie into the `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server.\n\n### Patches\n* 9.4.51.v20230217 - via PR #9352\n* 10.0.15 - via PR #9339\n* 11.0.15 - via PR #9339\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds\n\n### References\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2965\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265\n",

On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated.  This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in.\n\nThere is no known path for an attacker to induce such an exception to be thrown, thus they must rely on an application to throw such an exception.    The OP has also identified that during the call to `sessionDestroyed`, the `getLastAccessedTime()` throws an `IllegalStateException`, which potentially contrary to the servlet spec, so applications calling this method may always throw and fail to log out.  If such an application was only tested on a non clustered test environment, then it may be deployed on a clustered environment with multiple contexts and fail to log out.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe application should catch all Throwables within their `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` implementations.\n",

      "description": "If a user sends a request to a `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet for a binary with a space in its name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. For example, if a request references a binary called file” name “here, the escaping algorithm will generate the command line string “file” name “here”, which will invoke the binary named file, not the one that the user requested.\n\n```java\nif (execCmd.length() > 0 && execCmd.charAt(0) != '\"' && execCmd.contains(\" \"))\nexecCmd = \"\\\"\" + execCmd + \"\\\"\";\n```\n\n### Exploit Scenario\nThe cgi-bin directory contains a binary named exec and a subdirectory named exec” commands, which contains a file called bin1. The user sends to the CGI servlet a request for the filename exec” commands/bin1. This request will pass the file existence check on lines 194 through 205. The servlet will add quotation marks around this filename, resulting in the command line string “exec” commands/bin1”. When this string is passed to Runtime.exec, instead of executing the bin1 binary, the server will execute the exec\nbinary with the argument commands/file1”. In addition to being incorrect, this behavior may bypass alias checks, and it may cause other unintended behaviors if a command prefix is configured.\n\nIf the useFullPath configuration setting is off, the command need not pass the existence check. The attack would not rely on a binary and subdirectory having similar names, and the attack will succeed on a much wider variety of directory structures.\n\n### Impact\nUsers of the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet with a very specific command structure may have the wrong command executed.\n\n### Patches\nNo patch.\nIn Jetty 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been deprecated.\nIn Jetty 12 (all environments) the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been entirely removed.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet should not be used. Fast CGI support is available instead.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9516\n* https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9889\n* https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9888",

An attacker might exploit\n> this vulnerability in order to achieve SSRF or cause a denial of service.\n> One possible scenario is importing a (remote) malicious WAR into a Jetty’s server, while the\n> WAR includes a malicious web.xml.\n\n### Impact\nThere are no circumstances in a normally deployed Jetty server where potentially hostile XML is given to the XmlParser class without the attacker already having arbitrary access to the server. I.e. in order to exploit `XmlParser` the attacker would already have the ability to deploy and execute hostile code.  Specifically, Jetty has no protection against malicious web application and potentially hostile web applications should only be run on an isolated virtualisation.  \n\nThus this is not considered a vulnerability of the Jetty server itself, as any such usage of the jetty XmlParser is equally vulnerable as a direct usage of the JVM supplied SAX parser.  No CVE will be allocated to this advisory.\n\nHowever, any direct usage of the `XmlParser` class by an application may be vulnerable.  The impact would greatly depend on how the application uses `XmlParser`, but it could be a denial of service due to large entity expansion, or possibly the revealing local files if the XML results are accessible remotely.\n\n### Patches\nAbility to configure the SAXParserFactory to fit the needs of your particular XML parser implementation have been merged as part of PR #10067\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use `XmlParser` to parse data from users.\n\n\n",

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.  However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.

IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks.

By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.",

      "description": "### Overview\n\nA flaw in Jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible **information disclosure** in systems using **pooled or reused buffers**, like Netty or Vert.x.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability affects the creation of exception messages like:\n\n```\nJsonParseException: Unexpected character ... at [Source: (byte[])...]\n```\n\nWhen `JsonFactory.createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len)` is used, and an error occurs while parsing, the exception message should include a snippet from the specified logical payload. However, the method `_appendSourceDesc` ignores the `offset`, and always starts reading from index `0`.\n\nIf the buffer contains residual sensitive data from a previous request, such as credentials or document contents, that data may be exposed if the exception is propagated to the client.\n\nThe issue particularly impacts server applications using:\n\n* Pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty)\n* Frameworks that surface parse errors in HTTP responses\n* Default Jackson settings (i.e., `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` is enabled)\n\nA documented real-world example is [CVE-2021-22145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145) in Elasticsearch, which stemmed from the same root cause.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker sends malformed JSON to a service using Jackson and pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty-based HTTP servers). If the server reuses a buffer and includes the parser’s exception in its HTTP 400 response, the attacker may receive residual data from previous requests.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1000];\nSystem.arraycopy(\"SECRET\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 0, 6);\nSystem.arraycopy(\"{ \\\"bad\\\": }\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 700, 10);\n\nJsonFactory factory = new JsonFactory();\nJsonParser parser = factory.createParser(buffer, 700, 20);\nparser.nextToken(); // throws exception\n\n// Exception message will include \"SECRET\"\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via [PR #652](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652).\n\nAll users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by:\n\n1. **Disabling exception message exposure to clients** — avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses.\n2. **Disabling source inclusion in exceptions** by setting:\n\n   ```java\n   jsonFactory.disable(JsonFactory.Feature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION);\n   ```\n\n    This prevents Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\n\n### References\n* [Pull Request #652 (Fix implementation)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652)\n* [CVE-2021-22145 (Elasticsearch exposure of this flaw)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145)",

For example a request to the `ConcatServlet` with a URI of `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.\n\nThis occurs because both `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` decode the supplied path to verify it is not within the `WEB-INF` or `META-INF` directories. It then uses this decoded path to call `RequestDispatcher` which will also do decoding of the path. This double decoding allows paths with a doubly encoded `WEB-INF` to bypass this security check.\n\n### Impact\nThis affects all versions of `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` in versions before 9.4.41, 10.0.3 and 11.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot update to the latest version of Jetty, you can instead deploy your own version of the [`ConcatServlet`](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/4204526d2fdad355e233f6bf18a44bfe028ee00b/jetty-servlets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/ConcatServlet.java) and/or the [`WelcomeFilter`](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/4204526d2fdad355e233f6bf18a44bfe028ee00b/jetty-servlets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/WelcomeFilter.java) by using the code from the latest version of Jetty.\n",

There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround as there is no known exploit scenario.   \n\n### Original Report \n\n[RFC 9110 Secion 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6) defined the value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits. However we found that Jetty accepts \"+\" prefixed Content-Length, which could lead to potential HTTP request smuggling.\n\nPayload:\n\n```\n POST / HTTP/1.1\n Host: a.com\n Content-Length: +16\n Connection: close\n ​\n 0123456789abcdef\n```\n\nWhen sending this payload to Jetty, it can successfully parse and identify the length.\n\nWhen sending this payload to NGINX, Apache HTTPd or other HTTP servers/parsers, they will return 400 bad request.\n\nThis behavior can lead to HTTP request smuggling and can be leveraged to bypass WAF or IDS.",

Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM.\n\niq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5, but in the long term users should prefer migrating to the Snappy implementation in https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor (version 0.27 or newer).\n\n### Impact\nWhen uncompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM.\n",

      "description": "Description\nThere exists a security vulnerability in Jetty's DosFilter which can be exploited by unauthorized users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the server using DosFilter. By repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the server's memory finally.\n\n\nVulnerability details\nThe Jetty DoSFilter (Denial of Service Filter) is a security filter designed to protect web applications against certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behavior. It helps to mitigate excessive resource consumption by limiting the rate at which clients can make requests to the server.  The DoSFilter monitors and tracks client request patterns, including request rates, and can take actions such as blocking or delaying requests from clients that exceed predefined thresholds.  The internal tracking of requests in DoSFilter is the source of this OutOfMemory condition.\n\n\nImpact\nUsers of the DoSFilter may be subject to DoS attacks that will ultimately exhaust the memory of the server if they have not configured session passivation or an aggressive session inactivation timeout.\n\n\nPatches\nThe DoSFilter has been patched in all active releases to no longer support the session tracking mode, even if configured.\n\n\nPatched releases:\n\n  *  9.4.54\n  *  10.0.18\n  *  11.0.18\n  *  12.0.3",

To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.  For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

      "description": "## Summary\n\nEclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.\n\n## Details\n\n### Affected components\n\nThe vulnerable component is the `HttpURI` class when used as a utility class in an application.  The Jetty usage of the class is not vulnerable.\n\n### Attack overview\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does not well validate the authority section of a URI. When presented with an illegal authority that may contain user info (eg username:password#@hostname:port), then the parsing of the URI is not failed.  Moreover, the interpretation of what part of the authority is the host name differs from a common browser in  that they also do not fail, but they select a different host name from the illegal URI.\n\n### Attack scenario\n\nA typical attack scenario is illustrated in the diagram below. The Validator checks whether the attacker-supplied URL is on the blocklist. If not, the URI is passed to the Requester for redirection. The Requester is responsible for sending requests to the hostname specified by the URI.\n\nThis attack occurs when the Validator is the `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI` class and the Requester is the `Browser` (include chrome, firefox and Safari). An attacker can send a malformed URI to the Validator (e.g., `http://browser.check%23%40vulndetector.com/` ). After validation, the Validator finds that the hostname is not on the blocklist. However, the Requester can still send requests to the domain with the hostname `vulndetector.com`.\n\n## PoC\n\npayloads:\n\n```\nhttp://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://vulndetector.com\\\\/\n```\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTML tag scenarios. Below is a poc example. After clicking the button, the browser will open \"browser.check\", and jetty will parse this URL as \"vulndetector.com\".\n\n```\n<a href=\"http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\"></a>\n```\nA comparison of the parsing differences between Jetty and chrome is shown in the table below (note that neither should accept the URI as valid).\n\n| Invalid URI                                       | Jetty            | Chrome        |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTTP 302 Location\n\n| Input                    | Jetty          | Chrome        |\n| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check%5c/ | browser.check\\ | browser.check |\n\nIt is noteworthy that Spring Web also faced similar security vulnerabilities, being affected by the aforementioned four types of payloads. These issues have since been resolved and have been assigned three CVE numbers [3-5].\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is limited to developers that use the Jetty HttpURI directly.  Example: your project implemented a blocklist to block on some hosts based on HttpURI's handling of authority section.  The vulnerability will help attackers bypass the protections that developers have set up for hosts. The vulnerability will lead to **SSRF**[1] and **URL Redirection**[2] vulnerabilities in several cases. \n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe attacks outlined above rely on decoded user data being passed to the `HttpURI` class. Application should not pass decoded user data as an encoded URI to any URI class/method, including `HttpURI`.  Such applications are likely to be vulnerable in other ways. \nThe immediate solution is to upgrade to a version of the class that will fully validate the characters of the URI authority.  Ultimately, Jetty will deprecate and remove support for user info in the authority per [RFC9110 Section 4.2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-4.2.4). \n\nNote that the Chrome (and other browsers) parse the invalid user info section improperly as well (due to flawed WhatWG URL parsing rules that do not apply outside of a Web Browser).\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html\n[2] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html",

No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39140](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39140.html).\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by Lai Han of nsfocus security team.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n",

      "description": "Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be very slow.  Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.  An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.  When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).  With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.  Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed data.  Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low.  In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.  The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.  In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern, and the severity is therefore considered low.",

      "description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.15.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe reported vulnerability does only exist with a JAX-WS runtime on the classpath.\n\nNo user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still insist to use XStream default blacklist - despite that clear recommendation - can use a workaround depending on their version in use.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 can simply add two lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 to 1.4.13 can simply add three lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.12 to 1.4.7 who want to use XStream with a black list will have to setup such a list from scratch and deny at least the following types: _javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter_, _java.beans.EventHandler_, _java.lang.ProcessBuilder_, _jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString.class_, _java.lang.Void_ and _void_ and deny several types by name pattern.\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\", java.beans.EventHandler.class, java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.lang.Void.class, void.class });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\$LazyIterator\", \"javax\\\\.crypto\\\\..*\", \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:\n```Java\nxstream.registerConverter(new Converter() {\n  public boolean canConvert(Class type) {\n    return type != null && (type == java.beans.EventHandler.class || type == java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class\n        || type.getName().equals(\"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\") || type.getName().equals(\"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\")\n        || type == java.lang.Void.class || void.class || Proxy.isProxy(type))\n        || type.getName().startsWith(\"javax.crypto.\") || type.getName().endsWith(\"$LazyIterator\") || type.getName().endsWith(\".ReadAllStream$FileStream\"));\n  }\n\n  public Object unmarshal(HierarchicalStreamReader reader, UnmarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n\n  public void marshal(Object source, HierarchicalStreamWriter writer, MarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n}, XStream.PRIORITY_LOW);\n```\n  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)",

      "description": "In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).",

      "description": "The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.  The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.  These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.  The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.",

      "description": "The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.  The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.    This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.  Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.  The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.",

When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.",

      "description": "### Impact\nOn Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system.  A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory.  If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files.  If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.\n\nAdditionally, any user code uses of [WebAppContext::getTempDirectory](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.31.v20200723/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#getTempDirectory()) would similarly be vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally, any user application code using the `ServletContext` attribute for the tempdir will also be impacted.\nSee: https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#TEMPDIR\n\nFor example:\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContext;\nimport javax.servlet.ServletException;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\n\npublic class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {\n    @Override\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {\n        File tempDir = (File)getServletContext().getAttribute(ServletContext.TEMPDIR); // Potentially compromised\n        // do something with that temp dir\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample: The JSP library itself will use the container temp directory for compiling the JSP source into Java classes before executing them.\n\n### CVSSv3.1 Evaluation\n\nThis vulnerability has been calculated to have a [CVSSv3.1 score of 7.8/10 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)\n\n### Patches\nFixes were applied to the 9.4.x branch with:\n- https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/53e0e0e9b25a6309bf24ee3b10984f4145701edb\n- https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/9ad6beb80543b392c91653f6bfce233fc75b9d5f\n\nThese will be included in releases: 9.4.33, 10.0.0.beta3, 11.0.0.beta3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA work around is to set a temporary directory, either for the server or the context, to a directory outside of the shared temporary file system.\nFor recent releases, a temporary directory can be created simple by creating a directory called `work` in the ${jetty.base} directory (the parent directory of the `webapps` directory).\nAlternately the java temporary directory can be set with the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`.    A more detailed description of how jetty selects a temporary directory is below.\n\nThe Jetty search order for finding a temporary directory is as follows:\n\n1. If the [`WebAppContext` has a temp directory specified](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/current/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#setTempDirectory(java.io.File)), use it.\n2. If the `ServletContext` has the `javax.servlet.context.tempdir` attribute set, and if directory exists, use it.\n3. If a `${jetty.base}/work` directory exists, use it (since Jetty 9.1)\n4. If a `ServletContext` has the `org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.basetempdir` attribute set, and if the directory exists, use it.\n5. Use `System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\")` and use it.\n\nJetty will end traversal at the first successful step.\nTo mitigate this vulnerability the directory must be set to one that is not writable by an attacker.  To avoid information leakage, the directory should also not be readable by an attacker.\n\n#### Setting a Jetty server temporary directory.\n\nChoices 3 and 5 apply to the server level, and will impact all deployed webapps on the server.\n\nFor choice 3  just create that work directory underneath your `${jetty.base}` and restart Jetty.\n\nFor choice 5, just specify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM for Jetty.\n\n``` shell\n[jetty-distribution]$ java -Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/web/work -jar start.jar\n```\n\n#### Setting a Context specific temporary directory.\n\nThe rest of the choices require you to configure the context for that deployed webapp (seen as `${jetty.base}/webapps/<context>.xml`)\n\nExample (excluding the DTD which is version specific):\n\n``` xml\n<Configure class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext\">\n  <Set name=\"contextPath\"><Property name=\"foo\"/></Set>\n  <Set name=\"war\">/var/web/webapps/foo.war</Set>\n  <Set name=\"tempDirectory\">/var/web/work/foo</Set>\n</Configure>\n```\n\n### References\n \n - https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/5451\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n - [CodeQL Query PR To Detect Similar Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/4473)\n\n### Similar Vulnerabilities\n\nSimilar, but not the same.\n\n - JUnit 4 - https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n - Google Guava - https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\n - Apache Ant - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1945\n - JetBrains Kotlin Compiler - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15824\n\n### For more information\n\nThe original report of this vulnerability is below:\n\n> On Thu, 15 Oct 2020 at 21:14, Jonathan Leitschuh <jonathan.leitschuh@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Hi WebTide Security Team,\n>\n> I'm a security researcher writing some custom CodeQL queries to find Local Temporary Directory Hijacking Vulnerabilities.

      "description": "There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.",

      "description": "Spring Framework, version 5.1, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.10, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.20, and older unsupported versions on the 4.2.x branch provide support for range requests when serving static resources through the ResourceHttpRequestHandler, or starting in 5.0 when an annotated controller returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. A malicious user (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or with wide ranges that overlap, or both, for a denial of service attack. This vulnerability affects applications that depend on either spring-webmvc or spring-webflux. Such applications must also have a registration for serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an annotated controller that returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. Spring Boot applications that depend on spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-webflux are ready to serve static resources out of the box and are therefore vulnerable.",

      "description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.13 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround depending on their version in use.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.13 can simply add two lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.12 to 1.4.7 who want to use XStream with a black list will have to setup such a list from scratch and deny at least the following types: _javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter_, _java.beans.EventHandler_, _java.lang.ProcessBuilder_, _java.lang.Void_ and _void_.\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.beans.EventHandler.class, java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.lang.Void.class, void.class });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:\n```Java\nxstream.registerConverter(new Converter() {\n  public boolean canConvert(Class type) {\n    return type != null && (type == java.beans.EventHandler.class || type == java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class || type == java.lang.Void.class || void.class || type.getName().equals(\"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\") || Proxy.isProxy(type));\n  }\n\n  public Object unmarshal(HierarchicalStreamReader reader, UnmarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n\n  public void marshal(Object source, HierarchicalStreamWriter writer, MarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n}, XStream.PRIORITY_LOW);\n```\n\n### Credits\nChen L found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.  He was supported by Zhihong Tian and Hui Lu, both from Guangzhou University.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2020-26217](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2020-26217.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)",

      "description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.20 handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. Following types of the Java runtime are affected:\n\n- java.util.HashMap\n- java.util.HashSet\n- java.util.Hashtable\n- java.util.LinkedHashMap\n- java.util.LinkedHashSet\n- Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected\n\nA simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.\n\nIf your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n```\n\nIf your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n```Java\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n```\nHowever, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2022-41966](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n",

      "description": "Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons.\n\n\n\nA special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

      "description": "Spring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. \n\n## Impact\n\nA Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).",

      "description": "Spring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. \n\n## Impact\n\nA Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).",

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.",
