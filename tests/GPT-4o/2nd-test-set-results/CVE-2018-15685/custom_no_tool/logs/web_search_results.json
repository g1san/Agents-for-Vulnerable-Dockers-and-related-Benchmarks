    "desc": "CVE-2018-15685 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting applications built with the Electron framework. This flaw is present in Electron versions 3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15. The vulnerability is due to insecure default settings in Electron, where nested child windows can be opened with properties that are not properly inherited through iframes. This allows user-controlled code to access Node.js bindings, leading to potential remote code execution. The issue is triggered when applications use the \"nativeWindowOpen: true\" or \"sandbox: true\" options, and user code runs inside an iframe or can create an iframe. The Electron team has released patched versions to address this issue, and users are advised to upgrade to versions 3.0.0-beta.7, 2.0.8, 1.8.8, or 1.7.16, or to implement specific security measures such as setting \"contextIsolation\" to true and \"nodeIntegration\" to false.",
