    "desc": "CVE-2016-9086 is a vulnerability in GitLab, specifically affecting versions 8.9 through 8.13.2 of both the Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). This vulnerability arises from the improper handling of symbolic links in the import/export project feature, which was introduced in version 8.9.0. The flaw allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files on the server by uploading a crafted tar.gz file during project import. By manipulating symbolic links in the archive, an attacker can access sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd, thereby potentially exposing authentication tokens and escalating their privileges. The vulnerability was addressed by removing symbolic links from import packages and ensuring errors are logged rather than displayed.",
