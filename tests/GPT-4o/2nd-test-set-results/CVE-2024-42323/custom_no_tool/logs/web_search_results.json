    "desc": "CVE-2024-42323 is a critical security vulnerability found in Apache HertzBeat versions prior to 1.6.0. The root cause of this issue is a flaw in the deserialization process of the SnakeYAML library, which fails to properly validate and sanitize YAML content. This vulnerability allows authenticated users to exploit specific API endpoints (/api/monitors/import and /api/alert/defines/import) by submitting malicious YAML files. The deserialization of these untrusted YAML files can lead to the execution of arbitrary Java code on the server, resulting in remote code execution (RCE). This poses a significant security risk as attackers could potentially gain full control over the vulnerable system. The issue has been addressed in version 1.6.0 by updating the SnakeYAML library and implementing better input validation and strict API authorization measures. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.6.0 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.",
