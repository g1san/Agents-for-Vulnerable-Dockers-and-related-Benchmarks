    "desc": "CVE-2019-3396 is a critical vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, specifically within the Widget Connector macro. The vulnerability arises from a server-side template injection flaw, allowing attackers to perform path traversal and execute remote code on affected systems. It is due to improper validation of URL parameters in the Widget Connector macro, which can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the \"/rest/tinymce/1/macro/preview\" endpoint. This can lead to unauthorized file access or execution of arbitrary commands on the server, potentially allowing attackers to gain control over the affected system. The vulnerability affects all versions of Confluence Server and Data Center before 6.6.12, versions 6.7.0 through 6.12.2, versions 6.13.0 through 6.13.2, and versions 6.14.0 through 6.14.1. It has been resolved in versions 6.6.12, 6.12.3, 6.13.3, 6.14.2, and 6.15.1.",
