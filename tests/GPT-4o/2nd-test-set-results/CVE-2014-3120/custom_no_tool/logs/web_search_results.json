    "desc": "CVE-2014-3120 is a vulnerability in Elasticsearch, an open-source search and analytics engine, where versions before 1.2 have a default configuration that enables dynamic scripting. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary MVEL expressions and Java code through the 'source' parameter in the _search function. The vulnerability arises from a misconfiguration that permits unauthorized users to read from and append to files on the system hosting Elasticsearch, assuming the Elasticsearch process has access rights to those files. This issue does not require a web server to exploit and can be demonstrated by saving and running a script locally in a browser. The flaw highlights the importance of securing Elasticsearch configurations and restricting network access to trusted sources to prevent unauthorized exploitation.",
