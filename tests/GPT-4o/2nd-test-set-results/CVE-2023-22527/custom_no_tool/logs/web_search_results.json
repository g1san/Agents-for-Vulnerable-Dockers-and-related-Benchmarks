The vulnerability stems from a template injection flaw, which allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. This issue impacts versions released before December 5, 2023, specifically versions 8.0.x to 8.5.3, excluding the 7.19.x LTS versions. The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating its critical severity. To mitigate the risk, Atlassian advises users to upgrade to the latest versions, such as 8.5.4 (LTS), 8.5.5 (LTS), or newer, as there are no known workarounds.
