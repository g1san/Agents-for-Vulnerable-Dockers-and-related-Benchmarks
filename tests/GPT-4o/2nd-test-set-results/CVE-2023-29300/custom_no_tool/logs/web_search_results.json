    "desc": "CVE-2023-29300 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion versions 2018, 2021, and 2023, which allows for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from unsafe deserialization of Web Distributed Data eXchange (WDDX) packets, which improperly handle user input, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems without prior authentication. This is achieved through Java reflection, enabling the instantiation of classes and invocation of methods based on user-controlled data. A common exploit involves using the `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` class to perform a JNDI injection, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects systems with access to a valid ColdFusion Component (CFC) endpoint and has been actively exploited by cybercriminals, including state-sponsored groups. Adobe has released patches to address this vulnerability and its bypasses, identified as CVE-2023-38203 and CVE-2023-38204. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its severity, and is part of the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.",
