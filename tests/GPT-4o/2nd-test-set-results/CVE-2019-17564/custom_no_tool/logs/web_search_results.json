    "desc": "CVE-2019-17564 is a vulnerability in Apache Dubbo, a Java-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. The issue arises from insecure deserialization in applications with HTTP remote processing enabled. An attacker can exploit this by sending a POST request containing malicious Java objects to the Dubbo Provider instance, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions 2.5.x, 2.6.0 to 2.6.7, and 2.7.0 to 2.7.4.1. It involves the deserialization of Java ObjectStream data without security validation, allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands. The vulnerability is identified as CWE-502, which involves deserializing untrusted data without adequate validation. The severity is rated as moderate, with a high Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) score of 93.465%, indicating a significant likelihood of exploitation within 30 days. To mitigate the issue, users are advised to upgrade to a non-vulnerable version or disable the HTTP protocol in favor of other supported protocols.",
