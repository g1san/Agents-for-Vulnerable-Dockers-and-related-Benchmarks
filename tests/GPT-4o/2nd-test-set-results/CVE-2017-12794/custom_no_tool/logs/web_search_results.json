    "desc": "CVE-2017-12794 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that affects Django's technical 500 debug page. This vulnerability occurs when untrusted data is not properly escaped in the traceback section of the debug page, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. The vulnerability affects Django versions 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5. It is particularly relevant when using the Postgres database with psycopg2, as exceptions can expose field names and values, potentially allowing an attacker to inject scripts. The vulnerability is unlikely to affect most production sites because it requires the DEBUG setting to be True, which is not recommended for production environments.",
