{
    "desc": "CVE-2019-6341 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Drupal content management system, specifically affecting the File module or subsystem. This vulnerability exists in Drupal 7 versions before 7.65, Drupal 8.6 versions before 8.6.13, and Drupal 8.5 versions before 8.5.14. The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a crafted file, such as a fake image file containing HTML and embedded JavaScript. When accessed by other users, this file can trigger an XSS attack, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, phishing, or embedding malicious content. The vulnerability relies on the ability to upload files to a predictable location within the Drupal installation, and it highlights the importance of securing file uploads and properly configuring web applications to prevent unauthorized access and code execution.",
