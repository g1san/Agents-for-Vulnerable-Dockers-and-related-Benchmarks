    "desc": "CVE-2024-36401 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting GeoServer, an open-source software for sharing and editing geospatial data. The vulnerability arises from improper evaluation of user-supplied XPath expressions within the GeoTools library, which GeoServer uses. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting unsafe evaluation of property names as XPath expressions. It affects GeoServer versions prior to 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2, and can be exploited via multiple OGC request parameters such as WFS GetFeature and WMS GetMap. The vulnerability has been actively exploited to deliver malware, including botnets and coin miners, and has a CVSS score of 9.8. To mitigate the risk, users are urged to update their GeoServer instances to the patched versions.",
