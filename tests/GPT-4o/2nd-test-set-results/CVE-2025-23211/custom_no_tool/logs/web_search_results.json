    "desc": "CVE-2025-23211 is a critical vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes application, which is used for meal planning, recipe management, and creating shopping lists. The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Jinja2 template engine, allowing remote code execution. It is caused by unsanitized user input being processed in the template, specifically in the file `recipes/cookbook/helper/template_helper.py`. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially compromising it entirely. The issue is particularly severe when using the provided Docker Compose setup, as it may execute commands with root privileges, leading to potential full system compromise. The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 1.5.23, and is patched in version 1.5.24. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) rates this issue as critical with a score of 10.0, indicating a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Exploiting this vulnerability requires no user interaction and minimal privileges, making it easy for attackers to exploit remotely.",
