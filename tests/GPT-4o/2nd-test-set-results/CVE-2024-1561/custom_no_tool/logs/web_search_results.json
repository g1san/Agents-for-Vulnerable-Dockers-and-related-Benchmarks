    "desc": "CVE-2024-1561 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting Gradio, a Python-based framework for creating web interfaces for machine learning models. The vulnerability exists in Gradio versions 3.47 to 4.12 and is fixed in version 4.13.0. It arises from improper input validation in the /component_server endpoint, allowing attackers to invoke internal methods on the Component class with attacker-controlled arguments. Specifically, the move_resource_to_block_cache() method of the Block class can be exploited to copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory, enabling unauthorized local file read access. This vulnerability is particularly critical when the application is exposed to the internet using launch(share=True), as it allows remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Gradio apps hosted on platforms like Hugging Face are also vulnerable, risking exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables. Mitigations include updating to version 4.13.0, avoiding share=True in production, and implementing security best practices such as input sanitization and limited permissions.",
