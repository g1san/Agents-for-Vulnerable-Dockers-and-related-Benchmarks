    "desc": "CVE-2022-41678 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ related to the Jolokia interface. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to improper handling of requests by the Jolokia API. Specifically, it involves the `org.jolokia.http.AgentServlet` handling requests to `/api/jolokia`, which enables an attacker with authenticated access to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is not due to deserialization but rather the exposure of dangerous MBeans accessible through the Jolokia API. This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.16.0 to 5.16.5 and 5.17.0 to 5.17.3 and has been addressed in versions 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, and 6.0.0. Mitigations include upgrading to a non-vulnerable version, enabling web console authentication, and restricting access to the Jolokia interface. If Jolokia is unnecessary, it can be disabled to prevent exploitation.",
