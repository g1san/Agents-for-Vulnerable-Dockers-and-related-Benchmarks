    "desc": "CVE-2016-1898 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework that allows for multiple types of attacks, including Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), arbitrary file reading, and potentially remote code execution. The issue arises from improper handling of certain crafted media files during playback or conversion processes. This vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions 2.8.5, 2.7.5, 2.6.7, 2.5.10, and 2.6.6. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific media file that, when processed by FFmpeg, can make unauthorized requests to internal services or read sensitive files from the server. This could lead to data exposure, unauthorized access to internal systems, or execution of arbitrary code. The vulnerability is particularly relevant when processing HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 files using the subfile protocol, which can result in external HTTP requests containing arbitrary lines from local files within the URL string. The issue has been addressed in subsequent FFmpeg releases, and users are advised to update to a patched version to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",
