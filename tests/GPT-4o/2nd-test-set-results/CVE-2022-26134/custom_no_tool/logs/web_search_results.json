    "desc": "CVE-2022-26134 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting Atlassian's Confluence Server and Data Center. This vulnerability involves an OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection issue that allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence instance. It was disclosed on June 2, 2022, and affects all supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center prior to the fixed versions (7.4.17, 7.13.7, 7.14.3, 7.15.2, 7.16.4, 7.17.4, and 7.18.1). The vulnerability allows attackers to inject an OGNL payload into the URI of an HTTP request, enabling them to execute code on the server. Atlassian has released patches and a temporary workaround to mitigate the issue. The vulnerability poses a high risk to internet-facing instances and was initially exploited as a zero-day in the wild. Organizations are urged to apply the fixes immediately or disable vulnerable instances.",
