    "desc": "CVE-2017-18349 is a critical vulnerability in the Fastjson library, a popular Java library for JSON processing, developed by Alibaba. The vulnerability is found in versions of Fastjson before 1.2.25. It is caused by insecure deserialization in the `parseObject` function. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending crafted JSON data to a vulnerable application endpoint. The vulnerability arises from the use of the AutoType feature, which allows JSON strings to specify the type of object to be deserialized using the \"@type\" attribute. An attacker can craft a malicious JSON input that specifies an unwanted class with the \"@type\" attribute, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. Exploiting this vulnerability involves setting up a web and RMI service on a target system, using a crafted JSON payload to trigger deserialization in Fastjson, and executing remote commands. This vulnerability can be particularly dangerous as it allows for remote code execution by simply sending a specially crafted JSON payload to an application using a vulnerable version of Fastjson.",
