    "desc": "CVE-2017-12636 is a critical vulnerability affecting both Apache Solr and Apache CouchDB. In Apache Solr, the vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the DataImportHandler (DIH), which allows remote code execution through crafted requests. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the system. In Apache CouchDB, the vulnerability arises from the ability of administrative users to execute arbitrary shell commands by configuring the database server via HTTP(S). This includes specifying paths for operating system-level binaries, enabling the execution of scripts from the public internet. The vulnerability is exacerbated by inconsistencies between CouchDB's Erlang-based JSON parser and the JavaScript-based JSON parser, which can allow non-admin users to gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary commands. Mitigation involves upgrading to CouchDB version 1.7.1 or 2.1.1 and ensuring proper configuration of Solr to disable DIH when not in use.",
