    "desc": "CVE-2021-25646 is a critical security vulnerability found in Apache Druid, a high-performance real-time analytics database. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution by exploiting insufficient input validation in the Druid console. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/druid/indexer/v1/sampler` endpoint, which can execute arbitrary Java code on the server using the `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method. This flaw arises due to a lack of default authentication and improper configuration, which allows unauthorized users to access the Druid console and execute malicious code. The vulnerability affects versions of Apache Druid prior to 0.20.1 and poses a significant risk to systems by potentially compromising their integrity and confidentiality. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to update Apache Druid to version 0.20.1 or later and implement proper authentication and input validation measures.",
