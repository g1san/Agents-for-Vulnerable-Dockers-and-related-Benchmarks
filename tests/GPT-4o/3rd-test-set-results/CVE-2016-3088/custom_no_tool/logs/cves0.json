      "description": "Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.\n\nIf Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered.\n\nSo, a cookie header such as:\n\n`DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` and a value of `b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d`\n\ninstead of 3 separate cookies.\n\n### Impact\nThis has security implications because if, say, `JSESSIONID` is an `HttpOnly` cookie, and the `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the `JSESSIONID` cookie into the `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE` cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server.\n\n### Patches\n* 9.4.51.v20230217 - via PR #9352\n* 10.0.15 - via PR #9339\n* 11.0.15 - via PR #9339\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds\n\n### References\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2965\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265\n",

The OP has also identified that during the call to `sessionDestroyed`, the `getLastAccessedTime()` throws an `IllegalStateException`, which potentially contrary to the servlet spec, so applications calling this method may always throw and fail to log out.  If such an application was only tested on a non clustered test environment, then it may be deployed on a clustered environment with multiple contexts and fail to log out.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe application should catch all Throwables within their `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` implementations.\n",

This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. For example, if a request references a binary called file” name “here, the escaping algorithm will generate the command line string “file” name “here”, which will invoke the binary named file, not the one that the user requested.\n\n```java\nif (execCmd.length() > 0 && execCmd.charAt(0) != '\"' && execCmd.contains(\" \"))\nexecCmd = \"\\\"\" + execCmd + \"\\\"\";\n```\n\n### Exploit Scenario\nThe cgi-bin directory contains a binary named exec and a subdirectory named exec” commands, which contains a file called bin1. The user sends to the CGI servlet a request for the filename exec” commands/bin1. This request will pass the file existence check on lines 194 through 205. The servlet will add quotation marks around this filename, resulting in the command line string “exec” commands/bin1”. When this string is passed to Runtime.exec, instead of executing the bin1 binary, the server will execute the exec\nbinary with the argument commands/file1”. In addition to being incorrect, this behavior may bypass alias checks, and it may cause other unintended behaviors if a command prefix is configured.\n\nIf the useFullPath configuration setting is off, the command need not pass the existence check. The attack would not rely on a binary and subdirectory having similar names, and the attack will succeed on a much wider variety of directory structures.\n\n### Impact\nUsers of the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet with a very specific command structure may have the wrong command executed.\n\n### Patches\nNo patch.\nIn Jetty 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been deprecated.\nIn Jetty 12 (all environments) the `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` has been entirely removed.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet should not be used.

An attacker might exploit\n> this vulnerability in order to achieve SSRF or cause a denial of service.\n> One possible scenario is importing a (remote) malicious WAR into a Jetty’s server, while the\n> WAR includes a malicious web.xml.\n\n### Impact\nThere are no circumstances in a normally deployed Jetty server where potentially hostile XML is given to the XmlParser class without the attacker already having arbitrary access to the server. I.e. in order to exploit `XmlParser` the attacker would already have the ability to deploy and execute hostile code.  Specifically, Jetty has no protection against malicious web application and potentially hostile web applications should only be run on an isolated virtualisation.  \n\nThus this is not considered a vulnerability of the Jetty server itself, as any such usage of the jetty XmlParser is equally vulnerable as a direct usage of the JVM supplied SAX parser.  No CVE will be allocated to this advisory.\n\nHowever, any direct usage of the `XmlParser` class by an application may be vulnerable.  The impact would greatly depend on how the application uses `XmlParser`, but it could be a denial of service due to large entity expansion, or possibly the revealing local files if the XML results are accessible remotely.\n\n### Patches\nAbility to configure the SAXParserFactory to fit the needs of your particular XML parser implementation have been merged as part of PR #10067\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use `XmlParser` to parse data from users.\n\n\n",

      "message": "CVE-2025-49128 on com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core@2.6.3",
      "description": "### Overview\n\nA flaw in Jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible **information disclosure** in systems using **pooled or reused buffers**, like Netty or Vert.x.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability affects the creation of exception messages like:\n\n```\nJsonParseException: Unexpected character ... at [Source: (byte[])...]\n```\n\nWhen `JsonFactory.createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len)` is used, and an error occurs while parsing, the exception message should include a snippet from the specified logical payload. However, the method `_appendSourceDesc` ignores the `offset`, and always starts reading from index `0`.\n\nIf the buffer contains residual sensitive data from a previous request, such as credentials or document contents, that data may be exposed if the exception is propagated to the client.\n\nThe issue particularly impacts server applications using:\n\n* Pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty)\n* Frameworks that surface parse errors in HTTP responses\n* Default Jackson settings (i.e., `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` is enabled)\n\nA documented real-world example is [CVE-2021-22145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145) in Elasticsearch, which stemmed from the same root cause.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker sends malformed JSON to a service using Jackson and pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty-based HTTP servers). If the server reuses a buffer and includes the parser’s exception in its HTTP 400 response, the attacker may receive residual data from previous requests.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1000];\nSystem.arraycopy(\"SECRET\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 0, 6);\nSystem.arraycopy(\"{ \\\"bad\\\": }\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 700, 10);\n\nJsonFactory factory = new JsonFactory();\nJsonParser parser = factory.createParser(buffer, 700, 20);\nparser.nextToken(); // throws exception\n\n// Exception message will include \"SECRET\"\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via [PR #652](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652).\n\nAll users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by:\n\n1. **Disabling exception message exposure to clients** — avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses.\n2. **Disabling source inclusion in exceptions** by setting:\n\n   ```java\n   jsonFactory.disable(JsonFactory.Feature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION);\n   ```\n\n    This prevents Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\n\n### References\n* [Pull Request #652 (Fix implementation)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652)\n* [CVE-2021-22145 (Elasticsearch exposure of this flaw)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145)",

For example a request to the `ConcatServlet` with a URI of `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.\n\nThis occurs because both `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` decode the supplied path to verify it is not within the `WEB-INF` or `META-INF` directories. It then uses this decoded path to call `RequestDispatcher` which will also do decoding of the path. This double decoding allows paths with a doubly encoded `WEB-INF` to bypass this security check.\n\n### Impact\nThis affects all versions of `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` in versions before 9.4.41, 10.0.3 and 11.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot update to the latest version of Jetty, you can instead deploy your own version of the [`ConcatServlet`](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/4204526d2fdad355e233f6bf18a44bfe028ee00b/jetty-servlets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/ConcatServlet.java) and/or the [`WelcomeFilter`](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/4204526d2fdad355e233f6bf18a44bfe028ee00b/jetty-servlets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/WelcomeFilter.java) by using the code from the latest version of Jetty.\n",

Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.

So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround as there is no known exploit scenario. \n\n### Original Report \n\n[RFC 9110 Secion 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6) defined the value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits. However we found that Jetty accepts \"+\" prefixed Content-Length, which could lead to potential HTTP request smuggling.\n\nPayload:\n\n```\n POST / HTTP/1.1\n Host: a.com\n Content-Length: +16\n Connection: close\n ​\n 0123456789abcdef\n```\n\nWhen sending this payload to Jetty, it can successfully parse and identify the length.\n\nWhen sending this payload to NGINX, Apache HTTPd or other HTTP servers/parsers, they will return 400 bad request.\n\nThis behavior can lead to HTTP request smuggling and can be leveraged to bypass WAF or IDS.",

Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM.\n\niq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5, but in the long term users should prefer migrating to the Snappy implementation in https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor (version 0.27 or newer).\n\n### Impact\nWhen uncompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM.\n",

By repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the server's memory finally.\n\n\nVulnerability details\nThe Jetty DoSFilter (Denial of Service Filter) is a security filter designed to protect web applications against certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behavior. It helps to mitigate excessive resource consumption by limiting the rate at which clients can make requests to the server.  The DoSFilter monitors and tracks client request patterns, including request rates, and can take actions such as blocking or delaying requests from clients that exceed predefined thresholds.  The internal tracking of requests in DoSFilter is the source of this OutOfMemory condition.\n\n\nImpact\nUsers of the DoSFilter may be subject to DoS attacks that will ultimately exhaust the memory of the server if they have not configured session passivation or an aggressive session inactivation timeout.\n\n\nPatches\nThe DoSFilter has been patched in all active releases to no longer support the session tracking mode, even if configured.\n\n\nPatched releases:\n\n  *  9.4.54\n  *  10.0.18\n  *  11.0.18\n  *  12.0.3",

      "description": "## Summary\n\nEclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.\n\n## Details\n\n### Affected components\n\nThe vulnerable component is the `HttpURI` class when used as a utility class in an application.  The Jetty usage of the class is not vulnerable.\n\n### Attack overview\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does not well validate the authority section of a URI. When presented with an illegal authority that may contain user info (eg username:password#@hostname:port), then the parsing of the URI is not failed.  Moreover, the interpretation of what part of the authority is the host name differs from a common browser in  that they also do not fail, but they select a different host name from the illegal URI.\n\n### Attack scenario\n\nA typical attack scenario is illustrated in the diagram below. The Validator checks whether the attacker-supplied URL is on the blocklist. If not, the URI is passed to the Requester for redirection. The Requester is responsible for sending requests to the hostname specified by the URI.\n\nThis attack occurs when the Validator is the `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI` class and the Requester is the `Browser` (include chrome, firefox and Safari). An attacker can send a malformed URI to the Validator (e.g., `http://browser.check%23%40vulndetector.com/` ). After validation, the Validator finds that the hostname is not on the blocklist. However, the Requester can still send requests to the domain with the hostname `vulndetector.com`.\n\n## PoC\n\npayloads:\n\n```\nhttp://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://vulndetector.com\\\\/\n```\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTML tag scenarios. Below is a poc example. After clicking the button, the browser will open \"browser.check\", and jetty will parse this URL as \"vulndetector.com\".\n\n```\n<a href=\"http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\"></a>\n```\nA comparison of the parsing differences between Jetty and chrome is shown in the table below (note that neither should accept the URI as valid).\n\n| Invalid URI                                       | Jetty            | Chrome        |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTTP 302 Location\n\n| Input                    | Jetty          | Chrome        |\n| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check%5c/ | browser.check\\ | browser.check |\n\nIt is noteworthy that Spring Web also faced similar security vulnerabilities, being affected by the aforementioned four types of payloads. These issues have since been resolved and have been assigned three CVE numbers [3-5].\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is limited to developers that use the Jetty HttpURI directly.  Example: your project implemented a blocklist to block on some hosts based on HttpURI's handling of authority section.  The vulnerability will help attackers bypass the protections that developers have set up for hosts. The vulnerability will lead to **SSRF**[1] and **URL Redirection**[2] vulnerabilities in several cases. \n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe attacks outlined above rely on decoded user data being passed to the `HttpURI` class. Application should not pass decoded user data as an encoded URI to any URI class/method, including `HttpURI`.  Such applications are likely to be vulnerable in other ways. \nThe immediate solution is to upgrade to a version of the class that will fully validate the characters of the URI authority.  Ultimately, Jetty will deprecate and remove support for user info in the authority per [RFC9110 Section 4.2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-4.2.4). \n\nNote that the Chrome (and other browsers) parse the invalid user info section improperly as well (due to flawed WhatWG URL parsing rules that do not apply outside of a Web Browser).\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html\n[2] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html",

      "description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.15.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe reported vulnerability does only exist with a JAX-WS runtime on the classpath.\n\nNo user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still insist to use XStream default blacklist - despite that clear recommendation - can use a workaround depending on their version in use.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 can simply add two lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 to 1.4.13 can simply add three lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.12 to 1.4.7 who want to use XStream with a black list will have to setup such a list from scratch and deny at least the following types: _javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter_, _java.beans.EventHandler_, _java.lang.ProcessBuilder_, _jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString.class_, _java.lang.Void_ and _void_ and deny several types by name pattern.\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\", java.beans.EventHandler.class, java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.lang.Void.class, void.class });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\$LazyIterator\", \"javax\\\\.crypto\\\\..*\", \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:\n```Java\nxstream.registerConverter(new Converter() {\n  public boolean canConvert(Class type) {\n    return type != null && (type == java.beans.EventHandler.class || type == java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class\n        || type.getName().equals(\"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\") || type.getName().equals(\"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\")\n        || type == java.lang.Void.class || void.class || Proxy.isProxy(type))\n        || type.getName().startsWith(\"javax.crypto.\") || type.getName().endsWith(\"$LazyIterator\") || type.getName().endsWith(\".ReadAllStream$FileStream\"));\n  }\n\n  public Object unmarshal(HierarchicalStreamReader reader, UnmarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n\n  public void marshal(Object source, HierarchicalStreamWriter writer, MarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n}, XStream.PRIORITY_LOW);\n```\n  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)",

      "description": "### Impact\nOn Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system.  A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory.  If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files.  If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.\n\nAdditionally, any user code uses of [WebAppContext::getTempDirectory](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.31.v20200723/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#getTempDirectory()) would similarly be vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally, any user application code using the `ServletContext` attribute for the tempdir will also be impacted.\nSee: https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#TEMPDIR\n\nFor example:\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContext;\nimport javax.servlet.ServletException;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\n\npublic class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {\n    @Override\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {\n        File tempDir = (File)getServletContext().getAttribute(ServletContext.TEMPDIR); // Potentially compromised\n        // do something with that temp dir\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample: The JSP library itself will use the container temp directory for compiling the JSP source into Java classes before executing them.\n\n### CVSSv3.1 Evaluation\n\nThis vulnerability has been calculated to have a [CVSSv3.1 score of 7.8/10 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)\n\n### Patches\nFixes were applied to the 9.4.x branch with:\n- https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/53e0e0e9b25a6309bf24ee3b10984f4145701edb\n- https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/9ad6beb80543b392c91653f6bfce233fc75b9d5f\n\nThese will be included in releases: 9.4.33, 10.0.0.beta3, 11.0.0.beta3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA work around is to set a temporary directory, either for the server or the context, to a directory outside of the shared temporary file system.\nFor recent releases, a temporary directory can be created simple by creating a directory called `work` in the ${jetty.base} directory (the parent directory of the `webapps` directory).\nAlternately the java temporary directory can be set with the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`.    A more detailed description of how jetty selects a temporary directory is below.\n\nThe Jetty search order for finding a temporary directory is as follows:\n\n1. If the [`WebAppContext` has a temp directory specified](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/current/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html#setTempDirectory(java.io.File)), use it.\n2. If the `ServletContext` has the `javax.servlet.context.tempdir` attribute set, and if directory exists, use it.\n3. If a `${jetty.base}/work` directory exists, use it (since Jetty 9.1)\n4. If a `ServletContext` has the `org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.basetempdir` attribute set, and if the directory exists, use it.\n5. Use `System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\")` and use it.\n\nJetty will end traversal at the first successful step.\nTo mitigate this vulnerability the directory must be set to one that is not writable by an attacker.  To avoid information leakage, the directory should also not be readable by an attacker.\n\n#### Setting a Jetty server temporary directory.\n\nChoices 3 and 5 apply to the server level, and will impact all deployed webapps on the server.\n\nFor choice 3  just create that work directory underneath your `${jetty.base}` and restart Jetty.\n\nFor choice 5, just specify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM for Jetty.\n\n``` shell\n[jetty-distribution]$ java -Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/web/work -jar start.jar\n```\n\n#### Setting a Context specific temporary directory.\n\nThe rest of the choices require you to configure the context for that deployed webapp (seen as `${jetty.base}/webapps/<context>.xml`)\n\nExample (excluding the DTD which is version specific):\n\n``` xml\n<Configure class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext\">\n  <Set name=\"contextPath\"><Property name=\"foo\"/></Set>\n  <Set name=\"war\">/var/web/webapps/foo.war</Set>\n  <Set name=\"tempDirectory\">/var/web/work/foo</Set>\n</Configure>\n```\n\n### References\n \n - https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/5451\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n - [CodeQL Query PR To Detect Similar Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/4473)\n\n### Similar Vulnerabilities\n\nSimilar, but not the same.\n\n - JUnit 4 - https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n - Google Guava - https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\n - Apache Ant - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1945\n - JetBrains Kotlin Compiler - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15824\n\n### For more information\n\nThe original report of this vulnerability is below:\n\n> On Thu, 15 Oct 2020 at 21:14, Jonathan Leitschuh <jonathan.leitschuh@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Hi WebTide Security Team,\n>\n> I'm a security researcher writing some custom CodeQL queries to find Local Temporary Directory Hijacking Vulnerabilities.

The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception.

Following types of the Java runtime are affected in Java versions available in December 2021:\n\n- java.util.HashMap\n- java.util.HashSet\n- java.util.Hashtable\n- java.util.LinkedHashMap\n- java.util.LinkedHashSet\n- java.util.Stack (older Java revisions only)\n- java.util.Vector (older Java revisions only)\n- Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected\n\nIf your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n```\n\nIf your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n```Java\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n```\nHowever, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-43859](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-43859.html).\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by r00t4dm at Cloud-Penetrating Arrow Lab.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)",

      "description": "In FasterXML jackson-databind 2.4.0-rc1 until 2.12.7.1 and in 2.13.x before 2.13.4.2 resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper array nesting, when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled. This was patched in 2.12.7.1, 2.13.4.2, and 2.14.0.\n\nCommits that introduced vulnerable code are \nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d499f2e7bbc5ebd63af11e1f5cf1989fa323aa45, https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/0e37a39502439ecbaa1a5b5188387c01bf7f7fa1, and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7ba9ac5b87a9d6ac0d2815158ecbeb315ad4dcdc.\n\nFix commits are https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/cd090979b7ea78c75e4de8a4aed04f7e9fa8deea and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d78d00ee7b5245b93103fef3187f70543d67ca33.\n\nThe `2.13.4.1` release does fix this issue, however it also references a non-existent jackson-bom which causes build failures for gradle users. See https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3627#issuecomment-1277957548 for details. This is fixed in `2.13.4.2` which is listed in the advisory metadata so that users are not subjected to unnecessary build failures",

Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.13 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround depending on their version in use.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.13 can simply add two lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.12 to 1.4.7 who want to use XStream with a black list will have to setup such a list from scratch and deny at least the following types: _javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter_, _java.beans.EventHandler_, _java.lang.ProcessBuilder_, _java.lang.Void_ and _void_.\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.beans.EventHandler.class, java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.lang.Void.class, void.class });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:\n```Java\nxstream.registerConverter(new Converter() {\n  public boolean canConvert(Class type) {\n    return type != null && (type == java.beans.EventHandler.class || type == java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class || type == java.lang.Void.class || void.class || type.getName().equals(\"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\") || Proxy.isProxy(type));\n  }\n\n  public Object unmarshal(HierarchicalStreamReader reader, UnmarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n\n  public void marshal(Object source, HierarchicalStreamWriter writer, MarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n}, XStream.PRIORITY_LOW);\n```\n\n### Credits\nChen L found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.  He was supported by Zhihong Tian and Hui Lu, both from Guangzhou University.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2020-26217](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2020-26217.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)",

      "description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.20 handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. Following types of the Java runtime are affected:\n\n- java.util.HashMap\n- java.util.HashSet\n- java.util.Hashtable\n- java.util.LinkedHashMap\n- java.util.LinkedHashSet\n- Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected\n\nA simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.\n\nIf your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n```\n\nIf your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n```Java\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n```\nHowever, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2022-41966](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n",

      "description": "Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons.\n\n\n\nA special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.",
