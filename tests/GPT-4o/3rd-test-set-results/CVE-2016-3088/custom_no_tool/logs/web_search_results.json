    "desc": "CVE-2016-3088 is a critical security vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, specifically affecting versions 5.x before 5.14.0. The vulnerability resides in the Fileserver web application component of ActiveMQ, which allows users to upload files using HTTP methods. The flaw is due to insufficient restrictions on the file upload paths, enabling attackers to upload malicious files and execute them remotely. This is achieved through an HTTP PUT request to upload a file, followed by an HTTP MOVE request to relocate the file to a directory with execution permissions. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution, posing a significant risk to affected systems. It was publicly disclosed in June 2016 and has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, reflecting its critical nature. Users are advised to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.14.0 or later, where the Fileserver function has been removed, or to disable the Fileserver function in the configuration file to mitigate this issue.",
