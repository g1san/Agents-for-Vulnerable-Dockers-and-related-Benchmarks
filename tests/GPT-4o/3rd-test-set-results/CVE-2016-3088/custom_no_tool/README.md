# CVE-2016-3088 Vulnerable Environment

This setup contains a Docker environment vulnerable to CVE-2016-3088, which affects Apache ActiveMQ versions before 5.14.0.

## Setup

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
3. Run `docker compose up` to start the services.

## Services

- **ActiveMQ**: Available at `http://localhost:8161` with default credentials `admin:admin`.

## Notes

- This setup is for educational and testing purposes only. Do not use it in production environments.
- The ActiveMQ web console is exposed on port 8161, and the OpenWire transport is on port 61616.
- The configuration allows file uploads via the HTTP connector, which is the vector for the vulnerability.

## Exploitation

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can use HTTP PUT and MOVE requests to upload and execute a malicious file on the server. This setup does not include exploitation scripts but provides the vulnerable environment.
