    "desc": "CVE-2019-6116 is a critical vulnerability in Ghostscript, a suite of software used for processing PostScript and PDF files. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running vulnerable versions of Ghostscript. This can be achieved by submitting a specially crafted file to the Ghostscript interpreter, which processes the file and executes unintended commands, bypassing the security sandbox. The vulnerability affects Ghostscript versions up to 9.26 and involves the mishandling of ephemeral or transient procedures, which can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions. The issue was discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy and was addressed by Artifex with patches released on January 23, 2019. Ghostscript is often used in web applications and services that automatically process PDF or PostScript files, making this vulnerability particularly dangerous as it could allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized access or control over systems. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to update to Ghostscript version 9.27 or later, or disable the parsing of PS files.",
