    "desc": "CVE-2014-3704, also known as 'Drupageddon,' is a critical SQL injection vulnerability found in Drupal versions 7.0 up to, but not including, 7.32. This vulnerability arises from improper construction of prepared statements in the expandArguments function of Drupal's database abstraction API. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by sending specially crafted requests. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation, and potentially remote code execution. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to inject SQL commands and create a new Drupal administrator user, enabling further manipulation such as enabling the PHP filter module and executing arbitrary PHP code. This makes it a severe security concern for websites using affected Drupal versions.",
