    "desc": "CVE-2016-1897 is a critical vulnerability in FFmpeg, a widely-used open-source multimedia framework. This vulnerability arises from improper validation of user-supplied data, specifically in the handling of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) m3u8 files. The flaw allows for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and arbitrary file read vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code or read files on the server. By crafting a malicious m3u8 file, an attacker can trick FFmpeg into making unauthorized HTTP requests or accessing internal files. This is due to FFmpeg not properly sanitizing the stream addresses within the m3u8 file, which are executed directly. The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions prior to 2.8.5, 2.7.5, and 2.6.7, and can be exploited when a website processes user-uploaded multimedia files using FFmpeg, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
