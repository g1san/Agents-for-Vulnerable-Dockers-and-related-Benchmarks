{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-9402 is a security vulnerability in Django, an open-source web application framework based on Python. This vulnerability is a SQL injection issue, specifically affecting GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle databases. It arises when untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter in these functions, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL commands. Versions of Django affected by this vulnerability include 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4. The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting specific SQL queries to manipulate database information, such as viewing, adding, modifying, or deleting data. The issue was addressed by adding validation to ensure the tolerance parameter is numeric, preventing SQL injection attacks.",
