    "desc": "CVE-2019-6341 is a vulnerability in Drupal, a PHP-based content management framework, where improper validation of user input in certain fields can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution on the server. This vulnerability is particularly associated with the RESTful web services and file upload functionalities in Drupal. Exploitation requires access to an account with permission to use these services, allowing an attacker to upload files that can execute malicious scripts. This issue affects Drupal 7 versions prior to 7.65, Drupal 8.6 versions prior to 8.6.13, and Drupal 8.5 versions prior to 8.5.14. The vulnerability enables cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by allowing attackers to upload files containing HTML and JavaScript code, which can execute in the context of another user's session, leading to unauthorized actions and data breaches.",
