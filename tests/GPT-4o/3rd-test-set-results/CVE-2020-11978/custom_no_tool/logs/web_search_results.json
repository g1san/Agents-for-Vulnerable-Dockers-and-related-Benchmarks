    "desc": "CVE-2020-11978 is a remote code execution vulnerability found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and earlier. The vulnerability is located in the example Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) included with Apache Airflow. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to command injection possibilities through the experimental REST API, which is accessible publicly by default. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable Apache Airflow software. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users if the example DAGs are loaded, as the default authentication backend permits unauthenticated API access. To mitigate this vulnerability, users should either disable the loading of example DAGs by setting `load_examples=False` in the configuration or upgrade to version 1.10.11 or later. Additionally, access to the experimental API should be restricted by setting `auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all`. In versions 2.0.0 and above, the experimental API has been replaced with a more secure stable API.",
