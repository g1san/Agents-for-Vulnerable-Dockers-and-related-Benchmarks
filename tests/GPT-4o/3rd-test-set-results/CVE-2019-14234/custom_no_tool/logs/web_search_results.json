    "desc": "CVE-2019-14234 is a SQL injection vulnerability found in Django's JSONField and HStoreField model fields. Disclosed on August 1, 2019, this vulnerability allows attackers to inject SQL through the field name of a queryset if these fields are used. It affects Django versions 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. The issue arises from shallow key transformation errors affecting key and index lookups in `django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField` and key lookups in `django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField`. Exploitation is straightforward via Django's built-in Django-Admin application, where an attacker can manipulate filter parameter names to perform SQL injection, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation. This vulnerability does not require user interaction or prior access privileges, making it remotely exploitable. To mitigate this issue, upgrading Django to patched versions 1.11.23, 2.1.11, 2.2.4, or higher is recommended.",
