    "desc": "CVE-2021-26084 is a critical security vulnerability found in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center. It is an OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of Unicode characters and an insufficient denylist of code definitions, which can be exploited via HTML fields processed by OGNL. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited remotely, allowing attackers to gain control over vulnerable systems without needing authentication. The affected versions are all versions before 6.13.23, versions 6.14.0 to 7.4.10, versions 7.5.0 to 7.11.5, and versions 7.12.0 to 7.12.4. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its criticality, and has been actively exploited in the wild. Atlassian has released patches to address this issue in versions 6.13.23, 7.4.11, 7.11.6, 7.12.5, and 7.13.0.",
