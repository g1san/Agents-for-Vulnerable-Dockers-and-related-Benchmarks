{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-1297 is a vulnerability found in Apache JMeter versions 2.x and 3.x. This vulnerability arises when JMeter is configured to use Distributed Testing with Remote Method Invocation (RMI) based connections. The issue is that these RMI connections are unsecured, which means they do not have any form of authentication or encryption. As a result, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining unauthorized access to the JMeterEngine via the unsecured RMI connection. Once access is gained, the attacker could execute unauthorized code, potentially compromising the entire system.",
