    "desc": "CVE-2015-1427 is a critical vulnerability in Elasticsearch, a distributed search and analytics engine, affecting versions before 1.3.8 and 1.4.x before 1.4.3. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary scripts due to a flaw in the Groovy scripting engine, which was enabled by default. This flaw arises from the _search API endpoint, which permits users to submit Groovy code within search queries. Although intended to run in a sandbox environment, the vulnerability allows attackers to bypass these restrictions using Java reflection, specifically through methods like `java.lang.Math.class.forName`, to reference arbitrary classes and execute arbitrary Java code. This results in unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data compromise. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the lack of built-in authentication controls in Elasticsearch and the default configuration that exposes the service publicly, making it highly susceptible to exploitation. The issue was mitigated in later versions by disabling dynamic scripting by default.",
