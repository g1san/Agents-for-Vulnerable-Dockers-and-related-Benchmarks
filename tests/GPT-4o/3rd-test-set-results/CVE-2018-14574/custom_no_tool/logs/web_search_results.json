    "desc": "CVE-2018-14574 is an open redirect vulnerability found in Django's CommonMiddleware when the APPEND_SLASH setting is enabled. This vulnerability allows attackers to craft URLs that can redirect users to arbitrary external sites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities. The issue arises because the middleware does not properly validate the scheme of the redirect URL, allowing redirects to unintended locations. This vulnerability affects Django versions 1.11.0 to 1.11.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.8. It is classified under CWE-601, related to open redirection issues. The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to patched versions of Django or implementing input validation to ensure that redirections are only allowed to trusted domains.",
