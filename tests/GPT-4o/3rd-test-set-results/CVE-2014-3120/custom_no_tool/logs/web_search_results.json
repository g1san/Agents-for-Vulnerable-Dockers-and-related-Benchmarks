{
    "desc": "CVE-2014-3120 is a vulnerability in Elasticsearch, an open-source search and analytics engine. This vulnerability is due to the default configuration in Elasticsearch versions 1.1.1 and 1.2, which enables dynamic scripting. This feature can be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by using the source parameter in the _search API. The vulnerability allows attackers to run malicious scripts, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over the server. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of access roles or authentication, and the HTTP-accessible API without CSRF protection. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read from and append to files on the system where Elasticsearch is running, assuming the user running Elasticsearch has the appropriate file access permissions. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to disable dynamic scripting or upgrade to a version of Elasticsearch where this vulnerability is patched.",
