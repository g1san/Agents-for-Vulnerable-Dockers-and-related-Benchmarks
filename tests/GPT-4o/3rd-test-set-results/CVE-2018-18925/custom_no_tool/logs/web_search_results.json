{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-18925 is a critical security vulnerability found in Gogs, a self-hosted Git service. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of session IDs in the go-macaron/session library, which allows for directory traversal attacks. This flaw permits an attacker to manipulate session identifiers to access unauthorized files and potentially log into arbitrary user accounts, including administrator accounts. By crafting a malicious session ID, an attacker can read arbitrary files and bypass authentication. Once authenticated, the attacker can exploit the git hooks functionality to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects Gogs versions up to 0.11.66 and allows attackers to gain unauthorized access and control over the system, posing significant security risks.",
