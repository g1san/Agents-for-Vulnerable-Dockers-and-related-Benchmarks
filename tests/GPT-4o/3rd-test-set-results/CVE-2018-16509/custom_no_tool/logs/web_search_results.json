    "desc": "CVE-2018-16509 is a vulnerability in Artifex Ghostscript versions prior to 9.24, where incorrect handling of privilege restoration during the processing of /invalidaccess exceptions could allow attackers to bypass the -dSAFER mode. This bypass enables arbitrary command execution through a crafted PostScript file. The vulnerability can be exploited through libraries that utilize Ghostscript, such as ImageMagick or the Python imaging library PIL/Pillow, which process EPS files. The issue arises from incorrect privilege checking, allowing the execution of commands using the \"pipe\" instruction. This vulnerability is critical as it affects systems where Ghostscript is installed, potentially as a dependency, and can lead to unauthorized command execution by processing a malicious EPS file.",
