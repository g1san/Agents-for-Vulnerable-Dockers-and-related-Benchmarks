    "desc": "CVE-2017-9993 is a vulnerability found in FFmpeg, a popular multimedia framework used for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions prior to 2.8.12, 3.0.x before 3.1.9, 3.2.x before 3.2.6, and 3.3.x before 3.3.2. It arises from improper restrictions on HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) filename extensions and demuxer names, which can be exploited by attackers to read arbitrary files through crafted playlist data. This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. The issue allows for arbitrary read access and can lead to unauthorized information disclosure. Additionally, it can cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially allow for the execution of arbitrary code when processing untrusted media files. Users are advised to update to the latest FFmpeg versions to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.",
