{
    "desc": "CVE-2023-46604 is a critical security vulnerability affecting both Apache ActiveMQ Classic and Artemis brokers due to unsafe deserialization practices in the Java OpenWire protocol marshaller. This flaw allows remote code execution, enabling a remote attacker with network access to execute arbitrary code on the server running ActiveMQ. The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating serialized class types in OpenWire commands. ActiveMQ Classic is particularly vulnerable as it ships with Spring dependencies, which can be exploited to load malicious XML configuration files. Although ActiveMQ Artemis includes the vulnerable code, it does not ship with Spring, making it less susceptible to exploitation. Users are urged to upgrade to safer versions to mitigate this risk.",
