    "desc": "CVE-2023-22527 is a critical vulnerability in older versions of Confluence Data Center and Server, specifically versions 8.0.x, 8.2.x, 8.3.x, 8.4.x, and 8.5.0 up to 8.5.3, released before December 5, 2023. This vulnerability is a result of a template injection flaw, which allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The issue arises from inadequate input validation in the template engine used by Confluence, which can be exploited by sending specially crafted requests to vulnerable endpoints. Due to its critical nature, the vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, and immediate patching to the latest versions is strongly recommended by Atlassian. The vulnerability has been observed being exploited in the wild, emphasizing the urgency for users to update their systems to mitigate potential risks.",
