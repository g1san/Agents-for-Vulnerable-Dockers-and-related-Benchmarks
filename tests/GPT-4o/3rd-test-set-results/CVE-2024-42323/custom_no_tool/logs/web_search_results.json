    "desc": "CVE-2024-42323 is a critical vulnerability found in Apache HertzBeat (incubating) versions prior to 1.6.0. The vulnerability arises from the use of SnakeYaml for XML deserialization, which can be exploited by authorized attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely. This remote code execution vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it allows attackers with access privileges to run malicious code on the host system, potentially leading to system compromise. The vulnerability is addressed in version 1.6.0, and users are advised to upgrade to this version to mitigate the risk.",
