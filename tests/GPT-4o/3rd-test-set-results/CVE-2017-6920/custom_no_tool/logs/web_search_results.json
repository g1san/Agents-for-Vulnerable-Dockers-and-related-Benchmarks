    "desc": "CVE-2017-6920 is a critical vulnerability in Drupal, a widely used content management system. The issue arises from insufficient validation and improper handling of user input in the YAML parser of Drupal Core. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `core/lib/Drupal/Component/Serialization/YamlPecl.php` file. It involves the unsafe deserialization of PHP objects when input starts with `!php/object`, leading to a deserialization flaw. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code remotely by crafting a payload that takes advantage of this flaw. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must serialize a `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream` class with a YAML `!php/object` tag and import the malicious YAML configuration through the Drupal admin interface. This vulnerability affects Drupal versions earlier than 8.3.4, and it is recommended to update to the latest version to mitigate the risk.",
