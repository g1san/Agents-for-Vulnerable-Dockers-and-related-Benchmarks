    "desc": "CVE-2018-1000533 is a vulnerability found in GitList, which is a PHP-based graphical tool for viewing Git repositories. This vulnerability is specifically present in version 0.6.0 and earlier. The issue arises from a command parameter injection flaw in the `searchTree` function, where improperly sanitized input is passed to a system function. This flaw can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to remote command execution. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted POST request through the search form, which allows them to inject a web shell into the website directory. Once the web shell is injected, attackers can execute further commands, such as retrieving sensitive information or performing other malicious operations.",
