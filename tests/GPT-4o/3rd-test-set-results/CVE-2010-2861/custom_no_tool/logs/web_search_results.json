    "desc": "CVE-2010-2861 is a vulnerability found in Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier versions. This vulnerability involves multiple directory traversal issues in the administrator console of ColdFusion, allowing remote attackers to read arbitrary files by manipulating the locale parameter in various scripts within the CFIDE/administrator directory, such as settings/mappings.cfm, logging/settings.cfm, datasources/index.cfm, j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm, and enter.cfm. This vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive files, such as password hashes, without proper authorization. Once these hashes are retrieved, attackers can authenticate as an admin without needing to crack the hashes, potentially leading to further exploitation, such as uploading a webshell to modify application files and exfiltrate data. The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-22, which involves improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, allowing path traversal attacks. The vulnerability is rated as high severity, with a high probability of exploitation.",
