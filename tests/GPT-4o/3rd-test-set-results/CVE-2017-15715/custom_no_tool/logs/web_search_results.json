    "desc": "CVE-2017-15715 is a security vulnerability found in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.29. The issue arises from the improper handling of the <FilesMatch> directive, where the '$' character could be incorrectly matched to a newline in a malicious filename, rather than just the end of the filename. This flaw could be exploited in environments that attempt to block certain file uploads by matching only the trailing portion of the filename. As a result, unauthorized files could potentially bypass these restrictions and be uploaded, leading to unauthorized access or file execution.",
