    "desc": "CVE-2022-34265 is a critical vulnerability in the Django web framework, specifically affecting versions 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6. It was disclosed on July 5, 2022, and is characterized by improper string processing in the Trunc() and Extract() database functions. These functions are used for date data handling in SQL execution. The vulnerability allows for arbitrary SQL execution if untrusted data is passed into the 'kind' argument of Trunc() or the 'lookup_name' argument of Extract(). This can lead to unauthorized database access, data modification, or even deletion of database tables. The vulnerability can be exploited using SQL injection techniques, leading to sensitive information disclosure and potential Denial of Service (DoS). The issue has been resolved in Django versions 3.2.14 and 4.0.6. It is recommended to upgrade to these versions to mitigate the vulnerability. The exploit does not affect the MYSQL database backend for the Trunc function. The vulnerability was reported by Takuto Yoshikai from Aeye Security Lab.",
