    "desc": "CVE-2017-7504 is a critical security vulnerability found in the HTTPServerILServlet.java component of the JMS over HTTP Invocation Layer within the JbossMQ implementation. This component is part of the Red Hat Jboss Application Server, specifically affecting versions up to and including Jboss 4.X. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of deserialization processes, where the server does not adequately restrict the classes for which it performs deserialization. This oversight allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted serialized data, thereby gaining unauthorized access and control over the affected system.",
