    "desc": "CVE-2024-7314 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the anji-plus AJ-Report application. This critical flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to append \";swagger-ui\" to HTTP requests, bypassing authentication mechanisms. As a result, the attacker can execute arbitrary Java code on the victim server, potentially gaining full control over the affected system. The vulnerability is characterized by its network attack vector, low attack complexity, and does not require any privileges or user interaction, making it highly severe with a CVSS score of 9.8. This vulnerability is associated with CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges).",
