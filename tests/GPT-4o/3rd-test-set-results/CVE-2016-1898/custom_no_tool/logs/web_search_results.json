    "desc": "CVE-2016-1898 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg, a multimedia framework used for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. This vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions 2.6.6 and earlier. The issue arises from improper validation of input data in the FFmpeg library, which can lead to a denial of service condition or potentially allow for remote code execution. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This is due to FFmpeg's handling of certain file types, such as specially crafted media files, which can be exploited by a remote attacker. The vulnerability can be triggered when a user opens a malicious file using an application that relies on FFmpeg for media handling. Additionally, the subfile protocol within an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file can be exploited to perform cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or allow attackers to make requests from the server to internal systems. The issue was addressed in later updates of the FFmpeg software, and users are advised to upgrade to a version where the vulnerability has been patched, such as FFmpeg 2.8.5, to mitigate security risks associated with this vulnerability.",
