    "desc": "CVE-2018-19475 is a critical vulnerability in Ghostscript, an interpreter for PostScript and PDF files. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary shell command execution even when Ghostscript is operating in its SAFER mode, which is supposed to restrict such actions. The issue arises due to the improper handling of the %pipe% syntax, which can execute shell commands. In SAFER mode, %pipe% should be disabled, but the vulnerability exploits a flaw in the LockSafetyParams setting. By triggering a stack overflow during a restore operation, an attacker can leave the PostScript device in an inconsistent state with LockSafetyParams set to false, allowing command execution. This vulnerability affects Ghostscript versions prior to 9.26 and is considered high severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8. It can be exploited locally with low attack complexity and requires user interaction. The vulnerability was patched in version 9.26, released on November 20, 2018.",
