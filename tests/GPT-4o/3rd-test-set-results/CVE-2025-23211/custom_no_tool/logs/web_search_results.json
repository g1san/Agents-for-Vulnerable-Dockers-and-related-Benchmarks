{
    "desc": "CVE-2025-23211 is a critical Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in Tandoor Recipes, an open-source meal planning application. This vulnerability affects versions up to 1.5.23 and is due to improper handling of user-supplied input within Jinja2 templates, specifically in the file `recipes/cookbook/helper/template_helper.py`. It allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary system commands by injecting malicious Jinja2 expressions into recipe instructions. In Docker environments where the application runs with root privileges, this can lead to a full system compromise. The severity of the vulnerability is underscored by a CVSS score of 10.0, reflecting its ease of exploitation, lack of required privileges, and significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.5.24.",
