{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-17518 is a security vulnerability in Apache Flink, a framework for stream-processing and batch-processing. The vulnerability is found in the RESTful API, particularly in the `FileUploadHandler.java` class, which allows for directory traversal. This vulnerability enables attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system by exploiting the lack of proper sanitization of the filename parameter in HTTP requests. This issue affects Apache Flink versions from 1.5.1 up to 1.11.2 and was fixed in version 1.11.3. Exploitation can be achieved by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /jars/upload endpoint, potentially leading to remote code execution by overwriting existing files or uploading malicious files.",
