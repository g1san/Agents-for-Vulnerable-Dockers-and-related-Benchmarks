{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-35042 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability found in Django, a popular Python-based web framework. This vulnerability is specifically related to the improper handling of the `QuerySet.order_by()` method, where unsanitized input can be passed through the `order_by` parameter. This flaw allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access. The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `order` parameter in a vulnerable endpoint, enabling attackers to execute additional SQL commands, such as extracting sensitive information from the database. The issue affects Django versions 3.1.x before 3.1.13 and 3.2.x before 3.2.5, and it has been addressed in Django versions 3.1.13 and 3.2.5. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-89, which pertains to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. It can be exploited over a network with low complexity and does not require any privileges or user interaction.",
