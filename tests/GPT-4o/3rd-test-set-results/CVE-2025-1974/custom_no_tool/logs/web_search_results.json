    "desc": "CVE-2025-1974, also known as \"IngressNightmare,\" is a critical security vulnerability in the Ingress NGINX Controller for Kubernetes. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers with access to the pod network to execute arbitrary code within the context of the ingress-nginx controller. The issue arises from the Validating Admission Controller feature, which processes incoming ingress objects and constructs NGINX configurations. Attackers can exploit configuration injection vulnerabilities to inject arbitrary NGINX configurations through malicious ingress objects. This can lead to the disclosure of all Secrets accessible to the controller, potentially resulting in a complete cluster takeover. The vulnerability affects ingress-nginx versions earlier than v1.11.0, between v1.11.0 and v1.11.4, and v1.12.0. It has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8, indicating its critical severity. Remediation involves upgrading to ingress-nginx v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or later, or disabling the Validating Admission Controller feature.",
