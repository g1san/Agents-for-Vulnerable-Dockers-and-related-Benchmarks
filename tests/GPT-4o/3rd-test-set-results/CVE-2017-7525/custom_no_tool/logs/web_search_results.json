{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-7525 is a critical security vulnerability found in the jackson-databind library, which is a popular Java library used for processing JSON data. The vulnerability arises from a deserialization flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This flaw is present in jackson-databind versions before 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1, and 2.8.9. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper class, which is commonly used for converting JSON strings into Java objects. If the input is crafted in a specific way, it can lead to the execution of code specified by the attacker, thus compromising the security of the application using this library.",
