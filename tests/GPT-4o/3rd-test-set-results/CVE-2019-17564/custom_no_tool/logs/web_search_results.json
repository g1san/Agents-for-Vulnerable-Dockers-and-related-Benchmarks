{
    "desc": "CVE-2019-17564 is a vulnerability in Apache Dubbo, a Java-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. The issue arises due to unsafe deserialization of untrusted data when HTTP remoting is enabled. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specially crafted POST request containing a Java object to the Dubbo Provider instance, potentially leading to remote code execution. The affected versions include Apache Dubbo 2.7.0 to 2.7.4.1, 2.6.0 to 2.6.7, and all 2.5.x versions. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-502, which involves deserialization of untrusted data without sufficient validation. The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to version 2.7.5 or later or to disable the HTTP protocol in favor of other supported protocols.",
