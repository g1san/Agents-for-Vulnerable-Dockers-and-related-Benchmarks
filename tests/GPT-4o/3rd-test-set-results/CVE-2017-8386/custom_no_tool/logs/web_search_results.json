    "desc": "CVE-2017-8386 is a vulnerability in the git-shell, a restricted shell designed to limit users to executing only specific Git commands over SSH. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass these restrictions by exploiting the 'less' command used when viewing Git command help pages. By forcing SSH to allocate a pseudo-terminal (pty) using the '-t' option, an attacker can activate 'less' in interactive mode. This enables the execution of arbitrary shell commands, reading files, and other actions typically restricted by git-shell. The vulnerability affects systems where git-shell is used as a login shell, but can be mitigated by using SSH forced commands with options like 'no-pty' to prevent pty allocation. The issue was reported on April 25, 2017, and fixed versions were released on May 10, 2017. The vulnerability affects versions before 2.4.12, 2.5.6, 2.6.7, 2.7.5, 2.8.5, 2.9.4, 2.10.3, 2.11.2, and 2.12.3.",
