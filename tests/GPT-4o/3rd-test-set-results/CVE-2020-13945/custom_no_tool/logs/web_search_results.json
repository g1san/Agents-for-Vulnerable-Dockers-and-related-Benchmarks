    "desc": "CVE-2020-13945 is a critical security vulnerability affecting Apache APISIX, an open-source, high-performance API gateway. The vulnerability exists in versions 1.2 to 1.5 and also affects versions 2.2, 2.6, 2.11.0, and 2.12.1. It occurs when the Admin API is enabled, and IP restriction rules are deleted, allowing unauthorized access through a default token. This default token (edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1) permits attackers to interact with the server as an administrator, potentially leading to a server takeover. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary Lua scripts via the script parameter, enabling remote code execution (RCE). Mitigation involves configuring IP restrictions, changing the default token, and ensuring secure configurations. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-259 and has a significant CVSS score, indicating its severity.",
