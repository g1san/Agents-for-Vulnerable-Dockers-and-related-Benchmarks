{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-18349 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Fastjson, a Java library used for JSON parsing. This vulnerability affects Fastjson versions 1.2.24 and earlier. It arises from the unsafe handling of deserialized data, which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The exploit involves crafting a malicious JSON payload that leverages the \"@type\" attribute to specify a malicious class, such as `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl`, which performs a JNDI lookup to a remote RMI server. This server returns a reference to a malicious class file, which is executed on the target system. The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable Fastjson library processes the malicious JSON payload, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability is critical as it allows attackers to execute code remotely, potentially compromising the entire system.",
