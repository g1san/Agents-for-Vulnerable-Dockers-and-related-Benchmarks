    "desc": "CVE-2017-12636 is a critical vulnerability that affects both Apache Solr and Apache CouchDB, allowing for remote code execution. In Apache Solr, the vulnerability arises from a weakness in the DataImportHandler, which does not properly restrict access to its configuration and functionality. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted requests. In Apache CouchDB, the vulnerability is due to the ability of administrative users to configure the database server through HTTP(S), including setting paths for OS-level binaries that CouchDB subsequently launches. This can enable a CouchDB admin user to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user. Proper configuration and security measures, such as upgrading to secure versions, are necessary to mitigate this vulnerability.",
