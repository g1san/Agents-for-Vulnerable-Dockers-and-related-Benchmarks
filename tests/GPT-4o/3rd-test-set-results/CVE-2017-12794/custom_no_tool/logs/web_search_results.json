    "desc": "CVE-2017-12794 is a medium-severity vulnerability affecting the Django framework, specifically in the debug page. This vulnerability allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The vulnerability is present in the traceback section of the technical 500 debug page, where unescaped exception causes could be output directly. This occurs when a database-related exception, such as an IntegrityError, is raised and the exception's cause is exposed in the debug output. The vulnerability affects Django versions 1.11.4 and 1.10.7, and it was addressed in subsequent security releases. The issue is primarily relevant in development environments where the DEBUG setting is enabled, as this setting is not recommended for production environments.",
