    "desc": "CVE-2023-26031 is a critical vulnerability affecting Apache Hadoop versions 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 on Linux systems. This vulnerability is associated with the \"container-executor\" binary, which is used for launching YARN Secure Containers. The issue allows local users to gain root privileges through relative library resolution due to a patch (YARN-10495) that altered the library loading path. This enables users with limited privileges to install and execute a malicious libcrypto library as root. In environments where a YARN cluster accepts jobs from remote (authenticated) users, these users might also exploit the vulnerability to gain root access. The vulnerability is mitigated in version 3.3.5 by reverting the patch with YARN-11441. A vulnerable setup can be identified by checking the RUNPATH or RPATH of the container-executor binary, where a vulnerable setup has the suid bit set and is owned by root.",
