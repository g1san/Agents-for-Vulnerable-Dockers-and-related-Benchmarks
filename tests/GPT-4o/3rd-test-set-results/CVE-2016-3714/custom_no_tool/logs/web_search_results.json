{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-3714, also known as \"ImageTragick,\" is a critical vulnerability in the ImageMagick software suite, which is used for image processing. This vulnerability affects several coders in ImageMagick, including EPHEMERAL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN, and PLT, in versions before 6.9.3-10 and 7.x before 7.0.1-1. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server by embedding shell metacharacters within a crafted image file. When the image is processed by ImageMagick, these metacharacters can trigger unintended shell commands, potentially allowing attackers to gain control of the server.",
