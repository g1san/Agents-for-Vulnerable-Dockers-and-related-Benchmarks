    "desc": "CVE-2020-14144 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting Gitea versions 1.1.0 to 1.12.5. This vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute remote code using git hooks. It arises from improper neutralization of special elements in operating system commands, classified under CWE-78. The exploitation requires a user with valid credentials and the \"May create git hooks\" rights. By creating a repository on the Gitea web interface and adding a shell script to the Post Receive Hook, an attacker can execute the script after a new commit is received. This potentially provides a reverse shell to the attacker, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability significantly. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2, indicating a high level of severity. It has been patched in version 1.12.6, and mitigation involves updating to at least version 1.13.0 or disabling git hook creation by default through the DISABLEGITHOOKS configuration setting.",
