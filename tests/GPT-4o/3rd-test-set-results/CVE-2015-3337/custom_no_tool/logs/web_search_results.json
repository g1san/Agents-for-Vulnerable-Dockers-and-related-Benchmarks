    "desc": "CVE-2015-3337 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch, a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. This vulnerability occurs in Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.4.5 and 1.5.2, specifically when a plugin with the \"site\" functionality is installed. This vulnerability allows attackers to send specially crafted URLs to the Elasticsearch server, enabling them to traverse directories and access arbitrary files outside the intended directory. For instance, an attacker could access the contents of sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`. This issue arises due to improper validation of file paths, allowing directory traversal sequences like \"../\" to be used. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely and can lead to unauthorized file access, posing significant security risks.",
