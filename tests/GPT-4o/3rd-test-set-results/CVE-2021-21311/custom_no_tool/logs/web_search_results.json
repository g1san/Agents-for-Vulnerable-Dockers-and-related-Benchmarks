{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-21311 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in Adminer, an open-source database management tool encapsulated in a single PHP file. This vulnerability affects Adminer versions from 4.0.0 up to, but not including, 4.7.9, specifically impacting users of Adminer versions that bundle all drivers (e.g., adminer.php). The vulnerability allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from the server where Adminer is hosted, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources. The issue was resolved in version 4.7.9. The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 7.2, indicating a high severity. Exploitation involves interacting with internal services, such as an HTTP server, to retrieve sensitive data. This vulnerability can be particularly dangerous in cloud environments, where it might be used to access metadata services and extract credentials for lateral movement within the cloud infrastructure.",
