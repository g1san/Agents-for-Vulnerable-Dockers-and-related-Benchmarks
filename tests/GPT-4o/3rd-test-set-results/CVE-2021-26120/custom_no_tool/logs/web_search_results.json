    "desc": "CVE-2021-26120 is a critical Arbitrary Code Injection vulnerability in the Smarty PHP Template Engine, affecting versions prior to 3.1.39. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting improper filtering of template function names during syntax compilation. This is achieved by injecting a crafted function name containing malicious code, such as `rce(){};system(\"id\");function`, which can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without requiring user interaction or special access conditions, resulting in a total compromise of the affected system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Users are advised to upgrade to Smarty version 3.1.39 or higher to mitigate this risk.",
