    "desc": "CVE-2018-15685 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Electron framework. This vulnerability is present in Electron versions 3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15. The issue arises when applications using Electron can open nested child windows. Despite setting \"nodeIntegration\" to false, which should prevent web content from accessing Node.js features, a payload can still access Node bindings due to improper inheritance of window properties through nested windows and iframes. This leads to a fallback on insecure default settings, allowing for unauthorized code execution. The vulnerability is particularly concerning for applications that allow remote user content or have cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. It can also be exploited if applications open windows with \"nativeWindowOpen: true\" or \"sandbox: true\" options. The Electron team has addressed this issue in later versions, and mitigation involves following Electron's security guidelines, updating to patched versions, and ensuring secure webPreferences configurations.",
