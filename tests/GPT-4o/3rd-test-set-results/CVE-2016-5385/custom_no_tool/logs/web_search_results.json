    "desc": "CVE-2016-5385, widely known as the \"httpoxy\" vulnerability, affects applications running in CGI or CGI-like environments. The vulnerability arises from a namespace conflict where the HTTP Proxy header from a request is placed into environment variables as HTTP_PROXY. This variable is commonly used to configure outgoing proxies, leading to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by sending a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, which can redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server. This vulnerability has a high severity CVSS score of 8.1, indicating significant potential impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It affects several languages and CGI implementations, including PHP (through version 7.0.8), Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, HHVM, and Python. To mitigate the vulnerability, it is recommended to block Proxy request headers before they reach the application or upgrade to a non-vulnerable version.",
