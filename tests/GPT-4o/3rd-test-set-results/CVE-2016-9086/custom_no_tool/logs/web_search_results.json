{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-9086 is a critical security vulnerability affecting GitLab, an open-source platform for managing Git repositories. This vulnerability is present in GitLab CE/EE versions 8.9 to 8.13.2 and arises from the improper handling of symbolic links in the \"import/export project\" feature introduced in version 8.9. This feature allows users to export and re-import projects as tar files. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to exploit symbolic links in compressed project files to read arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, such as \"/etc/passwd,\" and the potential leakage of authentication tokens, granting attackers administrative access to all GitLab projects. The issue was mitigated by removing symlinks from import packages and redirecting error outputs to logs instead of the front end.",
