    "desc": "CVE-2021-41460 is a high-severity SQL injection vulnerability found in ECShop version 4.1.0, an open-source e-commerce platform. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data. The vulnerability arises from improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands, which enables attackers to craft specific SQL queries that bypass input validation checks. This can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored in the application's database. The attack vector is network-based with low complexity, requiring no privileges or user interaction. The CVSSv3 score for this vulnerability is 7.5, indicating its high severity.",
