{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-17519 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Apache Flink's REST API, affecting versions 1.11.0 to 1.11.2. This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the local filesystem of the JobManager by sending crafted requests to the REST API. The flaw is due to improper handling of file paths in the JobManagerCustomLogHandler.java class, allowing direct file path access. Exploiting this vulnerability requires network access to the REST API endpoint, enabling unauthorized users to potentially access sensitive files and submit jobs, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The issue has a high severity score of 7.5 and was fixed in version 1.11.3 by restricting file path access.",
