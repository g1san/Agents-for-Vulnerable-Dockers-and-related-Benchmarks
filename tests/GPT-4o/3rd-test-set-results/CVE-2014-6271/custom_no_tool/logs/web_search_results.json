    "desc": "CVE-2014-6271, commonly known as Shellshock, is a critical vulnerability in the Bash shell, a widely used command-line interface on Unix-based systems. The flaw arises because Bash improperly processes trailing strings after function definitions in environment variable values. This improper handling allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target system. The vulnerability can be remotely exploited through various services and applications that use Bash to handle environment variables, notably web servers using CGI scripts. An attacker can craft a specially formatted environment variable and pass it through a vulnerable service that invokes Bash, leading to unauthorized access and control over affected systems. The impact is significant, necessitating prompt application of patches and updates to mitigate the risk. Initial patches were found to be inadequate, requiring further advisories to fully address the issue.",
