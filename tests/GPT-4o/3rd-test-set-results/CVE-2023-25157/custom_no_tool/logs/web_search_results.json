    "desc": "CVE-2023-25157 is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in GeoServer, an open-source server for sharing geospatial data. The vulnerability arises when malicious payloads are injected into the CQL_FILTER parameter via HTTP requests. This can be exploited through URLs containing the path '/geoserver/ows?service=wfs'. The vulnerability is associated with the use of OGC Filter and Function expressions, particularly when certain filters and functions like PropertyIsLike, strEndsWith, strStartsWith, FeatureId, jsonArrayContains, and DWithin are used with specific datastore configurations such as PostGIS and Oracle. Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, and service disruption. Affected versions include GeoServer <2.21.4 and <2.22.2, and GeoTools <28.2, <27.4, <26.7, <25.7, <24.7. Mitigation involves upgrading to patched versions or disabling certain database features.",
