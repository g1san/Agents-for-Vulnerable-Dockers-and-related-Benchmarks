    "desc": "CVE-2019-9053 is a critical vulnerability in CMS Made Simple versions up to 2.2.9, specifically within the News module. This vulnerability allows for unauthenticated blind time-based SQL injection. The flaw is exploited through the 'idlist' parameter, where attackers can inject malicious SQL code by sending a negative number followed by a comma and a payload, effectively bypassing input filters. This vulnerability permits attackers to extract sensitive information such as admin credentials from the database by monitoring response delays. The exploit is critical as it can lead to remote code execution without prior authentication, posing significant security risks to affected systems.",
