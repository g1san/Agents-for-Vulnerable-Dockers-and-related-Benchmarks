    "desc": "CVE-2024-1561 is a vulnerability found in the Gradio application, specifically affecting versions 3.47 to 4.12. This vulnerability is due to an input validation flaw in the `/component_server` endpoint, which allows attackers to invoke any method on a Component class using attacker-controlled arguments. By exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the Block class, attackers can copy files from the filesystem to a temporary directory and access them, leading to unauthorized local file read access. This flaw poses a significant risk when the application is exposed to the internet with `launch(share=True)`, as it allows remote attackers to read files on the host machine. The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-29 (Path Traversal) and has a CVSS score of 7.5. It was patched in Gradio version 4.13.0. The vulnerability also affects Gradio apps hosted on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, potentially exposing sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.",
