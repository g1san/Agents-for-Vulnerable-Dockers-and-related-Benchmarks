    "desc": "CVE-2024-36401 is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting GeoServer, an open-source server designed for sharing and editing geospatial data. The vulnerability is present in GeoServer versions prior to 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2. It arises from the unsafe evaluation of property names as XPath expressions within the GeoTools library API, which is utilized by GeoServer. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely by exploiting OGC request parameters such as WFS GetFeature, WFS GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, WMS GetLegendGraphic, and WPS Execute requests. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it has been actively exploited, leading to malware distribution and botnet activities. The GeoServer community has released patches to address this issue, and users are strongly urged to upgrade to the latest versions or apply necessary patches. The vulnerability has significant implications for sectors relying on geospatial data, including government agencies.",
