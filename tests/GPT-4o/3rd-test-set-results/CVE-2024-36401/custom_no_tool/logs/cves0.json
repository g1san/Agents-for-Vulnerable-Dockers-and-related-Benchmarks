The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding it on an insecure host should not be okay.",

      "description": "GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.",

      "description": "GeoServer's Server Status page and REST API (at `/geoserver/rest/about/status`) lists *all* environment variables and Java properties to *any* GeoServer user with administrative rights as part of those modules' status message.\n\nThese variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens, for example:\n\n* Data stores defined with [parameterized catalog settings][catalog] (`-DALLOW_ENV_PARAMETRIZATION=true`) which need a password or access key.\n\n* GeoServer's official Docker image [uses environment variables to configure PostgreSQL JNDI resources, including credentials][docker-jndi] (`POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_USERNAME`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`)\n\nAdditionally, many community-developed GeoServer container images `export` other credentials from their start-up scripts as environment variables to the GeoServer (`java`) process, such as:\n\n* GeoServer `admin` and master (`root`) passwords\n\n* Tomcat management application password\n\n* HTTPS/TLS certificate key store password\n\n* AWS S3 bucket access keys\n\nThe precise scope of the issue depends on which container image is used and how it is configured.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Some container images allow passing secrets as files (eg: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE`), or randomly generating passwords on start-up. While this is promoted as best-practice[^secret-files], if its start-up script [`export`s these as environment variables][bash-export] to GeoServer, they are **also** impacted by this issue.\n\n[bash-export]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#index-export\n[catalog]: https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/datadirectory/configtemplate.html\n[docker-jndi]: https://github.com/geoserver/docker/blob/master/README.md#how-to-enable-a-postgresql-jndi-resource\n\n### Impact\n\nThe “about status” API endpoint (at `/geoserver/rest/about/status`) which powers the Server Status page is only available to administrators.\n\nDepending on the operating environment, administrators might have legitimate access to credentials in other ways, but this issue defeats more sophisticated controls (like break-glass access to secrets or role accounts).\n\nBy default, GeoServer only allows same-origin authenticated API access. This limits the scope for a third-party attacker to use an administrator’s credentials to gain access to credentials (ie: requires XSS).\n\nWe were unable to determine any other conditions under which the GeoServer REST API may be available more broadly.\n\n### Fixes / remediation\n\nGeoServer 2.24.4 and 2.25.1 hide **all** environment variables and Java system properties *by default*, with *no further action required by GeoServer administrators*.\n\n[There are new settings to allow an administrator to display these again][showing] – effectively **reverting** this security fix. We strongly recommend administrators leave these settings as-is, and use alternative mechanisms to access environment variables (instructions below).\n\nIf you're using GeoServer in a container runtime (such as Docker or Kubernetes) or from some other distributor's packages, you'll need to wait for the maintainer to update the version of GeoServer used in their image.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> If you run GeoServer with [parameterized catalog settings][catalog] (`-DALLOW_ENV_PARAMETRIZATION=true`), a GeoServer administrator could use this to access any environment variable or Java property by including it in some field which is rendered by the UI (such as the description field), **even with this fix**.\n\n[showing]: https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/config.html#showing-environment-variables-and-java-system-properties\n\n### Advice for container / Docker image maintainers\n\nUpdate container images to use GeoServer 2.24.4 or 2.25.1 to get the bug fix.\n\nPlease leave environment variables and Java system properties hidden by default. If you provide the option to re-enable it, [communicate the impact and risks][showing] so that users can make an informed choice.\n\nContainer images should practice \"defence in depth\", to limit the impact when it is configured to show environment variables and/or properties:\n\n* Pass secrets to the container as either:\n\n  * files which are only readable by the GeoServer process/UID, or,\n  * references (identifiers) to a secret stored in a cloud provider's metadata or secret management service\n\n* Pass secrets to GeoServer by generating configuration files as part of your start-up scripts, rather than passing variables/properties or relying on [parameterized catalog settings][catalog].\n\n* Ensure any configuration files with secrets are not readable by other users.\n\n* Clear all environment variables which contain secrets _before_ starting GeoServer.\n\n  _Alternatively:_ start up GeoServer with *only* the environment variables it needs, and no secrets.\n\n* **Don't** pass secrets as command-line flags – these are shown in `ps` to all users!\n\n### Alternatives for displaying GeoServer's environment variables\n\n* **On Linux,** you can get all environment variables [set at _start-up time_][linux-environ] for a running process with:\n\n  ```sh\n  tr '\\0' '\\n' < /proc/${GEOSERVER_PID}/environ\n  ```\n\n* **On Windows,** [SysInternals' Process Explorer][proc-exp] can show running processes' environment variables.\n\n* Current versions of **macOS** do not allow arbitrary access to other running processes' environment variables. Disabling these restrictions (on a macOS level) would significantly reduce the overall security of the system.\n\n[linux-environ]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/70636\n[proc-exp]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer\n\n[^secret-files]: [Docker Compose: How to use secrets in Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/use-secrets/), [Docker Swarm: Build support for Docker Secrets into your images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/#build-support-for-docker-secrets-into-your-images)",

      "description": "Bouncy Castle provides the `X509LDAPCertStoreSpi.java` class which can be used in conjunction with the CertPath API for validating certificate paths. Pre-1.73 the implementation did not check the X.500 name of any certificate, subject, or issuer being passed in for LDAP wild cards, meaning the presence of a wild car may lead to Information Disclosure.\n\nA potential attack would be to generate a self-signed certificate with a subject name that contains special characters, e.g: `CN=Subject*)(objectclass=`. This will be included into the filter and provides the attacker ability to specify additional attributes in the search query. This can be exploited as a blind LDAP injection: an attacker can enumerate valid attribute values using the boolean blind injection technique. The exploitation depends on the structure of the target LDAP directory, as well as what kind of errors are exposed to the user.\n\nChanges to the `X509LDAPCertStoreSpi.java` class add the additional checking of any X.500 name used to correctly escape wild card characters.",

By repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the server's memory finally.\n\n\nVulnerability details\nThe Jetty DoSFilter (Denial of Service Filter) is a security filter designed to protect web applications against certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behavior. It helps to mitigate excessive resource consumption by limiting the rate at which clients can make requests to the server.  The DoSFilter monitors and tracks client request patterns, including request rates, and can take actions such as blocking or delaying requests from clients that exceed predefined thresholds.  The internal tracking of requests in DoSFilter is the source of this OutOfMemory condition.\n\n\nImpact\nUsers of the DoSFilter may be subject to DoS attacks that will ultimately exhaust the memory of the server if they have not configured session passivation or an aggressive session inactivation timeout.\n\n\nPatches\nThe DoSFilter has been patched in all active releases to no longer support the session tracking mode, even if configured.\n\n\nPatched releases:\n\n  *  9.4.54\n  *  10.0.18\n  *  11.0.18\n  *  12.0.3",

      "description": "## Summary\n\nEclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.\n\n## Details\n\n### Affected components\n\nThe vulnerable component is the `HttpURI` class when used as a utility class in an application.  The Jetty usage of the class is not vulnerable.\n\n### Attack overview\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does not well validate the authority section of a URI. When presented with an illegal authority that may contain user info (eg username:password#@hostname:port), then the parsing of the URI is not failed.  Moreover, the interpretation of what part of the authority is the host name differs from a common browser in  that they also do not fail, but they select a different host name from the illegal URI.\n\n### Attack scenario\n\nA typical attack scenario is illustrated in the diagram below. The Validator checks whether the attacker-supplied URL is on the blocklist. If not, the URI is passed to the Requester for redirection. The Requester is responsible for sending requests to the hostname specified by the URI.\n\nThis attack occurs when the Validator is the `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI` class and the Requester is the `Browser` (include chrome, firefox and Safari). An attacker can send a malformed URI to the Validator (e.g., `http://browser.check%23%40vulndetector.com/` ). After validation, the Validator finds that the hostname is not on the blocklist. However, the Requester can still send requests to the domain with the hostname `vulndetector.com`.\n\n## PoC\n\npayloads:\n\n```\nhttp://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://vulndetector.com\\\\/\n```\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTML tag scenarios. Below is a poc example. After clicking the button, the browser will open \"browser.check\", and jetty will parse this URL as \"vulndetector.com\".\n\n```\n<a href=\"http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\"></a>\n```\nA comparison of the parsing differences between Jetty and chrome is shown in the table below (note that neither should accept the URI as valid).\n\n| Invalid URI                                       | Jetty            | Chrome        |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTTP 302 Location\n\n| Input                    | Jetty          | Chrome        |\n| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check%5c/ | browser.check\\ | browser.check |\n\nIt is noteworthy that Spring Web also faced similar security vulnerabilities, being affected by the aforementioned four types of payloads. These issues have since been resolved and have been assigned three CVE numbers [3-5].\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is limited to developers that use the Jetty HttpURI directly.  Example: your project implemented a blocklist to block on some hosts based on HttpURI's handling of authority section.  The vulnerability will help attackers bypass the protections that developers have set up for hosts. The vulnerability will lead to **SSRF**[1] and **URL Redirection**[2] vulnerabilities in several cases. \n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe attacks outlined above rely on decoded user data being passed to the `HttpURI` class. Application should not pass decoded user data as an encoded URI to any URI class/method, including `HttpURI`.  Such applications are likely to be vulnerable in other ways. \nThe immediate solution is to upgrade to a version of the class that will fully validate the characters of the URI authority.  Ultimately, Jetty will deprecate and remove support for user info in the authority per [RFC9110 Section 4.2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-4.2.4). \n\nNote that the Chrome (and other browsers) parse the invalid user info section improperly as well (due to flawed WhatWG URL parsing rules that do not apply outside of a Web Browser).\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html\n[2] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html",

Adding this block right before the end:\n\n   ```xml\n      <security-constraint>\n           <web-resource-collection>\n               <web-resource-name>BlockDemoRequests</web-resource-name>\n               <url-pattern>/TestWfsPost/*</url-pattern>\n           </web-resource-collection>\n           <auth-constraint>\n               <role-name>BLOCKED</role-name>\n           </auth-constraint>\n       </security-constraint>\n   ```\n\n### Resolution\n\nUpgrading to GeoServer 2.24.4, or 2.25.2, removes the ``TestWfsPost`` servlet resolving this issue.\n\nThe demo request page functionality is now implemented directly in the browser.\n\n### Reference\n\n- https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11794\n- https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11390\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40822",

This allows for Out-of-Band (OOB) data exfiltration of local files accessible by the GeoServer process, and Service Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\n## Details\n\nWhile direct entity resolution is managed by application property ENTITY_RESOLUTION_ALLOWLIST for XML Parsing, this restriction was not being used by the GeoTools library when building an in-memory XSD Library Schema representation.\n\nThis bypasses GeoServer's AllowListEntityResolver enabling XXE attacks.\n\n## PoC\n\nNo public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable through WFS service.\n\n## Impact\n\n* Information Disclosure: \n\n  This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that are accessible to the GeoServer process.\n  \n  This can lead to exposure of sensitive information including configuration files, credentials, and system files. The attack can be performed remotely without authentication, making it particularly severe.\n\n* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) \n  \n  The mechanism inherently allows forcing GeoServer to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs, enabling SSRF attacks against internal network resources \n\n## References\n\n* [CVE-2025-30220](https://github.com/geotools/geotools/security/advisories/GHSA-826p-4gcg-35vw) XML External Entity (XXE) Processing Vulnerability in XSD schema handling\n* [External Entities Resolution](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/config.html#production-config-external-entities) (GeoServer User Manual)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was initially reported via an automated tool described below.

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

      "description": "### Summary\n\nGeoTools Schema class use of Eclipse XSD library to represent schema data structure is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) exploit.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis impacts whoever exposes XML processing with ``gt-xsd-core`` involved in parsing, when the documents carry a reference to an external XML schema. The ``gt-xsd-core`` Schemas class is not using the EntityResolver provided by the ParserHandler (if any was configured).\n\nThis also impacts users of ``gt-wfs-ng`` DataStore where the ENTITY_RESOLVER connection parameter was not being used as intended.\n\n### Resolution\n\nGeoTools API change allows EntityResolver to be supplied to the following methods:\n\n```java\nSchemas.parse( location, locators, resolvers, uriHandlers, entityResolver);\nSchemas.findSchemas(Configuration configuration, EntityResolver entityResolver);\n```\n\nWith this API change the `gt-wfs-ng` WFS DataStore ENTITY_RESOLVER parameter is now used.\n\n### Reference\n\n* [GHSA-jj54-8f66-c5pc](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-jj54-8f66-c5pc): Describes the impact of the ``gt-xsd-core`` vulnerability on the GeoServer WFS protocol, resulting in both Service Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Out-of-Band (OOB) data exfiltration of local files.\n\n* [GHSA-2p76-gc46-5fvc](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-2p76-gc46-5fvc): Describes the impact of the ``gt-wfs-ng`` and ``gt-xsd-core`` vulnerability on the GeoNetwork WFS Index functionality.",
