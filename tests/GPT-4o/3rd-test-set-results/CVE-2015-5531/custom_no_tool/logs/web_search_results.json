{
    "desc": "CVE-2015-5531 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files that the Elasticsearch JVM process can access. The flaw is related to the Snapshot API, where attackers can exploit the API calls to perform directory traversal attacks. This type of attack can expose sensitive files and information stored on the server. The vulnerability has been resolved in Elasticsearch versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0. To mitigate this issue, users can upgrade to these versions or use a firewall, reverse proxy, or Shield to block untrusted snapshot API calls.",
