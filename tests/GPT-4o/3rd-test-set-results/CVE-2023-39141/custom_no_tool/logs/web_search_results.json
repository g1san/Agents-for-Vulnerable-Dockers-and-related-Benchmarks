{
    "desc": "CVE-2023-39141 is a path traversal vulnerability found in the webui-aria2 project, specifically in the `node-server.js` file. This vulnerability arises because the code accepts file names from URL input without properly sanitizing them, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended directory. By sending crafted requests, such as using the curl command, an attacker can read any file that the web server user can access, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`. This vulnerability affects all versions of webui-aria2, including the latest commit identified as '109903f0e2774cf948698cd95a01f77f33d7dd2c'. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network without requiring any user interaction or privileges. It has a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating a high severity due to the potential total loss of confidentiality, although there is no impact on integrity or availability. As of now, there is no fixed version available for webui-aria2 to address this issue.",
