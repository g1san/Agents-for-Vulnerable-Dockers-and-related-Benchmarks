    "desc": "CVE-2022-26134 is a critical vulnerability in Atlassian's Confluence Server and Data Center that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability is due to an OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection flaw that can be exploited by placing a malicious OGNL payload in the URI of an HTTP request. This vulnerability affects all versions of Confluence Server and Data Center prior to the fixed versions released by Atlassian. The issue was actively exploited in the wild as a zero-day vulnerability, and it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected Confluence instances without authentication. Atlassian released fixed versions and mitigation steps to address this vulnerability.",
