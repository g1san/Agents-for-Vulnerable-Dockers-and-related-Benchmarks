    "desc": "CVE-2021-45232 is a critical vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard, specifically affecting versions from 2.7 to 2.10. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access due to improper access controls, enabling attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms. The flaw arises because some APIs use the gin framework directly instead of the droplet framework's authentication middleware. This weakness can be exploited to execute arbitrary Lua scripts, leading to remote code execution (RCE). Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive interfaces, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), malicious traffic proxies, and unauthorized configuration changes. Users are advised to update to version 2.10.1 or later to mitigate these risks.",
