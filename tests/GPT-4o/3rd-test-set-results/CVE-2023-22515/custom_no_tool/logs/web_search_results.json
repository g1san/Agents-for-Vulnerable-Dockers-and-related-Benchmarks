    "desc": "CVE-2023-22515 is a critical broken access control vulnerability affecting Confluence Data Center and Server versions 8.0.0 to 8.5.1. This vulnerability allows external attackers to exploit publicly accessible instances to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts and access instances. The severity is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 10. This issue is remotely exploitable and requires JavaScript to be enabled. The vulnerability does not impact versions prior to 8.0.0 or Atlassian Cloud sites. Immediate upgrading to fixed versions 8.3.3, 8.4.3, or 8.5.2 or later is recommended. If upgrading is not possible, interim measures include blocking access to certain endpoints. Successful exploitation can lead to full administrative access, potentially resulting in data exfiltration and malicious plugin installation. The vulnerability is unauthenticated and trivially exploitable, posing a high risk to publicly accessible instances.",
