    "desc": "CVE-2017-1000353 is a vulnerability found in Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier, as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier. The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting the Jenkins Command Line Interface (CLI). Attackers can transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object, which the system then deserializes using a new `ObjectInputStream`. This process effectively bypasses the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism that was intended to prevent such attacks. The vulnerability was addressed by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist and backporting a new HTTP CLI protocol to replace the insecure remoting-based (Java serialization) CLI protocol.",
