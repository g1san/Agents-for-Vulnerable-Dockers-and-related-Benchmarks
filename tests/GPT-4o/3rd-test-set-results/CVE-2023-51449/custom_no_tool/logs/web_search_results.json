    "desc": "CVE-2023-51449 is a path traversal vulnerability in the Gradio framework, affecting versions 4.0 to 4.10. This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files from a server hosting Gradio, including sensitive information such as environment variables. The flaw lies in the file endpoint, which fails to properly validate file paths, allowing traversal out of the designated temporary directory. This issue can be exploited to access sensitive data like secrets stored in Hugging Face Spaces. The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.0 and patched in version 4.11.0. It also allows for file traversal attacks and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), enabling attackers to access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL if they know the file paths. The attack can be executed over a network with low complexity and does not require any privileges or user interaction, making it a high-severity issue with a CVSS score of 8.6.",
