    "desc": "CVE-2015-5254 is a critical vulnerability found in Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.x prior to 5.13.0. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation, where the broker does not restrict the classes that can be serialized. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted serialized Java Message Service (JMS) ObjectMessage object to the ActiveMQ server. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that ActiveMQ listens on port 61616 for incoming connections, and if configured to accept untrusted serialized objects, it can lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited remotely without authentication, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials to execute arbitrary code. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.8, indicating a high severity level. It affects specific versions of the `org.apache.activemq:activemq-client` package, introduced in versions 5.0.0 and 5.12.0, and fixed in versions 5.11.3 and 5.12.2, respectively. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to apply security patches and configure trusted classes as outlined in the ActiveMQ documentation.",
