    "desc": "CVE-2025-4123 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in Grafana. This vulnerability arises from a combination of client path traversal and open redirect issues. Attackers can exploit this flaw to redirect users to a malicious website that hosts a frontend plugin capable of executing arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability can be exploited even without editor permissions if anonymous access is enabled. Furthermore, if the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, the open redirect can be utilized to perform a full read Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). However, the default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana helps mitigate the XSS risk via the `connect-src` directive.",
