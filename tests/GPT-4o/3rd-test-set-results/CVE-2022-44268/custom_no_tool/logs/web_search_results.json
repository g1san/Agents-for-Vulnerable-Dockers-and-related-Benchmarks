    "desc": "CVE-2022-44268 is an Information Disclosure vulnerability found in ImageMagick version 7.1.0-49. This vulnerability occurs when a PNG image is parsed, for instance during a resize operation. The resulting image might unintentionally include the contents of an arbitrary file on the system, if the magick binary has the permissions required to read that file. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed through image files processed by ImageMagick.",
