    "desc": "CVE-2020-29599 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick, a popular image processing software, affecting versions before 6.9.11-40 and 7.x before 7.0.10-40. The flaw is related to the mishandling of the -authenticate option, which is used to set passwords on PDF files. Due to improper escaping or sanitization of the user-controlled password input, it is possible to inject additional shell commands via the coders/pdf.c file, potentially leading to unauthorized command execution.",
