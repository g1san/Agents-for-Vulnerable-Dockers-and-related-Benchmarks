    "desc": "CVE-2024-27348 is a Remote Command Execution vulnerability found in Apache HugeGraph-Server, a graph database server. This vulnerability affects versions from 1.0.0 up to but not including 1.3.0, when the server is running on Java8 or Java11. The issue arises due to insufficient validation of user inputs, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to upgrade to version 1.3.0 and ensure that the authentication system is enabled.",
