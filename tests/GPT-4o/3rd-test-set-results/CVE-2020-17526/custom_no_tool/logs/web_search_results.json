    "desc": "CVE-2020-17526 is a critical security vulnerability in Apache Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform. The issue stems from a default security misconfiguration where a static key, 'temporary_key,' is used to sign authentication cookies. This flaw enables attackers to bypass authentication by creating a local installation of the same Airflow version, logging in as an administrator, and replaying the session cookie to gain admin access on the target server. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute code on the server, potentially compromising cloud credentials and gaining access to the entire cloud account. This vulnerability is present in Apache Airflow Webserver versions prior to 1.10.14. The vulnerability was addressed in versions 1.10.15 and 2.0.2, which generate a random string for the authentication key. Mitigation strategies include updating to a fixed version, changing the default secret key, and securing the application with strong encryption.",
