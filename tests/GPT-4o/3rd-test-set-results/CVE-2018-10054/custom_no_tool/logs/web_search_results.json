    "desc": "CVE-2018-10054 is a vulnerability found in the H2 database version 1.4.197, which is used by Datomic before version 0.9.5697 and potentially other products. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to the CREATE ALIAS feature in H2, which can execute arbitrary Java code. This feature can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code remotely. The vendor of H2 has stated that the database is not meant to be used outside of a secure environment, which implies that the vulnerability is primarily a concern in improperly secured or exposed environments.",
