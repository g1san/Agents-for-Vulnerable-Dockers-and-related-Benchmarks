    "desc": "CVE-2023-29300 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion, a platform for rapid web application development. This vulnerability arises from the deserialization of untrusted data, specifically involving the unsafe use of the Java Reflection API in the WDDX packet deserialization process. It allows for arbitrary code execution without authentication, making it a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting a malicious WDDX packet to manipulate the deserialization process, leading to JNDI injection and potential remote code execution. The vulnerability affects Adobe ColdFusion versions 2018 (Update 16 and earlier), 2021 (Update 6 and earlier), and the 2023 GA Release. It has been actively exploited in the wild, including by state-sponsored groups, to deploy webshells for persistent access. Adobe released security updates to address this issue, but subsequent patches were needed to fully mitigate bypasses and related exploits.",
