    "desc": "CVE-2021-25646 is a critical vulnerability in Apache Druid, a high-performance analytics data store designed for real-time multi-dimensional OLAP analysis. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) due to insufficient input validation in the Druid indexer API. An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted request to the `/druid/indexer/v1/sampler` endpoint, which includes a JavaScript function within the `transformSpec` filter. This function can execute system commands using `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the server. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the lack of authentication in Druid by default, making it possible to exploit the system remotely without any credentials. This poses a significant security risk as it could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands, open reverse shells, and compromise the entire system. Apache Druid versions affected by this vulnerability are 0.20.0 and earlier. Apache has released version 0.20.1 to address this issue, and it is critical for users to update to this patched version to mitigate the risk.",
