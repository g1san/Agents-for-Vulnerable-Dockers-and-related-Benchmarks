    "desc": "CVE-2017-12149 is a critical vulnerability found in the JBoss Application Server, specifically within the Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 5.2. The issue is located in the doFilter method of the ReadOnlyAccessFilter in the HTTP Invoker. This vulnerability is due to the method failing to restrict the classes it deserializes, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. By sending crafted serialized data, an attacker can manipulate the deserialization process to execute malicious code on the server, leading to a compromise of the system.",
