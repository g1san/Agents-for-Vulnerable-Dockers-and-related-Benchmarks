    "desc": "CVE-2021-40822 is a high-severity Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in the TestWfsPost feature of GeoServer. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit GeoServer by sending specially crafted requests that can access internal systems or sensitive data. The SSRF vulnerability occurs because GeoServer allows the setting of a proxy host, enabling attackers to perform arbitrary requests to internal network resources that are otherwise inaccessible. This vulnerability affects GeoServer versions up to 2.18.5 and 2.19.x up to 2.19.2, and it has been addressed in later versions (2.25.2 and 2.24.4) by removing the TestWfsPost servlet and replacing it with a JavaScript Demo Page. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-918 and poses a significant security risk by potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive internal resources.",
