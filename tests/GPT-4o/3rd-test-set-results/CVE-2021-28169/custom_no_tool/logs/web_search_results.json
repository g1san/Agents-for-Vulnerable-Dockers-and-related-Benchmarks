    "desc": "CVE-2021-28169 is a security vulnerability found in Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.40 and earlier, 10.0.2 and earlier, and 11.0.2 and earlier. This vulnerability resides in the ConcatServlet component of Jetty, which allows attackers to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory by sending requests with a doubly encoded path. For instance, a request such as `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can be used to access the web.xml file, potentially exposing sensitive information about the web application's configuration and implementation.",
