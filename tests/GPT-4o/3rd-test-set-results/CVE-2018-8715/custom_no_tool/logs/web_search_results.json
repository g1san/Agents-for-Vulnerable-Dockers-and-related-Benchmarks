    "desc": "CVE-2018-8715 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting the Embedthis HTTP library and AppWeb versions prior to 7.0.3. The vulnerability is due to a logic flaw in the authCondition function within http/httpLib.c, which allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms for form and digest login types. This can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted HTTP request, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system and posing a significant risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.1 and is classified under CWE-287. It was published on March 15, 2018, and affects versions of AppWeb prior to 7.0.3. The recommended remediation is to upgrade to the latest version of AppWeb.",
