    "desc": "CVE-2022-41678 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, specifically involving the Jolokia interface. It is classified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data issue that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code remotely. The vulnerability arises when certain ActiveMQ configurations permit the Jetty server to handle requests to /api/jolokia, enabling the creation of JmxRequests via JSONObject. This process can lead to Remote Code Execution through various MBeans, such as jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl on Java versions above 11. Exploiting this vulnerability involves a sequence of method calls that can result in a webshell being written to a .jsp file. The vulnerability affects Apache ActiveMQ versions from 5.16.0 up to but not including 5.16.6, and from 5.17.0 up to but not including 5.17.4. Mitigation strategies include restricting actions authorized on Jolokia or disabling it entirely. Updated Jolokia configurations are available in ActiveMQ versions 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, and 6.0.0. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 and is actively exploited in the wild.",
