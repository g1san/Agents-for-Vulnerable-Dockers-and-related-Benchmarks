    "desc": "CVE-2019-20933 is a security vulnerability found in InfluxDB versions prior to 1.7.6. The flaw resides in the `authenticate` function within the `services/httpd/handler.go` file. The vulnerability is an authentication bypass issue that occurs because a JSON Web Token (JWT) may be processed with an empty SharedSecret. This weakness allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the InfluxDB instance by exploiting the improperly handled JWT, effectively bypassing authentication controls.",
