    "desc": "CVE-2017-3066 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion that involves a Java deserialization issue in the Apache BlazeDS library. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted serialized AMF payloads. The issue arises because ColdFusion does not properly validate input classes during deserialization, allowing any class in the classpath that adheres to Java Beans conventions or implements the java.io.Externalizable interface to be deserialized. This can lead to severe impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The vulnerability affects Adobe ColdFusion 2016 Update 3 and earlier, ColdFusion 11 Update 11 and earlier, and ColdFusion 10 Update 22 and earlier.",
