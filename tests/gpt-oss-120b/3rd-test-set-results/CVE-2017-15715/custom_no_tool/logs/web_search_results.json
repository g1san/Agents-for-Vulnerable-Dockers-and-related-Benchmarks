    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201115715 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server (httpd) that affects versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.29. The flaw resides in the handling of the <FilesMatch> directive\u2019s regular\u2011expression engine. When a filename contains a newline character, the end\u2011of\u2011string anchor ($) is incorrectly treated as matching the newline instead of the true end of the string. This allows an attacker to craft filenames such as \"evil.php\\n.txt\" that bypass file\u2011type restrictions imposed by <FilesMatch> rules. By uploading a file that would normally be blocked (for example a PHP script), the attacker can place malicious code in the web\u2011root. If the server is configured to execute files of that type, the attacker can achieve remote code execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the host.",
