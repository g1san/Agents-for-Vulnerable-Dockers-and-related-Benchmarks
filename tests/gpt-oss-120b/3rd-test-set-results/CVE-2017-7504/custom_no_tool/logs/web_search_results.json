    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20117504 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Red\u202fHat JBoss Application Server version 4.x and earlier. The flaw resides in the class `HTTPServerILServlet` which implements the JMS\u2011over\u2011HTTP invocation layer of JBossMQ. The servlet reads the raw HTTP request body and deserializes it without any validation of the object types. An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted Java serialized payload to the servlet endpoint (typically `http://<host>:8080/jbossmq-httpil/HTTPServerILServlet`). During deserialization, arbitrary classes can be instantiated and their code executed on the server process, granting the attacker full system privileges. The vulnerability is classified as unsafe Java deserialization (CWE\u2011502) and results in remote execution of arbitrary commands, such as creating files, downloading additional malware, or opening reverse shells. Because the servlet is enabled by default in JBossMQ, exploitation does not require any additional services or authentication; merely network access to the HTTP endpoint is sufficient. The impact rating is a CVSS base score of 9.8, indicating a severe threat to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
