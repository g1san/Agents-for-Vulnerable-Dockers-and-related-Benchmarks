    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20111427 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.3.8 and 1.4.3. The flaw resides in the built\u2011in Groovy scripting engine that is used by the Elasticsearch REST API, especially the \\_search endpoint. The engine is supposed to run scripts inside a sandbox that restricts which Java classes can be accessed. However, the sandbox can be bypassed by invoking a whitelisted class (java.lang.Math) and then using Java reflection (Math.class.forName) to load arbitrary classes such as java.lang.Runtime. Once the Runtime class is obtained, an attacker can call Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...) to execute any operating\u2011system command on the host. The exploit requires no authentication; any client that can reach the Elasticsearch HTTP API (default port 9200) can send a crafted JSON query containing a Groovy script and gain execution of arbitrary code, typically with the same privileges as the Elasticsearch process (often root when run inside a container). The vulnerability was discovered by the Cisco Security Team and publicly disclosed in 2015. It affects Elasticsearch 1.3.0\u20111.3.7 and 1.4.0\u20111.4.2. The issue is fixed in Elasticsearch 1.3.8, 1.4.3 and later versions. Exploits are publicly available and have been integrated into scanning tools such as Nmap\u2019s http\u2011vuln\u2011cve2015\u20111427 script.",
