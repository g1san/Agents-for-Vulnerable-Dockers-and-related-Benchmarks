    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201116509 is a vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter. The flaw resides in the handling of a failed `grestore` operation which disables the `LockSafetyParams` check and bypasses the internal `/invalidaccess` validation that is supposed to enforce the `-dSAFER` sandbox. By supplying a specially\u2011crafted PostScript (or EPS) file, an attacker can cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary shell commands via the `-c` option or the `pipe` instruction, even when the interpreter is started with the `-dSAFER` safety flag. The vulnerability is present in all Ghostscript releases prior to version\u202f9.24. Exploitation requires only that the vulnerable Ghostscript binary be invoked on untrusted PostScript/EPS input, which occurs in many image\u2011processing pipelines (for example, Python Pillow, web services that generate thumbnails, document conversion services, etc.). Successful exploitation results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the process running Ghostscript.",
