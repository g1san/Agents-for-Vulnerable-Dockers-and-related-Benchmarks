    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201139141 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the webui\u2011aria2 project. The Node.js server (node-server.js) builds the file path directly from the URL path (req.path) without sanitising it or ensuring the file resides inside the intended web\u2011root directory. An unauthenticated attacker can request paths such as ../../../../etc/passwd and the server will return the contents of any file that the process\u2019s user (usually www) is allowed to read. This results in complete disclosure of readable files on the host, including configuration files, credentials, source code and any other sensitive data. The flaw exists in all published releases of the webui\u2011aria2 npm package and in the latest source commit (hash 109903f0e2774cf948698cd95a01f77f33d7dd2c). No patched version has been released.",
