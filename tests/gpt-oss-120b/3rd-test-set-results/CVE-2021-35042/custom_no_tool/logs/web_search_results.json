{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-35042 is a high\u2011severity SQL injection vulnerability in the Django web framework. The flaw exists in Django's QuerySet.order_by() implementation. When a view accepts a user\u2011controlled ordering parameter (commonly via a query\u2011string like `?order_by=...`) and passes it directly to the `order_by()` method, Django fails to properly sanitize the input on certain vulnerable versions. The attacker can inject arbitrary SQL fragments into the ORDER BY clause, which are then concatenated into the final SQL statement sent to the database. This allows unauthenticated remote execution of any SQL command, enabling data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially full compromise of the application and underlying system. The vulnerability affects Django 3.1.x versions earlier than 3.1.13 and Django 3.2.x versions earlier than 3.2.5. It was patched in Django 3.1.13 and 3.2.5.",
