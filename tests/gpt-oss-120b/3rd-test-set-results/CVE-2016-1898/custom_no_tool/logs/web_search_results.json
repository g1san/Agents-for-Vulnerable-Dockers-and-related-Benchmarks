    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20111898 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg 2.x that affects the handling of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist files (*.m3u8). When FFmpeg parses a playlist it accepts any URI scheme without proper validation. An attacker can embed a malicious `subfile` or `concat` URI that references a local file on the host. FFmpeg then constructs an outbound HTTP request that includes the contents of the referenced file. This results in two separate attack effects: Server Side Request Forgery, where the vulnerable server is forced to make arbitrary network requests, and Arbitrary File Read, where the contents of any readable file on the host are disclosed to an attacker-controlled server. The flaw is present in all FFmpeg 2.x releases prior to the patch releases 2.5.10, 2.6.7, 2.7.5, and 2.8.5. Exploitation requires only that a malicious playlist be processed by FFmpeg, which is common in web applications that accept user\u2011uploaded media and invoke FFmpeg for transcoding or thumbnail generation.",
