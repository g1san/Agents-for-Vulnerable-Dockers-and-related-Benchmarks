    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20113704, popularly known as \"Drupalgeddon\", is a pre\u2011authentication SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal 7 core. The flaw resides in the `expandArguments()` function of the database abstraction layer, which builds prepared statements incorrectly. An attacker can supply a specially crafted array whose keys are incorporated directly into the SQL query without proper escaping, allowing arbitrary SQL commands to be executed. Successful exploitation enables an unauthenticated remote attacker to read, modify, or delete any data in the Drupal database, reset the admin password, create new admin accounts, and ultimately achieve full compromise of the web application and its underlying system.",
