    "desc": "CVE-2021-28169 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty web server that affects the ConcatServlet (and related WelcomeFilter). The servlet decodes the request path to enforce that it does not reference resources inside the protected WEB-INF or META-INF directories. After the initial decode, the path is passed to a RequestDispatcher which decodes it a second time. An attacker can supply a doubly\u2011encoded URL (for example `/%2557EB-INF/web.xml`) that passes the first check but is decoded a second time to `/WEB-INF/web.xml`. This bypasses the directory restriction and allows the server to return files from the WEB-INF folder, such as `web.xml` or other configuration files. The flaw results in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information without requiring authentication. The issue is fixed in Jetty versions 9.4.41, 10.0.3, and 11.0.3 and later.",
