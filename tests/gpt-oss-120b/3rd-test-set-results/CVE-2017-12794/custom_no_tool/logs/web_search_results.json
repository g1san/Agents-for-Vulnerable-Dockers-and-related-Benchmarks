    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201112794 is a reflected cross\u2011site scripting vulnerability in the Django web framework. The flaw exists in the technical 500 debug page (django/views/debug.py) that is displayed when the Django setting DEBUG is set to True. In vulnerable versions the template disables HTML auto\u2011escaping for part of the page and renders the exception cause (frame.exc_cause) without proper sanitisation. An attacker who can trigger a server error that includes attacker\u2011controlled data (for example a database IntegrityError that echoes a submitted value) can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the debug page. When a victim visits the page, the script executes in the victim\u2019s browser, allowing theft of cookies, session data, or execution of actions on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability is present in Django versions 1.10.0\u20111.10.7 and 1.11.0\u20111.11.4. It is mitigated by upgrading to Django 1.10.8, 1.11.5 or later, or by ensuring that DEBUG is set to False in production.",
