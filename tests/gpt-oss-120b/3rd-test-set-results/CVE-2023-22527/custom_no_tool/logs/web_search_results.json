    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201122527 is a critical server\u2011side template injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data\u202fCenter. The flaw resides in the Velocity templating engine used by Confluence to render page content. An unauthenticated attacker can supply a crafted value to the `label` parameter of the `/template/aui/text-inline.vm` endpoint, which is processed by Velocity and OGNL without proper sanitisation. The injected template executes arbitrary OGNL/Struts2 code that ultimately invokes a Freemarker Execute utility, allowing the attacker to run any operating\u2011system command on the host. This results in full remote code execution with the privileges of the Confluence process. Versions affected include all 8.0\u20118.4.x releases and 8.5.0\u20118.5.3. Fixed releases are Confluence 8.5.4 (LTS), 8.5.5 (LTS), 8.6.0 and later for Data\u202fCenter.",
