    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u20114450 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the JeecgBoot low\u2011code platform\u2019s built\u2011in reporting tool JimuReport. The vulnerable endpoint /jeecg-boot/jmreport/queryFieldBySql (also accessible as /jmreport/queryFieldBySql) accepts a JSON field named `sql` that is directly embedded into a FreeMarker template and rendered without any validation or sandboxing. An attacker can inject FreeMarker expressions such as `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` to run arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the server. The flaw is unauthenticated and does not require any prior login. Successful exploitation results in full server compromise, data breach, service disruption and possible lateral movement. The vulnerability is present in all JimuReport versions prior to 1.6.0 and is fixed starting with version 1.6.1.",
