    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201126084 is a critical unauthenticated OGNL (Object\u2011Graph Navigation Language) injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center. The flaw resides in the WebWork framework that processes OGNL expressions received from HTTP requests. An attacker can craft a request that injects arbitrary OGNL code, which is then evaluated by the server, allowing the execution of any operating\u2011system command with the privileges of the Confluence process. The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild and does not require any authentication or prior knowledge of the target instance. All Confluence Server/Data Center releases prior to the fixed builds are vulnerable, including every 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x version that precedes the patches released in 6.13.23, 7.4.11, 7.11.6, 7.12.5 and later. Exploitation merely requires the ability to send a crafted HTTP request to a reachable Confluence endpoint (default ports 8090/8080). Successful exploitation results in full remote code execution on the host, enabling attackers to install malware, create new user accounts, or further compromise the network.",
