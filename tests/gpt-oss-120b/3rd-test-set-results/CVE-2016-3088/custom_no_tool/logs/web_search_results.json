    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20113088 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the built\u2011in Fileserver web application of Apache ActiveMQ. The Fileserver servlet accepts arbitrary files via an HTTP PUT request and later allows those files to be moved to an executable location with an HTTP MOVE request. Because there is no authentication or validation, an unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious JSP (or other script) and relocate it into the admin or web\u2011apps directory of the ActiveMQ web console. Accessing the moved file causes the server to execute the attacker\u2011controlled code with the privileges of the ActiveMQ process, leading to full compromise of the host. The flaw exists in all ActiveMQ 5.x releases prior to version 5.14.0 and was fixed in version 5.14.0 where the Fileserver component was removed.",
