    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201146604 is a critical vulnerability in the Java OpenWire protocol implementation used by Apache ActiveMQ (both Classic and Artemis). The OpenWire marshaller deserializes attacker\u2011controlled data without proper validation. An attacker who can reach the broker or any Java\u2011based OpenWire client can send a specially crafted OpenWire command that forces the target JVM to instantiate an arbitrary class from its classpath with a String argument. The chosen class can execute operating\u2011system commands during construction, resulting in remote code execution on the broker or client. The vulnerability affects the default OpenWire port 61616 and does not require authentication. Apache ActiveMQ Classic ships with Spring\u2019s `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which can be abused by providing a malicious XML configuration over HTTP. Artemis includes the vulnerable marshaller as well, though a public exploit is not yet known. Patching the OpenWire marshaller in the listed releases removes the unsafe deserialization path. Exploitation prerequisites are simply network access to the OpenWire endpoint and the presence of a class on the classpath that runs code when instantiated with a String. Successful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to run arbitrary shell commands, leading to full system compromise.",
