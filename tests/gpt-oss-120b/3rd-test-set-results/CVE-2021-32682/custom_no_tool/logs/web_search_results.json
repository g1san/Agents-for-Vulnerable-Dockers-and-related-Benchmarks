    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201132682 is a critical vulnerability in the PHP connector of the open\u2011source web\u2011based file manager elFinder. The flaw resides in the default connector script (e.g., connector.minimal.php) which processes file\u2011system commands supplied via HTTP parameters such as `cmd`, `target`, and `name`. The connector fails to properly sanitise these parameters, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to perform several dangerous actions: arbitrary file creation or overwrite, arbitrary file deletion, arbitrary file move/rename, and command injection when creating archive files. By uploading a malicious PHP or PHAR file to a web\u2011accessible directory or by injecting shell arguments into the archive command, the attacker can execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the server with the privileges of the web\u2011server process, achieving full remote code execution. The vulnerability is present in all elFinder releases up to and including version 2.1.58. It was fixed in version 2.1.59, where path sanitisation, MIME block\u2011list, and archive handling were tightened. Exploitation requires the connector to be publicly reachable and the server to allow execution of uploaded PHP files.",
