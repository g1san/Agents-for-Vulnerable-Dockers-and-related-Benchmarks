    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111000861 is a critical vulnerability in the Stapler web framework that is bundled with Jenkins core. The flaw resides in the method\u2011binding logic of Stapler, which maps HTTP URL segments to Java object methods via reflection. Because Stapler automatically exposes any public method whose name starts with `get`, `do` or similar patterns, an attacker can craft a URL that forces Jenkins to invoke arbitrary methods on internal objects. This unrestricted reflective access allows the injection and execution of attacker\u2011controlled Java code, leading to full remote code execution on the Jenkins server without any authentication. The vulnerability affects all Jenkins releases that include the vulnerable Stapler version, namely Jenkins core versions up to 2.153 (including LTS 2.138.3 and earlier). Exploitation requires only network access to the Jenkins HTTP interface; no additional plugins or credentials are needed. Successful exploitation can be used to create arbitrary in\u2011memory user objects, trigger privileged background work, read sensitive data, or execute operating\u2011system commands, which attackers have leveraged for activities such as cryptomining and establishing persistence via cron. Patching to Jenkins 2.154 (or LTS 2.138.4 / 2.150.1) introduces a whitelist filter in Stapler that blocks unintended method bindings and mitigates the issue.",
