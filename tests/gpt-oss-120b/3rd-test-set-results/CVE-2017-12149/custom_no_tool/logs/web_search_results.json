    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201112149 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Red\u202fHat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and JBoss Application Server (including WildFly). The flaw is an insecure Java deserialization path exposed through the HTTP\u2011invoker/jmx\u2011invoker servlet (e.g., `/jmx-invoker/` or `/invoker/readonly`). The servlet accepts attacker\u2011controlled serialized Java objects over HTTP and deserializes them without proper validation. By sending a specially crafted serialized payload (commonly generated with the ysoserial tool), an unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger execution of arbitrary Java bytecode on the server, resulting in full remote command execution with the privileges of the JBoss process. The vulnerability affects multiple JBoss releases that ship the vulnerable servlet and can be exploited simply by issuing an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.",
