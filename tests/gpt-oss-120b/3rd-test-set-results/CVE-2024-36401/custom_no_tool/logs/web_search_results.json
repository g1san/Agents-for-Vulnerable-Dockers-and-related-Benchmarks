    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201136401 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache\u202fGeoServer. The flaw resides in the handling of property\u2011name expressions that are treated as XPath expressions by the GeoTools/commons\u2011jxpath stack. An attacker can send crafted OGC service requests (WFS, WMS, WPS, etc.) containing malicious XPath payloads. The server evaluates these payloads, causing the Java runtime to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands without authentication. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to obtain a remote shell, download and run additional malware, and compromise the host system. The vulnerability affects default installations of GeoServer versions earlier than the patched releases 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4 and 2.25.2.",
