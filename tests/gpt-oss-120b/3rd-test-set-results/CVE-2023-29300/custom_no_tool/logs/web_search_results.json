    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201129300 is a pre\u2011authentication remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in ColdFusion's Web Distributed Data eXchange (WDDX) deserialization logic. An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted WDDX payload to any accessible ColdFusion Component (CFC) endpoint (for example /CFIDE/adminapi/accessmanager.cfc). The payload is processed by the WddxDeserializer, which uses Java reflection to instantiate arbitrary classes. By injecting the class com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl (or any other gadget with a public no\u2011argument constructor and setter methods), the attacker triggers a JNDI lookup that can load malicious code from an attacker\u2011controlled LDAP server, resulting in full operating\u2011system command execution on the ColdFusion server. The vulnerability affects all supported ColdFusion releases that have not been updated past the versions listed in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB\u201123\u201140: ColdFusion\u202f2018 Update\u202f16 and earlier, ColdFusion\u202f2021 Update\u202f6 and earlier, and ColdFusion\u202f2023 GA (2023.0.0.330468) and earlier. Successful exploitation gives the attacker complete control of the server, allowing them to install web\u2011shells, exfiltrate data, and pivot to other systems.",
