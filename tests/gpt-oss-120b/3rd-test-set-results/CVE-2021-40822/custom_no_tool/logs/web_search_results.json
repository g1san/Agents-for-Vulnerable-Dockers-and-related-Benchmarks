    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201140822 is a Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the configuration option that allows setting a proxy host for WMS/WFS services. GeoServer fails to validate the supplied URL, enabling an unauthenticated attacker to cause the server to issue arbitrary HTTP or HTTPS requests to any address reachable from the server\u2019s network, such as internal metadata services (e.g., 169.254.169.254) or other internal applications. The attacker can retrieve data from internal services, enumerate the internal network, or use the SSRF as a stepping\u2011stone for further attacks. The vulnerability is present in all GeoServer releases up to 2.18.5 (inclusive) and in the 2.19.x series up to 2.19.2 (inclusive). It was fixed in GeoServer 2.19.3 and later versions.",
