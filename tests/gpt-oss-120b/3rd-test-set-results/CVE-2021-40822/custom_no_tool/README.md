# Docker setup for CVE-2021-40822

This repository provides a minimal Docker Compose configuration that builds and runs the vulnerable version of GeoServer affected by CVE‑2021‑40822. The environment is ready for security researchers to reproduce the Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability.

## How to run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The service will be exposed on port **8080** of the host machine.

## What this does

- The `Dockerfile` builds GeoServer **2.18.5** from the official binary distribution, ensuring the exact vulnerable version is used.
- No external image pull is required, so the setup works even on isolated air‑gapped environments where public registries are not reachable.
- The Compose file only contains a `build:` block; Docker will automatically build the image before starting the container.

## Important notes

- Run this environment only in an isolated network, as the service is intentionally vulnerable.
- All necessary ports are published automatically; no additional configuration steps are needed.
- The container starts GeoServer in its default configuration which includes the proxy‑host setting that triggers CVE‑2021‑40822.
