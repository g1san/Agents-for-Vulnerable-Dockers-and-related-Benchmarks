    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u201123211 is a critical Server\u2011Side Template Injection vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes web application. The flaw resides in `recipes/cookbook/helper/template_helper.py` where user\u2011supplied recipe text is rendered directly by the Jinja2 engine without sanitisation. An attacker can embed Jinja2 payloads that cause the template engine to evaluate arbitrary Python code, which in turn can invoke `subprocess` to run operating\u2011system commands. In the default Docker\u2011Compose deployment the application runs as the root user, so the injected commands are executed with full root privileges inside the container, potentially leading to complete host compromise, secret exfiltration, and lateral movement. The vulnerability affects all released versions up to and including 1.5.23 and is fixed starting with version 1.5.24.",
