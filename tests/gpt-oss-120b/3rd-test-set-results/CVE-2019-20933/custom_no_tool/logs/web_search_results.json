    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u201120933 is an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting InfluxDB versions up to and including 1.7.5. The flaw resides in the `authenticate` function of the HTTP service (source file `services/httpd/handler.go`). When a JSON\u2011Web\u2011Token (JWT) is presented whose `SharedSecret` field is empty, the server incorrectly treats the token as valid and grants full access without requiring a username or password. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can send arbitrary InfluxQL queries to the `/query` endpoint, create or drop databases, read and modify time\u2011series data, and perform actions equivalent to having administrative credentials. The vulnerability is exploited over the standard InfluxDB HTTP API (default port 8086) and does not require any additional components. The issue was fixed in InfluxDB 1.7.6, where the authentication logic now correctly validates the presence of a shared secret.",
