    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20113714, also known as ImageTragick, is a vulnerability in the ImageMagick graphics library. Certain image coders (such as EPHEMERAL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN and PLT) invoke external programs via the system call. In ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.3\u201110 (for the 6.x branch) and prior to 7.0.1\u20111 (for the 7.x branch), these coders do not properly filter shell\u2011meta characters that can be embedded in specially crafted image files. When a malicious image is processed, the embedded characters are passed to the shell, causing the execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the ImageMagick process. The flaw can be triggered through PHP code that uses the imagick extension, bypassing disabled PHP functions, resulting in remote code execution on the server.",
