For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nVersions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.\n\nWhen a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nA bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",
