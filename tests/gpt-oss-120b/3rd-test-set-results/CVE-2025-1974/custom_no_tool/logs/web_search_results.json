    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u20111974 is a critical vulnerability in the Ingress\u2011NGINX controller for Kubernetes. The controller runs a validating admission webhook that processes Ingress objects. The webhook creates a temporary NGINX configuration and executes `nginx -t` to validate it. Because the webhook is reachable from any pod on the cluster network and does not require authentication, a malicious pod can submit a crafted AdmissionReview request containing an Ingress definition with specially crafted annotations or object fields. These fields are injected into the temporary NGINX configuration. The `ssl_engine` directive, which can be placed anywhere in the configuration, permits loading of an arbitrary shared library. An attacker can first upload a malicious shared\u2011object file into the controller pod\u2019s temporary filesystem using NGINX\u2019s client\u2011body buffering mechanism, then point the injected `ssl_engine` directive at that library. When the webhook runs `nginx -t`, the malicious library is loaded and executed, giving the attacker code execution inside the controller pod. The controller runs with a highly privileged service account that has cluster\u2011wide read access to all Secrets, so the attacker can also read every secret in the cluster, leading to full cluster compromise. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical). It affects all Ingress\u2011NGINX controller images prior to version 1.11.5 and prior to version 1.12.1. The fixes are available in Ingress\u2011NGINX controller versions 1.11.5 and 1.12.1 and later.",
