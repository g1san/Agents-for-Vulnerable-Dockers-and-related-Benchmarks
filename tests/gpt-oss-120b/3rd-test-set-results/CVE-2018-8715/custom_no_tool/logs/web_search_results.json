    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20118715 is a logic flaw in the Embedthis AppWeb web server (and the underlying Embedthis HTTP library) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the server's authentication mechanisms. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request the vulnerable AppWeb instance treats the request as already authenticated, granting access to protected resources or administrative functions. All AppWeb releases prior to version 7.0.3 are affected. No prior authentication, credentials, or privileged access are required; only network\u2011visible HTTP access to the server is needed. The vulnerability is rated high severity (CVSS 3.0 score 8.1\u20139.8). The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to AppWeb version 7.0.3 or later, which corrects the faulty authentication condition.",
