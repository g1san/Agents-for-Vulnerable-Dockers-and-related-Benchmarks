{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201114574 is an open\u2011redirect vulnerability in Django's CommonMiddleware. When a request with a path that does not end with a slash is not matched by any URL pattern, the middleware appends a slash and, if the new path resolves, issues an HTTP redirect. By supplying a path that begins with a double slash (e.g., //evil.com), the generated redirect URL starts with //, which browsers treat as an absolute\u2011scheme URL and therefore redirect the user to an attacker\u2011controlled domain. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to craft links that appear to point to a legitimate site but actually forward victims to malicious locations, enabling phishing, credential harvesting, or other attacks that rely on trusted\u2011domain redirects.",
