    "desc": "CVE-2022-24816 is a code\u2011injection vulnerability in the JAI\u2011EXT jt\u2011jiffle component that is used by GeoServer to compile Jiffle raster\u2011algebra scripts. When a Jiffle script is supplied to GeoServer through the Web Processing Service (WPS) or Web Map Service (WMS) endpoint, the jt\u2011jiffle extension generates Java source code that includes the original script comments without proper escaping. The generated source is then compiled at runtime by the Janino compiler. By closing the automatically added comment block and injecting arbitrary Java code, an attacker can cause the compiled class to be loaded and its static initializer executed, which can run any command on the host (for example,\u202fRuntime.getRuntime().exec(...)). The flaw requires no authentication, can be triggered over the network, and results in remote code execution with full system privileges. The vulnerability affects all versions of jt\u2011jiffle prior to 1.1.22; consequently, any GeoServer release that bundles a jt\u2011jiffle version older than 1.1.22 is vulnerable.",
