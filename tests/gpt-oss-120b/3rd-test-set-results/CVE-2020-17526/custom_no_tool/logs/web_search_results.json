    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201117526 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache Airflow\u2019s webserver component.  Versions of Airflow prior to 1.10.15 and prior to 2.0.2 ship with a hard\u2011coded Flask secret key (`temporary_key`) in the *airflow.cfg* file.  The web UI uses this key to sign the Flask session cookie. Because the key is static and known, an attacker can capture a legitimate ``session`` cookie from any Airflow instance, decode it with tools such as *flask\u2011unsign*, change the ``user_id`` field to an administrator\u2019s identifier, re\u2011sign the cookie with the same static key, and replay it against a vulnerable target.  The forged cookie is accepted as valid, granting the attacker unauthenticated administrative access to the Airflow UI.  Once logged in, the attacker can view and edit DAGs, trigger arbitrary tasks, read connection strings and environment variables, and execute Bash commands via the DAG Code Editor, potentially compromising downstream systems such as AWS accounts.  The issue is fixed in Airflow 1.10.15 and 2.0.2, where the default secret key was removed and a random key is generated at startup.  Deployments that keep the default key are vulnerable regardless of any other configuration.",
