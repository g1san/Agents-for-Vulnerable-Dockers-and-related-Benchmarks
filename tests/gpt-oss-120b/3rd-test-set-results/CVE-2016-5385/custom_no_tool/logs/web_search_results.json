    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20115385, also known as the httpoxy vulnerability, is a CGI\u2011style namespace clash that occurs when a web server running a CGI or FastCGI runtime copies the incoming HTTP header named `Proxy` into the environment variable `HTTP_PROXY`. PHP versions up to 7.0.8 (including PHP 5.6 series) do not strip this header, so any PHP application that reads the `HTTP_PROXY` variable to configure outbound HTTP requests will unintentionally use the attacker\u2011provided proxy address. This enables an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject a malicious proxy via a crafted request, causing the server to route its own outbound traffic through the attacker\u2019s proxy. The resulting impact is server\u2011side request forgery\u2011type behavior, allowing data exfiltration, man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle attacks, or further compromise of internal services.",
