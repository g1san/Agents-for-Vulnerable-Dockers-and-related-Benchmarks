    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20113337 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Elasticsearch HTTP server that serves site plugins. When a site plugin (such as head, Marvel, BigDesk, or Kopf) is installed, the plugin handler fails to sanitise \"..\" path components in URLs under the `/_plugin/` endpoint. An attacker who can reach the Elasticsearch HTTP API can craft a request like `GET /_plugin/<plugin>/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` which causes Elasticsearch to resolve the path outside the plugin directory and return the raw bytes of any file that the Elasticsearch process can read. This enables arbitrary file read on the host, exposing configuration files, credentials, private keys, or any other readable data, and can be a stepping\u2011stone for further compromise. The flaw exists in all Elasticsearch releases prior to 1.4.5 and in the 1.5.x line prior to 1.5.2, and it requires at least one site plugin to be present.",
