    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201143441 is a critical authentication\u2011bypass vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph\u2011Server. Versions of HugeGraph\u2011Server released before 1.5.0 (i.e., 1.0.0 through 1.4.x) mishandle JSON Web Tokens by treating token data as immutable. An attacker can forge or replay a JWT and bypass the built\u2011in authentication mechanism, gaining full unauthenticated access to the graph database. This allows reading, writing, and deleting any graph data as well as executing privileged server operations, resulting in complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Public exploits exist and the vulnerability has a CVSS\u202f3.1 score of 9.8.",
