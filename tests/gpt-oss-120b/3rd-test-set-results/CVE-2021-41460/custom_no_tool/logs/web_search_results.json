    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201141460 is a remote SQL injection vulnerability in ECShop version 4.1.0. The ECShop web\u2011shop application builds SQL queries by concatenating user\u2011supplied input without proper sanitisation or parameterisation. An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and inject arbitrary SQL statements. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read, modify or delete data stored in the ECShop database, including user credentials, order information and configuration settings, potentially leading to full compromise of the e\u2011commerce site.",
