    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111000533 is a command\u2011parameter injection vulnerability in the GitList web application (versions 0.6.0 and earlier). The application concatenates a user\u2011controlled parameter directly into a shell command without proper sanitisation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary operating\u2011system commands. When a crafted request is sent to the vulnerable endpoint, the injected command is executed by the web\u2011server process, granting remote code execution on the host. The flaw resides entirely within GitList itself; no additional components are required for exploitation other than a web server capable of running the PHP application.",
