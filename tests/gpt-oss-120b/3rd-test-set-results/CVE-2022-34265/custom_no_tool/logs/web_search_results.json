    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201134265 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the Django Python web\u2011framework. The ORM functions `Trunc()` and `Extract()` accept a string argument (`kind` for Trunc, `lookup_name` for Extract) that is interpolated directly into the generated SQL without proper sanitisation. An attacker who can control this argument can inject arbitrary SQL statements, allowing reading, modification or deletion of data in the database. The flaw is present in all Django releases prior to 3.2.14 and prior to 4.0.6. Exploits typically send a crafted GET request such as `/extract/?lookup_name=year%20FROM%20start_datetime))%20OR%201=1;SELECT%20pg_sleep(5)--` which results in the injected statement being executed by the database.",
