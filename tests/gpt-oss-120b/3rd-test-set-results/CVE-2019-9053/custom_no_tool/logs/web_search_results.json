    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20119053 is an unauthenticated blind time\u2011based SQL injection vulnerability that resides in the News module of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS). The flaw exists in the handling of the `m1_idlist` (or `idlist`) parameter of the `moduleinterface.php` endpoint. When a crafted request containing a leading comma and a malicious payload (e.g., `,1)) AND (SELECT SLEEP(5))--`) is sent, the application builds an SQL `IN (\u2026)` clause without proper sanitisation, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL. By making the database pause for a configurable number of seconds, an attacker can infer true/false conditions and therefore enumerate data such as admin usernames, email addresses, and password hashes. Because the injected SQL can also be used to write files or execute system commands, the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the host. Exploitation only requires network access to the vulnerable web service; no authentication or prior foothold is needed. Mitigation is achieved by upgrading CMS Made Simple to version 2.2.10 or later, or by applying patches that validate and sanitise the `idlist` parameter.",
