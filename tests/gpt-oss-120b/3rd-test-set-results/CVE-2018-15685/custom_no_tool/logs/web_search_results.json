    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201115685 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Electron framework. The flaw resides in the handling of the `webPreferences` object when creating nested windows or iframes with the options `nativeWindowOpen: true` or `sandbox: true`. In affected Electron versions the security\u2011related properties (such as `nodeIntegration` and `contextIsolation`) are not correctly inherited by the newly created window. When inheritance fails Electron falls back to insecure defaults (`nodeIntegration: true` and `contextIsolation: false`). An attacker who can influence the content loaded in a parent window or inject an iframe can cause a child window to obtain full Node.js access, allowing arbitrary file\u2011system operations and execution of native code on the host machine. The vulnerability affects Electron versions 1.7.0 through 1.7.15, 1.8.0 through 1.8.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.7, and 3.0.0\u2011beta.1 through 3.0.0\u2011beta.6. It was patched in Electron 1.7.16, 1.8.8, 2.0.8, and 3.0.0\u2011beta.7.",
