{
    "desc": "CVE-2023-51449 is a path\u2011traversal (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability in the Gradio web\u2011app framework. The flaw resides in the `/file` endpoint where the code that checks the requested path against Gradio's temporary directory does not correctly handle sub\u2011directories. An attacker can first create a sub\u2011folder via the `/upload` endpoint and then request a file using traversal sequences such as `../` or URL\u2011encoded `%2e%2e%2f` to read any file on the host filesystem. This allows unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, `/proc/self/environ` (exposing environment variables and secrets), configuration files, source code, or any other readable file. The vulnerability affects Gradio versions from early releases up to 4.10 inclusive and all versions prior to 3.33. It is fixed starting with Gradio version 4.11.0. The impact is high confidentiality loss, as arbitrary file read can lead to credential leakage, especially in Hugging Face Spaces deployments.",
