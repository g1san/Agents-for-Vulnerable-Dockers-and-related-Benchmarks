    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20116271, also known as Shellshock, is a critical vulnerability in the GNU Bash interpreter. Bash incorrectly parses function definitions embedded in environment variables; a specially crafted value such as `X=() { :;}; malicious_command` causes Bash to execute the trailing code when it processes the variable, even if the variable is never used. Any service that launches Bash with attacker\u2011controlled environment variables\u2014most notably CGI scripts executed by a web server, OpenSSH sessions that use forced commands, and DHCP client scripts\u2014can be exploited. The result is arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the vulnerable Bash process, allowing a remote attacker to fully compromise the host.",
