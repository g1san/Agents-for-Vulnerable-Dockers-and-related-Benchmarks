    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20115531 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Elasticsearch core HTTP Snapshot\u2011Restore API. The flaw resides in the snapshot endpoint implementation, which fails to properly sanitize file\u2011path parameters. An attacker can craft a request containing \"../\" sequences (or URL\u2011encoded equivalents) that cause the Elasticsearch JVM process to read files outside the intended backup directory. Because the Elasticsearch REST interface is typically exposed on port 9200, any network\u2011accessible node can issue the malicious request without authentication or special privileges. The vulnerability allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to retrieve arbitrary files that the Elasticsearch process can read, such as system configuration files, SSH private keys, log files, or any other sensitive data stored on the host. Versions of Elasticsearch from 1.0.0 through 1.6.0 are affected. The issue was patched in Elasticsearch 1.6.1 and later 1.7.0. Mitigations for unpatched nodes include restricting access to the snapshot API with firewalls, reverse proxies, or enabling X\u2011Pack security (Shield).",
