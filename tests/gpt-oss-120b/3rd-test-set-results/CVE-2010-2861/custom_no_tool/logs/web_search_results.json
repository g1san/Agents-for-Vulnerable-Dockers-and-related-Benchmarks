    "desc": "CVE\u20112010\u20112861 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion Administrator console. The flaw resides in the `locale` parameter of several administrative CFM pages (most notably `enter.cfm`). The parameter is not properly validated, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject `../` path\u2011traversal sequences (often combined with a null byte) and cause ColdFusion to read arbitrary files from the server\u2019s file system. By requesting files such as `WEB-INF/cfusion/lib/password.properties`, the attacker can obtain the ColdFusion administrator password hash and salt. ColdFusion accepts the raw hash (or a computed HMAC) as a valid password, enabling the attacker to log in to the admin console without cracking the password. Once logged in, the attacker can use built\u2011in administrative functions\u2014such as creating scheduled tasks, uploading CFM files, or editing existing application code\u2014to achieve full compromise of the web application and the underlying host. The impact includes complete information disclosure of credential stores, configuration files, and source code, followed by full administrative control and potential remote command execution. The vulnerability affects Adobe ColdFusion versions 8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, and 9.0.1. It was addressed by Adobe security bulletin APSB10\u201118 and requires upgrading to a patched version or applying the vendor hot\u2011fix.",
