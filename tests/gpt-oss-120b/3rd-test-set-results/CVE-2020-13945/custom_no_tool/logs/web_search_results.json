    "desc": "Apache APISIX is an open\u2011source API gateway that provides a RESTful Admin API for managing routes, plugins, upstreams and other configuration objects. In versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 the product ships with a hard\u2011coded default admin token (for example `edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1`). When the Admin API IP\u2011restriction rules are removed or widened, this default token can be presented by any client without further authentication. An attacker who can reach the Admin API endpoint can use the default token to gain full administrative privileges, create or modify routes or plugins that execute arbitrary Lua code, and consequently execute arbitrary system commands on the host. This results in remote code execution with the privileges of the APISIX process.",
