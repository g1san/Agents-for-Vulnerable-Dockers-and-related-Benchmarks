# CVE‑2019‑6116 Test Environment

This directory contains a ready‑to‑run Docker Compose stack that reproduces the vulnerable environment required for CVE‑2019‑6116.

## How to start
```bash
cd ./../../dockers/CVE-2019-6116/custom_no_tool
docker compose up --build -d
```

The stack consists of two services:

* **vulnerable_dind** – a Docker‑in‑Docker daemon built on the Debian Buster‑based `docker:20.10-dind-buster` image. It installs the exact vulnerable `ghostscript` package (version 9.26).
* **ghostserve** – a lightweight Python HTTP server that serves the sample PDFs placed in the `pdfs` directory.

Both services are exposed on their default ports (2376 for the nested Docker daemon and 8080 for the HTTP server) and require no manual configuration.

## Test data
A single sample PDF (`sample.pdf`) is provided in the `pdfs` folder and can be accessed via:
```
http://localhost:8080/sample.pdf
```
