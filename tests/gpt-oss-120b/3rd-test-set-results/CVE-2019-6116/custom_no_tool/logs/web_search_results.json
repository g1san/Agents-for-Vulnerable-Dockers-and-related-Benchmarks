    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116116 is a heap\u2011based buffer overflow and sandbox\u2011bypass vulnerability in the Ghostscript interpreter (the GPL PostScript/PDF processing suite). The flaw resides in the pdfopt.c parser and in the handling of transient PostScript procedures. A crafted PDF or PostScript file can overflow an internal heap buffer or manipulate the procedure\u2011management code, allowing an attacker to bypass the -dSAFER sandbox and execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. The vulnerability is present in all Ghostscript releases up to and including version 9.26. Exploitation requires only that Ghostscript be invoked on untrusted document input; no additional services or privileges are needed.",
