    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201142342 is a critical vulnerability in the GoAhead embedded web server (versions 4.x and 5.x prior to 5.1.5). The flaw resides in the built\u2011in CGI file\u2011upload handler when the file\u2011upload filter is enabled. During processing of a multipart/form\u2011data request, the server converts uploaded form fields into operating\u2011system environment variables. Normally each variable is prefixed with `CGI_` to limit what reaches the CGI script. In the vulnerable code path this prefix is omitted, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary environment variables such as `LD_PRELOAD`. By setting `LD_PRELOAD` to point to a malicious shared object uploaded in the same request (for example using the file descriptor `/proc/self/fd/0`), the attacker forces the GoAhead process to preload and execute attacker\u2011controlled code. This results in full remote code execution without authentication, giving the attacker complete control over the host system. The vulnerability affects millions of Internet\u2011exposed devices that embed GoAhead, including many IoT and networking products. The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to GoAhead version 5.1.5 or later, or to disable the file\u2011upload filter and block untrusted `LD_*` environment variables.",
