    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201126134 is a critical unauthenticated OGNL injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center. The flaw resides in the request handling pipeline where the HTTP request URI is parsed and passed to the OGNL expression evaluator without proper sanitisation. An attacker can craft a URL containing a malicious OGNL expression such as `${@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec(\"whoami\")}`. When the vulnerable Confluence instance processes the request, the expression is evaluated, resulting in the execution of arbitrary operating\u2011system commands as the user that runs the Confluence service. This vulnerability requires no authentication and works with any HTTP method, allowing remote code execution on internet\u2011facing Confluence installations. Active exploitation was observed shortly after disclosure, and successful exploitation can lead to full control of the host, including reading files, creating new user accounts, or obtaining a reverse shell.",
