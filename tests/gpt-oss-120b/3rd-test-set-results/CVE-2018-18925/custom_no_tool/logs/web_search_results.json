    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201118925 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the self\u2011hosted Git service Gogs. The flaw resides in Gogs' file\u2011based session provider, which builds the path to a session file by concatenating a user\u2011supplied session identifier with the session directory without validating the identifier. An attacker can supply a session ID containing directory\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\"), causing the server to read or write arbitrary files outside the intended session directory. By placing a crafted Gob\u2011encoded session file that represents an admin user, the attacker can bypass authentication, gain administrative privileges, and then create malicious Git hooks or upload files that are executed by the server, achieving full remote command execution on the host running Gogs.",
