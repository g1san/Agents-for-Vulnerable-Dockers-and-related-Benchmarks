## CVE-2018-18925 vulnerable Docker setup (Gogs)

This directory contains a Docker Compose configuration that reproduces the vulnerability described in **CVE-2018-18925** using a vulnerable Gogs version.

### How to run
```bash
cd ./../../dockers/CVE-2018-18925/custom_no_tool
docker compose up -d
```
The vulnerable Gogs service will be reachable on port **3000** of the host (web UI) and port **22** for SSH access.

### Exploitation
The container runs with the environment variable `VULN_MODE=exploitable`, which triggers the vulnerable code path in the listed Gogs versions (0.11.x). Use the appropriate proof‑of‑concept scripts or tools to verify the directory‑traversal session ID flaw and achieve remote code execution.

All containers start automatically and are ready for testing; no manual steps are required.
