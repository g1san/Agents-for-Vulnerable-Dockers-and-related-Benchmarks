    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20113120 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Elasticsearch versions prior to 1.2. The flaw originates from the default configuration that enables dynamic scripting (Groovy, MVEL, etc.) without sandboxing. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the Elasticsearch REST API (typically the _search endpoint) containing a script field that executes arbitrary commands on the host running Elasticsearch. Because the scripting engine runs with the full privileges of the Elasticsearch process, the attacker can read, modify, or create files and execute system commands, leading to complete compromise of the host. Exploitation only requires network access to the Elasticsearch HTTP interface (default port 9200) and does not need authentication or prior credentials.",
