    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20115254 is a vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ that allows unsafe deserialization of Java objects sent in a JMS ObjectMessage. When a crafted serialized payload is delivered to the broker\u2019s OpenWire listener (default TCP port 61616), the broker deserializes the object without restricting the classes that can be loaded. This enables an attacker who can connect to the broker to execute arbitrary commands on the host running ActiveMQ, resulting in full remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in all ActiveMQ 5.x releases prior to version 5.13.0.",
