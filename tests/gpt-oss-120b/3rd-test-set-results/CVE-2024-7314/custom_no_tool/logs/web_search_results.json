    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u20117314 is a critical authentication\u2011bypass vulnerability in the anji\u2011plus AJ\u2011Report web application. An unauthenticated remote attacker can append the string `;swagger\u2011ui` to any HTTP request URL, which forces the server to serve the Swagger UI interface without performing any authentication checks. The exposed Swagger UI allows the attacker to invoke privileged endpoints and execute arbitrary Java code on the server, resulting in full remote code execution and complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The flaw affects all AJ\u2011Report releases prior to version 1.4.1 and requires only network access to the vulnerable service; no credentials, prior login, or user interaction are needed.",
