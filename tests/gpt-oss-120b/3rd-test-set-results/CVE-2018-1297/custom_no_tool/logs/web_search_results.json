    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111297 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache JMeter. The flaw resides in the RMI\u2011based remote engine used for distributed testing. When JMeter is started in server mode (e.g., with `jmeter\u2011server.bat`), it opens an unauthenticated RMI registry on TCP port 1099 and binds a `JMeterEngine` object. An attacker who can reach this RMI port can obtain a reference to the `JMeterEngine` and invoke arbitrary methods. By sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object\u2014commonly generated with the ysoserial tool using payloads such as CommonsCollections1\u2014the attacker forces JMeter to deserialize the object, which triggers execution of attacker\u2011controlled code with the privileges of the JMeter process. The impact is full system compromise, often with root or administrator rights. The vulnerability affects all Apache JMeter 2.x and 3.x releases and Apache JMeter 4.0 prior to the patch released in version 4.0.1. Mitigation requires upgrading to a patched JMeter version, disabling the insecure RMI listener, or restricting network access to port 1099.",
