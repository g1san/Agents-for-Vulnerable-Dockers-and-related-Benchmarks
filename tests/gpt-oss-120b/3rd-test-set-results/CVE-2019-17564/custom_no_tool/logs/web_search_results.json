    "desc": "Apache Dubbo is a high\u2011performance Java RPC framework. When the optional HTTP protocol is enabled, Dubbo\u2019s HTTP remoting component (`dubbo\u2011rpc\u2011http\u2011invoker`) accepts the body of a POST request and deserializes it directly using Java\u2019s `ObjectInputStream` without any validation. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized Java object (for example using the Commons\u2011Collections4 gadget chain) and send it to the HTTP endpoint. The unsafe deserialization triggers execution of attacker\u2011controlled code on the Dubbo provider, giving full remote code execution with the privileges of the Dubbo process. The vulnerability is present in all 2.5.x releases, in 2.6.0 through 2.6.7, and in 2.7.0 through 2.7.4. The issue is fixed starting with Dubbo 2.7.5. Exploitation requires only that the HTTP protocol be enabled and reachable; no authentication or additional services are strictly required.",
