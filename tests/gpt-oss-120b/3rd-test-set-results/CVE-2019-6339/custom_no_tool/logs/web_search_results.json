    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116339 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core. The flaw resides in the PHP phar:// stream wrapper handling inside Drupal's file\u2011handling subsystem. An attacker who can supply a crafted phar:// URI (typically via the \u201cTemporary directory\u201d configuration form at /admin/config/media/file-system) can cause Drupal to treat an uploaded file as a PHAR archive. When Drupal processes this path, the PHAR metadata is deserialized and the attacker\u2011controlled PHP code is executed with the privileges of the web\u2011server process, leading to full compromise of the Drupal site and the underlying host.",
