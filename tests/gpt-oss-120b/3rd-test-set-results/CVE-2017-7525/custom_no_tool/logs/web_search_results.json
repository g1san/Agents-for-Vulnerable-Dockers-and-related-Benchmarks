    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20117525 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in the FasterXML Jackson\u2011databind library. The flaw resides in the `ObjectMapper.readValue()` method when Jackson's default typing feature is enabled. Versions of jackson-databind prior to 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1, and 2.8.9 allow an unauthenticated attacker to supply a crafted JSON payload that triggers unsafe polymorphic type resolution. This results in the creation of arbitrary Java objects and execution of attacker\u2011controlled code (CWE\u2011502). Apache Cassandra 3.11.4 bundles a vulnerable version of jackson\u2011databind and therefore inherits this weakness. Any Cassandra endpoint that deserializes user\u2011supplied JSON with default typing enabled can be exploited, leading to full remote code execution on the server process. The vulnerability was disclosed in April\u202f2017 and is fixed in later releases of jackson\u2011databind and in patched Cassandra builds.",
