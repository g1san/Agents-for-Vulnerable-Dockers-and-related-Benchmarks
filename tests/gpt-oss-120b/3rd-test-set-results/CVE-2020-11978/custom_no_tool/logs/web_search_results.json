    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111978 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.11. The flaw resides in the built\u2011in example DAGs that are installed by default (specifically `example_trigger_target_dag`). When the experimental REST API is enabled and unauthenticated (the default configuration for Airflow <=1.10.10), an attacker can send a crafted request to the API endpoint that starts a run of the vulnerable DAG. The DAG contains a command\u2011injection flaw, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary operating\u2011system commands that are executed by the Airflow worker or scheduler process with the privileges of the Airflow service. The vulnerability can be combined with CVE\u20112020\u201113927 to bypass additional restrictions, but exploitation is possible on its own via the unauthenticated experimental API.",
