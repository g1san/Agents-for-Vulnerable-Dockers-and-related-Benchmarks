    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201143008 is a vulnerability in the Adminer web\u2011based database management tool (written in PHP). Versions from 1.0 through 4.6.2 are affected. The flaw is caused by insufficient validation of the `file` parameter used by Adminer\u2019s import/export functionality and by improper access control when Adminer connects to a remote MySQL server. An attacker can craft a request that forces Adminer to read any file that the web server process can access on the host file system and return its contents to the attacker. This arbitrary file read can disclose configuration files, database credentials, source code, SSH keys or any other sensitive data stored on the server, facilitating further compromise. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication simply by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Adminer endpoint. The issue is fixed in Adminer version 4.6.3 and later.",
