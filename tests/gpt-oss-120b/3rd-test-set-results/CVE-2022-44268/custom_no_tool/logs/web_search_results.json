    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201144268 is an information\u2011disclosure vulnerability in ImageMagick (the core image\u2011processing library and its command\u2011line utilities such as `convert` and `magick`). The flaw resides in the handling of PNG text chunks whose keyword is `profile` (or similar). When ImageMagick parses a crafted PNG that contains a text chunk with the keyword `profile` and a value that specifies a file path, the library treats the value as a filename and reads the raw contents of that file as if it were an image profile. The read data is then embedded into the output image metadata. An attacker who can supply a malicious PNG to any service that processes images with a vulnerable ImageMagick version can cause the binary to read any file that the process has permission to access (for example `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, private keys, etc.) and later extract the contents from the generated image. No code execution is required; the impact is limited to unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the host system. The vulnerability is present in ImageMagick versions up to and including 7.1.0\u201149 and up to and including 7.1.0\u201155. It is mitigated by upgrading to ImageMagick 7.1.0\u201150 or later (for the first range) and to 7.1.0\u201156 or later (for the second range), or by disabling processing of untrusted PNG files, running ImageMagick in a sandbox, and restricting filesystem permissions.",
