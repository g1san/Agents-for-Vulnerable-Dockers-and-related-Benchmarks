    "desc": "CVE-2017-1000028 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.1. The flaw resides in the server\u2019s file\u2011serving component and allows a remote attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing \"../\" sequences. Because the server does not properly validate or normalize the requested path, the attacker can escape the web\u2011root directory and read arbitrary files from the underlying file system. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, requires low complexity, and results in high confidentiality loss as sensitive configuration files, credentials, or source code may be disclosed. No impact on integrity or availability is reported. Public exploits exist (e.g., Exploit\u2011DB IDs 45196 and 45198). Mitigation requires applying the vendor\u2011provided patch or upgrading to a fixed GlassFish release and/or restricting external access to the server.",
