    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201110054 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine. The flaw resides in the built\u2011in web console of H2 (org.h2.server.web.WebServlet). When the console is started with the non\u2011default flag `webAllowOthers=true` or otherwise exposed to remote hosts, an attacker who can reach the console can issue a `CREATE ALIAS` statement that binds a user\u2011defined name to arbitrary Java code. The attacker then calls the alias to execute the malicious Java payload with the privileges of the H2 process. This allows execution of any code on the host machine, compromising developer workstations or any server that runs an exposed H2 console.",
