    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201122515 is a critical broken access control vulnerability in self\u2011hosted Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. Versions 8.0.0 through 8.5.1 expose public /setup/* endpoints that do not enforce authentication. An unauthenticated attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to endpoints such as /setup/setupadministrator.action, causing the application to create a new user and add it to the confluence\u2011administrators group. This gives the attacker full administrative control over the Confluence instance, allowing read, modification, exfiltration of all content, installation of malicious plugins, and any other privileged action. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable from the Internet on any publicly reachable Confluence deployment that has not been patched or had the /setup/* path blocked.",
