# CVE‑2023‑22515 Reproduction Environment

This composition sets up a vulnerable **Atlassian Confluence** instance (version 8.4.5) together with a PostgreSQL database (13‑alpine). The stack can be started with:

```bash
cd ./../../dockers/CVE-2023-22515/custom_no_tool
docker compose up -d
```

- Confluence will be reachable at `http://localhost:8090`.
- PostgreSQL is exposed on port `5432` (useful for debugging).

The environment mirrors the vulnerable configuration where the `/setup/*` endpoints are accessible without authentication, allowing the CVE‑2023‑22515 exploit to be demonstrated.

**No manual steps are required**; the database is created automatically and Confluence will initialize itself on first start.
