    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u20119402 is a SQL injection vulnerability in Django\u2019s geographic information system (GIS) layer when the application uses an Oracle database backend. The flaw resides in the handling of the `tolerance` argument that is passed to GIS functions and aggregate operations. Django builds the Oracle SQL statement by inserting the raw `tolerance` value into the query string without proper validation or escaping. An attacker who can influence the `tolerance` parameter (for example via a GET or POST parameter that is used in a GIS annotation or aggregation) can inject arbitrary SQL fragments. This allows execution of any Oracle SQL command, leading to data exfiltration, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or further compromise of the host system. The vulnerability is present in Django 1.11 versions prior to 1.11.29, Django 2.2 versions prior to 2.2.11, and Django 3.0 versions prior to 3.0.4. The issue was fixed in Django 1.11.29, 2.2.11, and 3.0.4, where the `tolerance` argument is validated and forced to be a numeric value before being incorporated into the SQL statement.",
