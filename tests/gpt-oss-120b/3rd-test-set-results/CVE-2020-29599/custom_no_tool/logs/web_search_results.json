    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201129599 is a vulnerability in the ImageMagick library (the core lib component). Versions of ImageMagick prior to 6.9.11\u201140 and 7.0.10\u201140 contain a flaw in the handling of the `-authenticate` option that is used when processing password\u2011protected PDF files (and also affects SVG handling). The option accepts a password string that is inserted directly into a shell command without proper escaping. When a crafted PDF (or SVG) supplies a password containing shell metacharacters such as `;`, `&&` or back\u2011ticks, ImageMagick executes the embedded commands with the privileges of the ImageMagick process. This results in arbitrary command execution, allowing an attacker to gain full control of the host system. The vulnerability can be triggered by any application or script that invokes ImageMagick\u2019s `convert`, `magick`, or `mogrify` utilities on untrusted PDF or SVG files. The issue was reported in November\u202f2020 and was patched in ImageMagick 6.9.11\u201140 and 7.0.10\u201140. Exploitation does not require any network interaction; it only needs local or remote code that can supply a malicious file to the vulnerable ImageMagick binary.",
