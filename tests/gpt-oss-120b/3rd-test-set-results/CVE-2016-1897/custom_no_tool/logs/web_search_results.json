    "desc": "CVE-2016-1897 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg 2.x that occurs when the program parses HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlists (M3U8 files). The playlist handling code does not validate the URLs that appear in the playlist. An attacker can supply a crafted playlist containing URLs that use arbitrary protocols such as http, file, concat, or subfile. When FFmpeg processes the malicious playlist it blindly follows those URLs, causing the program to make network requests to any address (server\u2011side request forgery) and to read local files via the concat or subfile protocols. By chaining subfile segments an attacker can retrieve the full contents of any file readable by the FFmpeg process. The vulnerability results in the disclosure of internal network resources and arbitrary local file contents, potentially leaking sensitive configuration data, credentials, or other private information. The issue is fixed in FFmpeg 2.8.5 and later; all earlier 2.x releases are vulnerable.",
