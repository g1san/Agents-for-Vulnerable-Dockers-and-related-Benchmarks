    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201141678 is a vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ that affects the embedded Jetty server exposing the Jolokia HTTP\u2011JMX bridge (AgentServlet) at the path /api/jolokia.  When an attacker authenticates to the ActiveMQ web console (or otherwise gains access to the Jolokia endpoint) they can send a crafted HTTP request that is processed by the Jolokia servlet.  The servlet parses JSON payloads and creates JMX requests which are then handled by `org.jolokia.handler.ExecHandler`.  By invoking Java Management Extensions (JMX) operations\u2014specifically the FlightRecorder MXBean on Java 11 and later\u2014an attacker can write an arbitrary JSP file into the broker\u2019s web directory and execute it.  This chain results in remote code execution without requiring additional privileges beyond a valid admin\u2011role credential.  The vulnerability is present in ActiveMQ releases prior to the security fixes and is identified as a remote code execution issue.",
