    "desc": "CVE-2023-26360 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the JSON deserialization logic of the ColdFusion application server. An attacker can send a specially crafted request containing malicious serialized data to a ColdFusion endpoint (for example, a CFC under /CFIDE). The server deserializes this data without proper validation, which leads to the execution of attacker\u2011controlled code in the context of the ColdFusion process. The vulnerability can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the file system, execute operating\u2011system commands, or drop persistent web\u2011shells. No authentication, prior knowledge of credentials, or user interaction is required; merely having network access to the vulnerable ColdFusion service is sufficient. Adobe assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical). The issue affects multiple product versions and was patched in the March\u202f2023 security updates.",
