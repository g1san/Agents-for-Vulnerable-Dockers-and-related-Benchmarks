    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201119475 is a flaw in Artifex Ghostscript versions prior to 9.26. The vulnerability resides in the restore handling code of Ghostscript. During a restore operation Ghostscript temporarily disables the safety flags LockSafetyParams and LockFilePermissions. If an error (such as a stack overflow) occurs after the internal restore but before the PostScript\u2011level .setuserparams restores the flag, the safety flag remains disabled. An attacker can then set the OutputFile parameter to the %pipe% operator and cause Ghostscript to execute an arbitrary shell command even when it is started with the -dSAFER option. This bypass of the SAFER sandbox allows remote code execution with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. The issue was fixed in Ghostscript 9.26 (released 20\u202fNov\u202f2018).",
