    "desc": "CVE-2024-27348 is a critical remote command execution vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph Server. The flaw resides in the server\u2019s Gremlin/graph query interface and JSON deserialization logic, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to send crafted HTTP requests that are processed by the server\u2019s JVM. The malicious payload bypasses input validation and is executed on the host, giving the attacker full control of the system. All deployments of Apache HugeGraph Server versions 1.0.0 through 1.2.x (including 1.2.1) running on Java\u202f8 or Java\u202f11 are affected. Exploitation requires only network access to the server\u2019s REST API; no authentication or additional privileges are needed. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.0 when compiled with Java\u202f11 and when the built\u2011in authentication mechanism is enabled.",
