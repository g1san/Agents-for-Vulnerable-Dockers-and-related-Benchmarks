    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20113066 is a critical Java deserialization vulnerability located in the Apache BlazeDS library that is bundled with Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw exists because ColdFusion does not restrict the classes that can be deserialized when processing BlazeDS messages (typically AMF or Flex messaging requests). An attacker can send a specially\u2011crafted request containing malicious serialized Java objects to any endpoint that uses BlazeDS (for example\u202f`/flex2gateway/` or `/messagebroker/`). The server will deserialize the attacker\u2011controlled data without validation, causing arbitrary Java objects to be instantiated and executed. This results in remote code execution with the full privileges of the ColdFusion application server, allowing complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, network\u2011reachable, and requires no user interaction. Affected Adobe ColdFusion releases are:\n- ColdFusion\u202f2016\u202f(Update\u202f3 and earlier)\n- ColdFusion\u202f11\u202f(Update\u202f11 and earlier)\n- ColdFusion\u202f10\u202f(Update\u202f22 and earlier)\nAdobe released hot\u2011fixes that replace the vulnerable BlazeDS version in ColdFusion\u202f2016\u202fUpdate\u202f4, ColdFusion\u202f11\u202fUpdate\u202f12, and ColdFusion\u202f10\u202fUpdate\u202f23. Until those updates are applied, any deployment of the vulnerable ColdFusion versions inside Docker is susceptible to this remote code execution attack.",
