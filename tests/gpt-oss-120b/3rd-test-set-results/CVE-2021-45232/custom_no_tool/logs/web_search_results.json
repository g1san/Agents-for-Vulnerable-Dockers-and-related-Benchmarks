    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201145232 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard. The dashboard mixes two Go web frameworks (droplet and gin). Authentication middleware is only applied to the droplet\u2011based routes, while several gin\u2011based API endpoints are exposed without any authentication check. An unauthenticated attacker can call these Manager API endpoints to read or modify gateway configuration objects such as routes, services, upstreams and plugins. Because the dashboard allows arbitrary Lua scripts to be supplied in plugin configurations, the attacker can inject malicious Lua code that is executed by the dashboard process, resulting in remote code execution on the host running the dashboard. The vulnerability affects all Dashboard releases from version 2.7.0 up to and including version 2.10.0. It was fixed in version 2.10.1 where the authentication checks are correctly enforced on all routes.",
