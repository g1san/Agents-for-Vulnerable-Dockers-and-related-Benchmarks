    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u20111561 is a vulnerability in the Gradio web UI framework that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the host filesystem. The flaw resides in the `/component_server` endpoint, which permits callers to invoke any method of a Gradio Component object with attacker\u2011controlled arguments. By invoking the `Block.move_resource_to_block_cache` method and supplying an arbitrary file path, the server copies the specified file into a temporary directory that is served over HTTP. The attacker can then retrieve the file via a subsequent GET request, resulting in unauthorized local file read. Versions of Gradio prior to 4.13.0 (including 3.47\u20113.50.2 and 4.3\u20114.12) are vulnerable. The issue can be exploited when a Gradio app is exposed publicly (e.g., using `share=True` or hosted on Hugging Face Spaces), leading to potential disclosure of sensitive configuration files, credentials, API keys, and other secret material.",
