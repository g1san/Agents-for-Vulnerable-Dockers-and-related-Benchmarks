    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201121311 is a Server\u2011Side Request Forgery vulnerability in the Adminer single\u2011file PHP database management tool. Versions 4.0.0 through 4.7.8 (including the all\u2011driver bundle `adminer.php`) accept attacker\u2011controlled parameters for the database driver, server, username, password and database. These parameters are used to compose an internal HTTP request to the supplied \u201cserver\u201d value without proper validation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can therefore cause the Adminer instance to send arbitrary HTTP requests to internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, or any reachable host, and the response is reflected back to the attacker. This enables internal network probing, data exfiltration, and, in cloud environments, theft of instance metadata such as AWS IAM credentials. The flaw is fixed in Adminer version 4.7.9, which sanitises the server parameter and blocks outbound requests.",
