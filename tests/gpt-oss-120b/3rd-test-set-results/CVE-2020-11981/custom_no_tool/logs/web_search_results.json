    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111981 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.10 when the CeleryExecutor (or CeleryKubernetesExecutor) is used. Airflow stores Celery task payloads as Python pickle objects and does not validate them before deserialization. An attacker who can submit a malicious DAG or directly write to the message broker can craft a pickle that executes arbitrary code on the Celery worker. The malicious payload is transmitted through the broker (Redis or RabbitMQ) and is executed by the worker process, giving the attacker full command\u2011execution rights on the host running the worker.",
