    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201142323 is a critical vulnerability in Apache HertzBeat versions up to 1.5.x. The application\u2019s REST API endpoints (/api/monitors/import and /api/alert/defines/import) accept user\u2011supplied YAML files. HertzBeat uses the SnakeYAML library to deserialize these files without any validation or sanitisation. An attacker who can authenticate to the HertzBeat service can upload a crafted YAML payload that forces SnakeYAML to deserialize arbitrary Java objects (for example a malicious org.h2.jdbc.JdbcConnection). This results in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the HertzBeat process, giving the attacker full control of the host system. The vulnerability is fixed in HertzBeat 1.6.0, where unsafe deserialization is disabled and input validation is added.",
