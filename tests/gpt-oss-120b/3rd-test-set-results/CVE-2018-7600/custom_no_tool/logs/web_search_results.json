{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-7600, also known as Drupalgeddon2, is a critical vulnerability in the core of the Drupal content\u2011management system. The flaw resides in Drupal's Form API and render system where specially crafted render\u2011array keys (such as #post_render, #pre_render, #access_callback or #lazy_builder) are processed during page or AJAX rendering without proper sanitisation. An unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious HTTP request that injects a PHP function (for example exec, system, eval or passthru) into these keys. When Drupal later renders the array, the injected function is executed with the privileges of the web\u2011server process, allowing arbitrary operating\u2011system command execution, file upload, reverse\u2011shell creation, or deployment of additional malicious payloads. The vulnerability affects Drupal 7 core versions earlier than 7.58 and Drupal 8 core versions earlier than 8.3.9, 8.4.6 and 8.5.1. Successful exploitation results in full remote code execution on the host running the vulnerable Drupal site.",
