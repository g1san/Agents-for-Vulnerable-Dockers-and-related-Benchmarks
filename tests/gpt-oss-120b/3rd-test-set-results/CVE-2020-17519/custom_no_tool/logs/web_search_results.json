    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201117519 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Apache Flink\u2019s JobManager REST API. The handler `JobManagerCustomLogHandler` builds a file path directly from a request parameter without sanitising it, allowing an attacker to supply path\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\") that escape the intended log directory. By sending a specially crafted request to the JobManager endpoint, an attacker can read any file that the JobManager process can access on the host filesystem, such as configuration files, credentials, or system files like /etc/passwd. The vulnerability affects specific Flink releases and is fixed in later versions that properly normalise the filename.",
