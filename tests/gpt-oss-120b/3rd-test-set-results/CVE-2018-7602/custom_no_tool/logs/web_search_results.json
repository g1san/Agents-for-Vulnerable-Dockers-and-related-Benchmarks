    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20117602 is a highly critical remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core. The flaw resides in Drupal's input handling and request sanitisation, allowing an attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests that cause arbitrary PHP code to be executed on the server process (typically as the www\u2011data user). The vulnerability is publicly known as \u201cDrupalgeddon\u202f3\u201d and is referenced by security advisory SA\u2011CORE\u20112018\u2011002. It can be exploited remotely without authentication (or with a low\u2011privilege authenticated session depending on the version) and has been observed in the wild.",
