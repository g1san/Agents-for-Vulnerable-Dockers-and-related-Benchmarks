{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-17562 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the GoAhead embedded web server. The flaw resides in the CGI handling code (src/cgi.c) where the server builds the environment for a CGI script directly from HTTP request parameters without sanitisation. An attacker can supply dangerous environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD, causing the dynamic linker to load an attacker\u2011controlled shared object when a dynamically\u2011linked CGI binary is executed. By posting a malicious ELF\u2011SO payload and referencing it via a file descriptor path (e.g., /proc/self/fd/0), the attacker can achieve execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process. The vulnerability affects all GoAhead versions from 2.5 up to, but not including, 3.6.5. The exploit requires only the vulnerable GoAhead service with CGI enabled; no authentication is needed.",
