    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201135042 is a remote code execution vulnerability in GeoServer's Web Processing Service (WPS). The flaw resides in the handling of the wps:Execute operation, specifically when a wps:LiteralData element is supplied. GeoServer passes the supplied literal value directly to java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(), allowing an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host running GeoServer. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted XML WPS request that includes a malicious script or command string. Exploitation was observed in the wild in June\u202f2023, enabling attackers to gain full control of the server, steal data, disrupt services, or launch further attacks. The issue is linked to the Jiffle raster\u2011algebra processor, which compiles Jiffle scripts with the Janino compiler; the compiled code can embed calls to Runtime.exec(). The vulnerability affects GeoServer 2.x releases that bundle the vulnerable Jiffle/Jai\u2011ext components, notably GeoServer versions from 2.18.6 through 2.20.4. Patches released after version 2.20\u202fdisable the unsafe script execution path, and disabling the WPS service also mitigates the risk.",
