Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.  The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.",

However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.  The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.  The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.  The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.  While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs. We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",

      "description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.",

      "description": "Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.  Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low.  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding.  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.  Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.

Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenarios where you only load trusted configurations. \n\nUsers that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues.

On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated.  This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in.\n\nThere is no known path for an attacker to induce such an exception to be thrown, thus they must rely on an application to throw such an exception.    The OP has also identified that during the call to `sessionDestroyed`, the `getLastAccessedTime()` throws an `IllegalStateException`, which potentially contrary to the servlet spec, so applications calling this method may always throw and fail to log out.  If such an application was only tested on a non clustered test environment, then it may be deployed on a clustered environment with multiple contexts and fail to log out.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe application should catch all Throwables within their `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` implementations.\n",

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.  However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check' option.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the \"-check\" option.

IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks.

XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.",

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

      "description": "### Overview\n\nA flaw in Jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible **information disclosure** in systems using **pooled or reused buffers**, like Netty or Vert.x.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability affects the creation of exception messages like:\n\n```\nJsonParseException: Unexpected character ... at [Source: (byte[])...]\n```\n\nWhen `JsonFactory.createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len)` is used, and an error occurs while parsing, the exception message should include a snippet from the specified logical payload. However, the method `_appendSourceDesc` ignores the `offset`, and always starts reading from index `0`.\n\nIf the buffer contains residual sensitive data from a previous request, such as credentials or document contents, that data may be exposed if the exception is propagated to the client.\n\nThe issue particularly impacts server applications using:\n\n* Pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty)\n* Frameworks that surface parse errors in HTTP responses\n* Default Jackson settings (i.e., `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` is enabled)\n\nA documented real-world example is [CVE-2021-22145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145) in Elasticsearch, which stemmed from the same root cause.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker sends malformed JSON to a service using Jackson and pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty-based HTTP servers). If the server reuses a buffer and includes the parser’s exception in its HTTP 400 response, the attacker may receive residual data from previous requests.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1000];\nSystem.arraycopy(\"SECRET\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 0, 6);\nSystem.arraycopy(\"{ \\\"bad\\\": }\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 700, 10);\n\nJsonFactory factory = new JsonFactory();\nJsonParser parser = factory.createParser(buffer, 700, 20);\nparser.nextToken(); // throws exception\n\n// Exception message will include \"SECRET\"\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via [PR #652](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652).\n\nAll users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by:\n\n1. **Disabling exception message exposure to clients** — avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses.\n2. **Disabling source inclusion in exceptions** by setting:\n\n   ```java\n   jsonFactory.disable(JsonFactory.Feature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION);\n   ```\n\n    This prevents Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\n\n### References\n* [Pull Request #652 (Fix implementation)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652)\n* [CVE-2021-22145 (Elasticsearch exposure of this flaw)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145)",

      "description": "### Overview\n\nA flaw in Jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible **information disclosure** in systems using **pooled or reused buffers**, like Netty or Vert.x.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability affects the creation of exception messages like:\n\n```\nJsonParseException: Unexpected character ... at [Source: (byte[])...]\n```\n\nWhen `JsonFactory.createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len)` is used, and an error occurs while parsing, the exception message should include a snippet from the specified logical payload. However, the method `_appendSourceDesc` ignores the `offset`, and always starts reading from index `0`.\n\nIf the buffer contains residual sensitive data from a previous request, such as credentials or document contents, that data may be exposed if the exception is propagated to the client.\n\nThe issue particularly impacts server applications using:\n\n* Pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty)\n* Frameworks that surface parse errors in HTTP responses\n* Default Jackson settings (i.e., `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` is enabled)\n\nA documented real-world example is [CVE-2021-22145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145) in Elasticsearch, which stemmed from the same root cause.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker sends malformed JSON to a service using Jackson and pooled byte buffers (e.g., Netty-based HTTP servers). If the server reuses a buffer and includes the parser’s exception in its HTTP 400 response, the attacker may receive residual data from previous requests.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n```java\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1000];\nSystem.arraycopy(\"SECRET\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 0, 6);\nSystem.arraycopy(\"{ \\\"bad\\\": }\".getBytes(), 0, buffer, 700, 10);\n\nJsonFactory factory = new JsonFactory();\nJsonParser parser = factory.createParser(buffer, 700, 20);\nparser.nextToken(); // throws exception\n\n// Exception message will include \"SECRET\"\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via [PR #652](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652).\n\nAll users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by:\n\n1. **Disabling exception message exposure to clients** — avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses.\n2. **Disabling source inclusion in exceptions** by setting:\n\n   ```java\n   jsonFactory.disable(JsonFactory.Feature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION);\n   ```\n\n    This prevents Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\n\n### References\n* [Pull Request #652 (Fix implementation)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652)\n* [CVE-2021-22145 (Elasticsearch exposure of this flaw)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22145)",

This will be included into the filter and provides the attacker ability to specify additional attributes in the search query. This can be exploited as a blind LDAP injection: an attacker can enumerate valid attribute values using the boolean blind injection technique. The exploitation depends on the structure of the target LDAP directory, as well as what kind of errors are exposed to the user.\n\nChanges to the `X509LDAPCertStoreSpi.java` class add the additional checking of any X.500 name used to correctly escape wild card characters.",

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.  For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.",

It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function.\n\n```java\npublic static byte[] shuffle(int[] input) throws IOException {\n        byte[] output = new byte[input.length * 4];\n        int numProcessed = impl.shuffle(input, 0, 4, input.length * 4, output, 0);\n        assert(numProcessed == input.length * 4);\n        return output;\n    }\n\n```\n\nSince the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a “java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException” exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as “java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException”.\nThe same issue exists also when using the “shuffle” functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\nCompile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.BitShuffle;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        int[] original = new int[0x40000000];\n        byte[] shuffled = BitShuffle.shuffle(original);\n        System.out.println(shuffled[0]);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe program will crash, showing the following error (or similar):\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0\n\tat org.example.Main.main(Main.java:12)\n\nProcess finished with exit code 1\n\n```\n\nAlternatively - compile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.BitShuffle;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        int[] original = new int[0x20000000];\n        byte[] shuffled = BitShuffle.shuffle(original);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe program will crash with the following error (or similar):\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -2147483648\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.BitShuffle.shuffle(BitShuffle.java:108)\n\tat org.example.Main.main(Main.java:11)\n```",

It does so by multiplying the length by 2 and passing it to the [rawCompress](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/Snappy.java#L422) function.\n\n```java\npublic static byte[] compress(char[] input)\n            throws IOException\n    {\n        return rawCompress(input, input.length * 2); // char uses 2 bytes\n    }\n\n```\n\nSince the length is not tested, the multiplication by two can cause an integer overflow and become negative. The rawCompress function then uses the received length and passes it to the natively compiled maxCompressedLength function, using the returned value to allocate a byte array.\n\n```java\n    public static byte[] rawCompress(Object data, int byteSize)\n            throws IOException\n    {\n        byte[] buf = new byte[Snappy.maxCompressedLength(byteSize)];\n        int compressedByteSize = impl.rawCompress(data, 0, byteSize, buf, 0);\n        byte[] result = new byte[compressedByteSize];\n        System.arraycopy(buf, 0, result, 0, compressedByteSize);\n        return result;\n    }\n\n```\n\nSince the maxCompressedLength function treats the length as an unsigned integer, it doesn’t care that it is negative, and it returns a valid value, which is casted to a signed integer by the Java engine. If the result is negative, a “java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException” exception will be raised while trying to allocate the array “buf”. On the other side, if the result is positive, the “buf” array will successfully be allocated, but its size might be too small to use for the compression, causing a fatal Access Violation error.\nThe same issue exists also when using the “compress” functions that receive double, float, int, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue. The issue most likely won’t occur when using a byte array, since creating a byte array of size 0x80000000 (or any other negative value) is impossible in the first place.\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\nCompile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.Snappy;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        char[] uncompressed = new char[0x40000000];\n        byte[] compressed = Snappy.compress(uncompressed);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe program will crash, creating crashdumps and showing the following error (or similar):\n\n```\n#\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\n#\n#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x0000000063a01c20, pid=21164, tid=508\n#\n.......\n```\n\n\nAlternatively - compile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.Snappy;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        char[] uncompressed = new char[0x3fffffff];\n        byte[] compressed = Snappy.compress(uncompressed);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe program will crash with the following error (or similar), since the maxCompressedLength returns a value that is interpreted as negative by java:\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -1789569677\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.Snappy.rawCompress(Snappy.java:425)\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.Snappy.compress(Snappy.java:172)\n\tat org.example.Main.main(Main.java:10)\n\n```",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

      "description": "# Impact\n\nThere is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file and also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output.\n\n# Patches\n\nPatched in AntiSamy 1.7.4 and later. See important remediation details in the reference given below.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to a fixed version of the library, the following mitigation can be applied until you can upgrade: Manually edit your AntiSamy policy file (e.g., antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting its value to `false`,  if present. Also it would be useful to make AntiSamy remove the `noscript` tag by adding this in your tag definitions under the `<tagrules>` node (or deleting it entirely if present):\n```xml\n<tag name=\"noscript\" action=\"remove\"/>\n```\n\nAs the previously mentioned policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work, changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this library. However, the existing bug would still be present in AntiSamy or its parser dependency (neko-htmlunit). The safety of this workaround relies on configurations that may change in the future and don't address the root cause of the vulnerability. As such, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to a fixed version of AntiSamy.\n\n# For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail one of the project co-leaders, listed on the [OWASP AntiSamy project](https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy/) page, under \"Leaders\".",

      "description": "# Impact\n\nThere is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output.\n\n# Patches\n\nPatched in AntiSamy 1.7.5 and later. This is due to parsing behavior in the [neko-htmlunit](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit-neko) dependency, just by updating to a newer version the issue was solved. See important remediation details in the reference given below.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to a fixed version of the library, the following mitigation can be applied until you can upgrade: Manually edit your AntiSamy policy file (e.g., antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting its value to `false`,  if present.\n\nAs the previously mentioned policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work, changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this library. However, the existing bug would still be present in the parser dependency (neko-htmlunit) and therefore in AntiSamy. The safety of this workaround relies on configurations that may change in the future and don't address the root cause of the vulnerability. As such, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to a fixed version of AntiSamy.\n\n# For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail one of the project co-leaders, listed on the [OWASP AntiSamy project](https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy/) page, under \"Leaders\".\n",

      "description": "## Summary\n\nEclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.\n\n## Details\n\n### Affected components\n\nThe vulnerable component is the `HttpURI` class when used as a utility class in an application.  The Jetty usage of the class is not vulnerable.\n\n### Attack overview\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does not well validate the authority section of a URI. When presented with an illegal authority that may contain user info (eg username:password#@hostname:port), then the parsing of the URI is not failed.  Moreover, the interpretation of what part of the authority is the host name differs from a common browser in  that they also do not fail, but they select a different host name from the illegal URI.\n\n### Attack scenario\n\nA typical attack scenario is illustrated in the diagram below. The Validator checks whether the attacker-supplied URL is on the blocklist. If not, the URI is passed to the Requester for redirection. The Requester is responsible for sending requests to the hostname specified by the URI.\n\nThis attack occurs when the Validator is the `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI` class and the Requester is the `Browser` (include chrome, firefox and Safari). An attacker can send a malformed URI to the Validator (e.g., `http://browser.check%23%40vulndetector.com/` ). After validation, the Validator finds that the hostname is not on the blocklist. However, the Requester can still send requests to the domain with the hostname `vulndetector.com`.\n\n## PoC\n\npayloads:\n\n```\nhttp://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\nhttp://vulndetector.com\\\\/\n```\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTML tag scenarios. Below is a poc example. After clicking the button, the browser will open \"browser.check\", and jetty will parse this URL as \"vulndetector.com\".\n\n```\n<a href=\"http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/\"></a>\n```\nA comparison of the parsing differences between Jetty and chrome is shown in the table below (note that neither should accept the URI as valid).\n\n| Invalid URI                                       | Jetty            | Chrome        |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check &@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check #@vulndetector.com/ | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check?@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n| http://browser.check#@vulndetector.com/    | vulndetector.com | browser.check |\n\nThe problem of 302 redirect parsing in HTTP 302 Location\n\n| Input                    | Jetty          | Chrome        |\n| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |\n| http://browser.check%5c/ | browser.check\\ | browser.check |\n\nIt is noteworthy that Spring Web also faced similar security vulnerabilities, being affected by the aforementioned four types of payloads. These issues have since been resolved and have been assigned three CVE numbers [3-5].\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is limited to developers that use the Jetty HttpURI directly.  Example: your project implemented a blocklist to block on some hosts based on HttpURI's handling of authority section.  The vulnerability will help attackers bypass the protections that developers have set up for hosts. The vulnerability will lead to **SSRF**[1] and **URL Redirection**[2] vulnerabilities in several cases. \n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe attacks outlined above rely on decoded user data being passed to the `HttpURI` class. Application should not pass decoded user data as an encoded URI to any URI class/method, including `HttpURI`.  Such applications are likely to be vulnerable in other ways. \nThe immediate solution is to upgrade to a version of the class that will fully validate the characters of the URI authority.  Ultimately, Jetty will deprecate and remove support for user info in the authority per [RFC9110 Section 4.2.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-4.2.4). \n\nNote that the Chrome (and other browsers) parse the invalid user info section improperly as well (due to flawed WhatWG URL parsing rules that do not apply outside of a Web Browser).\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html\n[2] https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html",

      "description": "Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be very slow.  Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.  An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.  When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).  With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.  Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed data.  Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low.  In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.  The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.  In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern, and the severity is therefore considered low.",

Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still insist to use XStream default blacklist - despite that clear recommendation - can use a workaround depending on their version in use.\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 can simply add two lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\n\nUsers of XStream 1.4.14 to 1.4.13 can simply add three lines to XStream's setup code:\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.12 to 1.4.7 who want to use XStream with a black list will have to setup such a list from scratch and deny at least the following types: _javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter_, _java.beans.EventHandler_, _java.lang.ProcessBuilder_, _jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString.class_, _java.lang.Void_ and _void_ and deny several types by name pattern.\n```Java\nxstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" });\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\", java.beans.EventHandler.class, java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.lang.Void.class, void.class });\nxstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\$LazyIterator\", \"javax\\\\.crypto\\\\..*\", \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });\n```\nUsers of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:\n```Java\nxstream.registerConverter(new Converter() {\n  public boolean canConvert(Class type) {\n    return type != null && (type == java.beans.EventHandler.class || type == java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class\n        || type.getName().equals(\"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\") || type.getName().equals(\"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\")\n        || type == java.lang.Void.class || void.class || Proxy.isProxy(type))\n        || type.getName().startsWith(\"javax.crypto.\") || type.getName().endsWith(\"$LazyIterator\") || type.getName().endsWith(\".ReadAllStream$FileStream\"));\n  }\n\n  public Object unmarshal(HierarchicalStreamReader reader, UnmarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n\n  public void marshal(Object source, HierarchicalStreamWriter writer, MarshallingContext context) {\n    throw new ConversionException(\"Unsupported type due to security reasons.\");\n  }\n}, XStream.PRIORITY_LOW);\n```\n  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)",

      "description": "## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack\nThe HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from that TCP connection is processed.\n\nAbuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled, but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open. \n\nThe HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2 attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.\n\nThe ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available network bandwidth.\n\nIn a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable cost asymmetry between the server and the client.\n\nMultiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo advisory and their original conent follows.\n\n## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory\nswift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away, including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward progress.\n\nswift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while constraining malicious actors.",

If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.  The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.  These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.  The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.",

Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname.

      "description": "The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.  The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.    This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.  Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.  The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.",

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox.

      "description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThe PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user.\n\nUser applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted.\n\nUser application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet.\n\nFor example:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE refresh_row_example (\n  id     int PRIMARY KEY,\n  \"1 FROM refresh_row_example; SELECT pg_sleep(10); SELECT * \" int\n);\n```\n\nThis example has a table with two columns. The name of the second column is crafted to contain a statement terminator followed by additional SQL. Invoking the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` on a ResultSet that queried this table, e.g. `SELECT * FROM refresh_row`, would cause the additional SQL commands such as the `SELECT pg_sleep(10)` invocation to be executed.\n\nAs the multi statement command would contain multiple results, it would not be possible for the attacker to get data directly out of this approach as the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method would throw an exception. However, the attacker could execute any arbitrary SQL including inserting the data into another table that could then be read or any other DML / DDL statement.\n\nNote that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, versions 42.2.26, 42.3.7, and 42.4.1 have been released with a fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nCheck that you are not using the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method.\n\nIf you are, ensure that the code that executes that method does not connect to a database that is controlled by an unauthenticated or malicious user. If your application only connects to its own database with a fixed schema with no DDL permissions, then you will not be affected by this vulnerability as it requires a maliciously crafted schema.\n",

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.",

      "description": "Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded \"/\" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification (see below). Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed.\n\nUsers of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath() and getPathInfo() [1].\n\nUsers of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified.\n\nUsers of IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected.\n\nUsers of other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected.\n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25015\n\n## Affected Pivotal Products and Versions\nSeverity is high unless otherwise noted.\n- Spring Security 3.2.0 - 3.2.9\n- Spring Security 4.0.x - 4.1.3\n- Spring Security 4.2.0\n- Older unsupported versions are also affected\n\n## Mitigation\nAdopting one of the following mitigations will protect against this vulnerability.\n\n- Use a Servlet container known not to include path parameters in the return values for getServletPath() and getPathInfo()\n- Upgrading to Spring Security 3.2.10, 4.1.4 or 4.2.1 will reject the request with a RequestRejectedException if the presence of an encoded \"/\" is detected. Note: If you wish to disable this feature it can be disabled by setting the DefaultHttpFirewall.allowUrlEncodedSlash = true. However, disabling this feature will mean applications are vulnerable (in containers that return path parameters in getServletPath() or getPathInfo()).\n\n## Credit\nThe issue was identified by Shumpei Asahara & Yuji Ito from NTT DATA Corporation and responsibly reported to Pivotal.",

      "description": "### Impact\nWhen using SSL/TLS with Jetty, either with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, or WebSocket, the server may receive an invalid large (greater than 17408) TLS frame that is incorrectly handled, causing CPU resources to eventually reach 100% usage.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe problem can be worked around by compiling the following class:\n```java\npackage org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072;\n\nimport java.nio.ByteBuffer;\nimport javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine;\nimport javax.net.ssl.SSLEngineResult;\nimport javax.net.ssl.SSLException;\nimport javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException;\n\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.io.EndPoint;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.io.ssl.SslConnection;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.Connector;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.SslConnectionFactory;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.util.BufferUtil;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.util.annotation.Name;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory;\n\npublic class SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory extends SslConnectionFactory\n{\n    public SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory(@Name(\"sslContextFactory\") SslContextFactory factory, @Name(\"next\") String nextProtocol)\n    {\n        super(factory, nextProtocol);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected SslConnection newSslConnection(Connector connector, EndPoint endPoint, SSLEngine engine)\n    {\n        return new SslConnection(connector.getByteBufferPool(), connector.getExecutor(), endPoint, engine, isDirectBuffersForEncryption(), isDirectBuffersForDecryption())\n        {\n            @Override\n            protected SSLEngineResult unwrap(SSLEngine sslEngine, ByteBuffer input, ByteBuffer output) throws SSLException\n            {\n                SSLEngineResult results = super.unwrap(sslEngine, input, output);\n\n                if ((results.getStatus() == SSLEngineResult.Status.BUFFER_UNDERFLOW ||\n                    results.getStatus() == SSLEngineResult.Status.OK && results.bytesConsumed() == 0 && results.bytesProduced() == 0) &&\n                    BufferUtil.space(input) == 0)\n                {\n                    BufferUtil.clear(input);\n                    throw new SSLHandshakeException(\"Encrypted buffer max length exceeded\");\n                }\n                return results;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class can be deployed by:\n + The resulting class file should be put into a jar file (eg sslfix6072.jar)\n + The jar file should be made available to the server. For a normal distribution this can be done by putting the file into ${jetty.base}/lib\n + Copy the file `${jetty.home}/modules/ssl.mod` to `${jetty.base}/modules`\n + Edit the `${jetty.base}/modules/ssl.mod` file to have the following section:\n\n```\n[lib]\nlib/sslfix6072.jar\n```\n\n+ Copy the file `${jetty.home}/etc/jetty-https.xml` and`${jetty.home}/etc/jetty-http2.xml` to `${jetty.base}/etc`\n+ Edit files `${jetty.base}/etc/jetty-https.xml` and `${jetty.base}/etc/jetty-http2.xml`, changing any reference of `org.eclipse.jetty.server.SslConnectionFactory` to `org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072.SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory`. For example:\n```xml\n  <Call name=\"addIfAbsentConnectionFactory\">\n    <Arg>\n      <New class=\"org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.fix6072.SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory\">\n        <Arg name=\"next\">http/1.1</Arg>\n        <Arg name=\"sslContextFactory\"><Ref refid=\"sslContextFactory\"/></Arg>\n      </New>\n    </Arg>\n  </Call>\n```\n+ Restart Jetty",

      "description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

      "message": "CVE-2023-34455 on org.xerial.snappy/snappy-java@1.1.7.1",
      "description": "## Summary\nDue to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur.\n## Impact\nDenial of Service\n## Description\nThe code in the function [hasNextChunk](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java#L388) in the file [SnappyInputStream.java](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java) checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn’t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\n\n\n```java\n        int readBytes = readNext(header, 0, 4);\n        if (readBytes < 4) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        int chunkSize = SnappyOutputStream.readInt(header, 0);\n        if (chunkSize == SnappyCodec.MAGIC_HEADER_HEAD) {\n            .........\n        }\n\n        // extend the compressed data buffer size\n        if (compressed == null || chunkSize > compressed.length) {\n            compressed = new byte[chunkSize];\n        }\n\n```\n\nIn the case that the “compressed” variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn’t test the legality of the “chunkSize” variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a “java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException” exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal “java.lang.OutOfMemoryError” error.\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\nCompile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        byte[] data = {-126, 'S', 'N', 'A', 'P', 'P', 'Y', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,(byte) 0x7f, (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff};\n        SnappyInputStream in = new SnappyInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));\n        byte[] out = new byte[50];\n        try {\n            in.read(out);\n        }\n        catch (Exception ignored) {\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe program will crash with the following error (or similar), even though there is a catch clause, since “OutOfMemoryError” does not get caught by catching the “Exception” class:\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Requested array size exceeds VM limit\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream.hasNextChunk(SnappyInputStream.java:422)\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream.read(SnappyInputStream.java:167)\n\tat java.base/java.io.InputStream.read(InputStream.java:217)\n\tat org.example.Main.main(Main.java:12)\n\n```\n\n\nAlternatively - compile and run the following code:\n\n```java\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        byte[] data = {-126, 'S', 'N', 'A', 'P', 'P', 'Y', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,(byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff};\n        SnappyInputStream in = new SnappyInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));\n        byte[] out = new byte[50];\n        in.read(out);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe program will crash with the following error (or similar):\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -1\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream.hasNextChunk(SnappyInputStream.java:422)\n\tat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream.read(SnappyInputStream.java:167)\n\tat java.base/java.io.InputStream.read(InputStream.java:217)\n\tat org.example.Main.main(Main.java:12)\n\n```\n\n\nIt is important to note that these examples were written by using a flow that is generally used by developers, and can be seen for example in the Apache project “flume”: https://github.com/apache/flume/blob/f9dbb2de255d59e35e3668a5c6c66a268a055207/flume-ng-channels/flume-file-channel/src/main/java/org/apache/flume/channel/file/Serialization.java#L278. Since they used try-catch, the “NegativeArraySizeException” exception won’t harm their users, but the “OutOfMemoryError” error can.",

      "description": "### Summary\n\nsnappy-java is a data compression library in Java. Its SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too-large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. \n\n### Scope\n\nAll versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3.  A fix is applied in 1.1.10.4\n\n### Details\nWhile performing mitigation efforts related to [CVE-2023-34455](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34455) in Confluent products, our Application Security team closely analyzed the fix that was accepted and merged into snappy-java version 1.1.10.1 in [this](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea) commit. The check on [line 421](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea#diff-c3e53610267092989965e8c7dd2d4417d355ff7f560f9e8075b365f32569079fR421) only attempts to check if chunkSize is not a negative value. We believe that this is an inadequate fix as it misses an upper-bounds check for overly positive values such as 0x7FFFFFFF (or (2,147,483,647 in decimal) before actually [attempting to allocate](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea#diff-c3e53610267092989965e8c7dd2d4417d355ff7f560f9e8075b365f32569079fR429) the provided unverified number of bytes via the “chunkSize” variable. This missing upper-bounds check can lead to the applications depending upon snappy-java to allocate an inappropriate number of bytes on the heap which can then cause an  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception. Under some specific conditions and contexts, this can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack with a direct impact on the availability of the dependent implementations based on the usage of the snappy-java library for compression/decompression needs.\n\n### PoC\nCompile and run the following code:\n```\npackage org.example;\nimport org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream;\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        byte[] data = {-126, 'S', 'N', 'A', 'P', 'P', 'Y', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,(byte) 0x7f, (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff, (byte) 0xff};\n        SnappyInputStream in = new SnappyInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data));\n        byte[] out = new byte[50];\n        try {\n            in.read(out);\n        }\n        catch (Exception ignored) {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\nDenial of Service of applications dependent on snappy-java especially if `ExitOnOutOfMemoryError` or `CrashOnOutOfMemoryError` is configured on the JVM.\n\n### Credits\nJan Werner, Mukul Khullar and Bharadwaj Machiraju from Confluent's Application Security team. \n\nWe kindly request for a new CVE ID to be assigned once you acknowledge this vulnerability.",

      "description": "### Summary\nA denial of service vulnerability in JSON-Java was discovered by [ClusterFuzz](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz/).  A bug in the parser means that an input string of modest size can lead to indefinite amounts of memory being used. There are two issues: (1) the parser bug can be used to circumvent a check that is supposed to prevent the key in a JSON object from itself being another JSON object; (2) if a key does end up being a JSON object then it gets converted into a string, using `\\` to escape special characters, including `\\` itself. So by nesting JSON objects, with a key that is a JSON object that has a key that is a JSON object, and so on, we can get an exponential number of `\\` characters in the escaped string.\n\n### Severity\nHigh - Because this is an already-fixed DoS vulnerability, the only remaining impact possible is for existing binaries that have not been updated yet.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n```java\npackage orgjsonbug;\n\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\n/**\n * Illustrates a bug in JSON-Java.\n */\npublic class Bug {\n  private static String makeNested(int depth) {\n    if (depth == 0) {\n      return \"{\\\"a\\\":1}\";\n    }\n    return \"{\\\"a\\\":1;\\t\\0\" + makeNested(depth - 1) + \":1}\";\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = makeNested(30);\n    System.out.printf(\"Input string has length %d: %s\\n\", input.length(), input);\n    JSONObject output = new JSONObject(input);\n    System.out.printf(\"Output JSONObject has length %d: %s\\n\", output.toString().length(), output);\n  }\n}\n```\nWhen run, this reports that the input string has length 367. Then, after a long pause, the program crashes inside new JSONObject with OutOfMemoryError.\n\n### Further Analysis\nThe issue is fixed by [this PR](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/pull/759).\n\n### Timeline\n**Date reported**: 07/14/2023\n**Date fixed**: \n**Date disclosed**: 10/12/2023",

      "message": "CVE-2022-31159 on com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-s3@1.11.310",
      "description": "### Overview\n\nA partial-path traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of the AWS SDK for Java v1. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory. \n\nThis issue’s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`. \n\nVersions of the AWS Java SDK for S3 v1 before and including v1.12.260 are affected by this issue. \n\n### Impact\n\nIf `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written outside of the intended destination directory.\n\n#### Root Cause\n\nThe `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` contains a partial-path traversal vulnerability.\n\nThis is due to the guard logic in `leavesRoot` containing an insufficient protection against partial-path traversal.\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5be0807af763b9fbf6b0a153c76dd305e407f035/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1513-L1519\n\nThe application controls the `localBaseDirectory` argument, but the `key` comes from the AWS bucket entry (ie. can be attacker controlled). The above bit of logic can be bypassed with the following payloads:\n\n```java\n// The following will return 'false', although the attacker value will \"leave\" the `/usr/foo` directory\nleavesRoot(new File(\"/usr/foo\"), \"/../foo-bar/bar\")\n```\n\nThis guard is used here which should guard against path traversal, however `leavesRoot` is an insufficient guard:\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/ae88c8aa4b195047b94c154897475f85642d7eb3/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1420-L1423\n\n#### True Root cause\n\n If the result of `parent.getCanonicalPath()` is not slash terminated it allows for partial path traversal.\n\n> Consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\")`. The check is bypassed although `outnot` is not under the `out` directory.\nThe terminating slash may be removed in various places. On Linux `println(new File(\"/var/\"))` returns `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\"))` - `/var/`, however `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` - `/var`.\n \\- [@JarLob (Jaroslav Lobačevski)](https://github.com/JarLob)\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the AWS SDK for Java >= 1.12.261, if you are on a version < 1.12.261.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` pass a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey` method return a string containing the substring `..` .\n\n### References\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities:\n - ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23457\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact [AWS's Security team](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n",

      "description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.20 handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. Following types of the Java runtime are affected:\n\n- java.util.HashMap\n- java.util.HashSet\n- java.util.Hashtable\n- java.util.LinkedHashMap\n- java.util.LinkedHashSet\n- Other third party collection implementations that use their element's hash code may also be affected\n\nA simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.\n\nIf your object graph does not use referenced elements at all, you may simply set the NO_REFERENCE mode:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.setMode(XStream.NO_REFERENCES);\n```\n\nIf your object graph contains neither a Hashtable, HashMap nor a HashSet (or one of the linked variants of it) then you can use the security framework to deny the usage of these types:\n```Java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{\n java.util.HashMap.class, java.util.HashSet.class, java.util.Hashtable.class, java.util.LinkedHashMap.class, java.util.LinkedHashSet.class\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately these types are very common. If you only use HashMap or HashSet and your XML refers these only as default map or set, you may additionally change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util.Set at unmarshalling time::\n```Java\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeMap.class, java.util.Map.class);\nxstream.addDefaultImplementation(java.util.TreeSet.class, java.util.Set.class);\n```\nHowever, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2022-41966](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n",

Parsing nested groups as unknown fields with DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser, or against Protobuf map fields, creates unbounded recursions that can be abused by an attacker.\n\n### Proof of Concept\nFor reproduction details, please refer to the unit tests (Protobuf Java [LiteTest](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/a037f28ff81ee45ebe008c64ab632bf5372242ce/java/lite/src/test/java/com/google/protobuf/LiteTest.java) and [CodedInputStreamTest](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/a037f28ff81ee45ebe008c64ab632bf5372242ce/java/core/src/test/java/com/google/protobuf/CodedInputStreamTest.java)) that identify the specific inputs that exercise this parsing weakness.\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\nWe have been working diligently to address this issue and have released a mitigation that is available now. Please update to the latest available versions of the following packages:\n* protobuf-java (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)\n* protobuf-javalite (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)\n* protobuf-kotlin (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)\n* protobuf-kotlin-lite (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)\n* com-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)",

      "description": "When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.",

      "description": "Spring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. \n\n## Impact\n\nA Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).",

      "description": "# Impact\nSQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code that has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default query mode. Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\n# Exploitation\n\nTo exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus (i.e. `-`)\n1. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder on the same line. \n1. Both parameters must be user controlled.\n\nThe prior behavior of the driver when operating in simple query mode would inline the negative value of the first parameter and cause the resulting line to be treated as a `--` SQL comment. That would extend to the beginning of the next parameter and cause the quoting of that parameter to be consumed by the comment line. If that string parameter includes a newline, the resulting text would appear unescaped in the resulting SQL.\n\nWhen operating in the default extended query mode this would not be an issue as the parameter values are sent separately to the server. Only in simple query mode the parameter values are inlined into the executed SQL causing this issue.\n\n# Example\n\n```java\nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT -?, ?\");\nstmt.setInt(1, -1);\nstmt.setString(2, \"\\nWHERE false --\");\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n```\n\nThe resulting SQL when operating in simple query mode would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT --1,'\nWHERE false --'\n```\n\nThe contents of the second parameter get injected into the command. Note how both the number of result columns and the WHERE clause of the command have changed. A more elaborate example could execute arbitrary other SQL commands.\n\n# Patch\nProblem will be patched upgrade to 42.7.2, 42.6.1, 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, 42.2.28, 42.2.28.jre7\n\nThe patch fixes the inlining of parameters by forcing them all to be serialized as wrapped literals. The SQL in the prior example would be transformed into:\n\n```sql\nSELECT -('-1'::int4), ('\nWHERE false --')\n```\n\n# Workarounds\nDo not use the connection property`preferQueryMode=simple`. (*NOTE: If you do not explicitly specify a query mode then you are using the default of `extended` and are not impacted by this issue.*)",
