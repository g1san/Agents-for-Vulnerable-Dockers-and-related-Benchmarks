    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201125646 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Druid. The flaw resides in the indexing sampler API (POST /druid/indexer/v1/sampler) and other query endpoints that accept a JavaScript\u2011based filter. When a crafted JSON payload supplies a JavaScript function that calls java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(), Druid evaluates the function with the Nashorn engine and executes the supplied operating\u2011system command. Because the sampler endpoint is typically unauthenticated and exposed on the Druid HTTP API, an attacker can send the malicious request and obtain a reverse shell or run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Druid process, leading to full compromise of the host.",
