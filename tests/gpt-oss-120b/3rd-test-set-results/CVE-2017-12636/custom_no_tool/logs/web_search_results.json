    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201112636 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache CouchDB. The flaw resides in CouchDB's handling of configuration and user documents. When an administrative user (or, in some cases, an unauthenticated attacker) provides crafted JSON data through the HTTP API, CouchDB can be tricked into executing arbitrary operating\u2011system commands. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the CouchDB HTTP endpoint (default port 5984) that either sets a server configuration option pointing to a malicious executable or creates a user document with duplicate \\\"roles\\\" keys that grant administrative privileges. Once the attacker obtains administrative rights, CouchDB launches the supplied binaries as the CouchDB system user, giving the attacker full control of the host. The issue affects all CouchDB releases prior to the security patches released in version 1.7.1 and version 2.1.1. Exploitation does not require any additional services beyond the vulnerable CouchDB instance itself; the attacker only needs network access to the CouchDB HTTP API.",
