Instructions:
1. Ensure Docker is installed on the host.
2. Navigate to this directory.
3. Run `docker compose up --build -d`.

The compose file starts five services:
- `vulnerable`: a Docker-in-Docker container representing a vulnerable Docker Engine.
- `malicious_server`: serves the malicious Docker image tarball over HTTP on port 8000.
- `victim`: uses a lightweight Alpine image, fetches the malicious tarball from `malicious_server`, but skips the `docker load` step because the placeholder is not a valid image. It then sleeps indefinitely.
- `couchdb`: runs Apache CouchDB version 1.6.5, which is vulnerable to CVE‑2017‑12636. The service is exposed on port 5984.
- `couchdb_init`: runs once to create a test database (`testdb`) and a sample document (`doc1`). It then stays alive so the container remains running.

If you want to test the full exploit flow, replace `malicious_server/malicious.tar` with a real Docker image tarball created via `docker save`. The `victim` service will then automatically load and run it.

All services are automatically built and started; no manual setup is required.
