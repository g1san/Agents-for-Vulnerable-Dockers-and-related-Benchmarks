    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201118349 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Alibaba Fastjson library. The library\u2019s parseObject method (versions lower than 1.2.25) trusts the \"@type\" attribute in JSON input. An attacker can supply the class name com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl together with a malicious JNDI URL (e.g., rmi://attacker:9999/ExploitClass). When Fastjson deserializes the payload it instantiates JdbcRowSetImpl, which performs a JNDI lookup, loads the attacker\u2011controlled class, and executes the static initializer of that class. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the host process with the privileges of the vulnerable Java application, resulting in full system compromise.",
