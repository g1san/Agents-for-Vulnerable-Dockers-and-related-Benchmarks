    "desc": "CVE-2017-1000353 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Jenkins. The original remoting\u2011based Jenkins command line interface (CLI) accepted a serialized java.security.SignedObject from an attacker. Because the CLI deserialized this object with a plain ObjectInputStream, the normal blocklist of dangerous classes was bypassed. An attacker can therefore send a crafted SignedObject to the CLI endpoint (http(s)://<host>:8080/cli) and achieve arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins controller with the privileges of the Jenkins process. The flaw existed in Jenkins core versions prior to 2.107 (weekly) and 2.60.3 (LTS), and specifically in the CLI of Jenkins 2.56 and earlier (LTS 2.46.1 and earlier). The issue was fixed by adding SignedObject to the blocklist, deprecating the remoting\u2011based CLI, and shipping an HTTP\u2011based CLI as the default. Updating to Jenkins 2.107 (or later) or LTS 2.60.3 (or later) resolves the vulnerability.",
