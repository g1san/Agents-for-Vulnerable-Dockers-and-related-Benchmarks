    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20119086 is a directory\u2011traversal / symlink\u2011based arbitrary file read vulnerability in GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. The flaw resides in the project import/export feature introduced in GitLab 8.9. During import the server extracts the uploaded tar.gz archive without sanitising symbolic links. An attacker who is an authenticated user can craft an archive that contains a symlink (e.g., pointing to /etc/passwd) and place it in the location of the `VERSION` or `project.json` files. When the import routine reads these files it follows the symlink, reads the target file and returns its content in an error response, allowing the attacker to read any file readable by the GitLab service account. The vulnerability affects GitLab versions 8.9.0\u20118.9.11, 8.10.0\u20118.10.12, 8.11.0\u20118.11.9, 8.12.0\u20118.12.7, and 8.13.0\u20118.13.2. It was originally restricted to administrators until version 8.13.0, after which it became accessible to all authenticated users. Exploitation can expose configuration files, secret tokens, or any other sensitive data, potentially leading to credential theft and further compromise of the GitLab instance.",
