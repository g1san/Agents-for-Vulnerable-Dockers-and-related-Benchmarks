    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20119993 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework. When processing HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlists, FFmpeg fails to properly restrict the allowed filename extensions and demuxer names. An attacker can embed a crafted playlist entry that references an arbitrary file on the host (for example using a file:// URI or a path traversal). Because FFmpeg accepts the filename unchecked, it reads the file\u2019s contents and includes them in the generated HLS output. This results in unauthorized disclosure of any readable file on the system running the vulnerable FFmpeg binary. No code execution is required; the flaw is exploitable simply by delivering a malicious HLS playlist to a vulnerable FFmpeg instance.",
