    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20116920 is a high\u2011severity remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal Core 8. The flaw resides in the built\u2011in YAML parser used for configuration import. When the PECL yaml PHP extension is installed and the directive yaml.decode_php is enabled, Drupal improperly handles YAML tags that allow deserialization of arbitrary PHP objects. An attacker who can supply a crafted YAML document (for example via the Single configuration import UI at /admin/config/development/configuration/single/import) can cause Drupal to unserialize a malicious PHP object. The object's magic methods are then executed, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary PHP code on the server with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. The vulnerability affects all Drupal 8 releases earlier than 8.3.4. It can be exploited without any authentication if the vulnerable endpoint is reachable, leading to full site compromise, web\u2011shell upload, data theft, and defacement.",
