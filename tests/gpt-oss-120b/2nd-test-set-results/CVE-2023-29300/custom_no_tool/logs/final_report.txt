CVE description: CVE‑2023‑29300 is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the Web Distributed Data eXchange (WDDX) deserialization routine that processes arguments supplied to ColdFusion Component (CFC) endpoints. When a crafted WDDX packet contains a <struct> element with a malicious type attribute, the deserializer creates and instantiates a Java class via reflection. Because the built‑in deny‑list is insufficient, an attacker can supply a gadget such as com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl that triggers a JNDI lookup, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server. The vulnerability bypasses any authentication checks and can be used to install web‑shells, run system commands, or further compromise the host. Affected installations are all supported ColdFusion 2018, 2021, and 2023 versions that have not been updated beyond the listed baseline releases. The official Adobe security update APSB23‑40 (ColdFusion 2018 Update 17, ColdFusion 2021 Update 7, ColdFusion 2023 Update 1) resolves the issue, and applying the matching JDK/LTS version is also required.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition only includes a MySQL 5.7 service and a PHP 7.4‑Apache application. No Adobe ColdFusion image is used, and no OpenJDK image is present. Consequently, the required services (adobe/coldfusion and openjdk) are missing, and there is no ColdFusion version to compare against the allowed list, causing both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition only includes a MySQL 5.7 service and a PHP 7.4‑Apache application. No Adobe ColdFusion image is used, and no OpenJDK image is present. Consequently, the required services (adobe/coldfusion and openjdk) are missing, and there is no ColdFusion version to compare against the allowed list, causing both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: Add a ColdFusion service based on an official adobe/coldfusion image that matches one of the patched versions (for example adobe/coldfusion:2023‑update‑1 or adobe/coldfusion:2021‑update‑7), and ensure it runs on a compatible OpenJDK base (the ColdFusion image already includes the required JDK, so a separate openjdk container is not needed). In docker‑compose.yml declare the new coldfusion service, expose its HTTP port, and link it to the existing MySQL service with environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_USER, etc.) so the PHP app can still reach the database. Finally, remove the “custom_no_tool” label and rebuild the stack so the composition contains both adobe/coldfusion and the MySQL service, satisfying the required milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the php:7.4‑apache base does not contain the build tools required to compile the mysqli extension; you need to update the Dockerfile to install the necessary packages (e.g., apt‑get update and apt‑get install -y libmariadb-dev default‑mysql‑client or default‑libmysqlclient‑dev plus build‑essential and php‑dev) before running docker-php-ext-install mysqli, then clean up the apt cache. Adding a RUN apt‑get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* after the install will keep the image small. With those changes the PHP container will compile the extension successfully and the compose stack will start.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile is using the now‑obsolete php:7.4‑apache image, which can no longer be pulled from Docker Hub; switching to a supported tag (for example php:8.1‑apache) resolves the pull error and also gives you a newer, compatible Debian base that still provides the docker‑php‑ext‑install helper. After changing the first line to FROM php:8.1‑apache, keep the apt‑get update/install block (adding libzip-dev only if you need the zip extension) and run docker-php-ext-install mysqli as before; the rest of the Dockerfile (COPY src/ … and EXPOSE 80) works unchanged and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to compile the mysqli extension from source even though the official php:8.1‑apache image already ships with it, and the default‑libmysqlclient‑dev package that the script asks for isn’t available in the base Debian repository used by that image. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile so it no longer attempts to install default‑libmysqlclient‑dev or run docker‑php‑ext‑install for mysqli. Instead, just install the other required libraries (e.g., libzip‑dev and zlib1g‑dev if you need zip support) and copy the application files. After removing the unnecessary apt‑get line and the docker‑php‑ext‑install command, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image never installs the native MySQLi extension that the script expects, and the copy step can’t find the source files unless the build context is set correctly; to fix it, change the Dockerfile so it starts from the same directory that contains the src folder (keeping build: ./app as is), add the PHP MySQLi extension with docker-php-ext-install mysqli (and optionally zip with docker-php-ext-install zip if you need it), and clean up the apt cache afterward; the resulting Dockerfile will look like:

```
FROM php:8.1-apache
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libzip-dev zlib1g-dev && \
    docker-php-ext-install mysqli zip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY src/ /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
```

With the MySQLi extension installed, the PHP container can connect to the database and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP image can’t compile the mysqli and zip extensions – the required native libraries aren’t present – and the ColdFusion container name you’re pulling doesn’t exist in Docker Hub, so Docker can’t download the image. To fix it, change the coldfusion service to use a valid tag (for example adobe/coldfusion:2023‑update‑1‑latest or whichever exact tag Adobe publishes) and extend the PHP Dockerfile to install the missing development packages before running docker‑php‑ext‑install. In practice you would add default‑mysql‑client and libzip‑dev (and any other headers such as zlib1g‑dev or libpng‑dev if required) to the apt‑get install line, then run the extension installer, and finally clean up the apt cache. Once those packages are installed and the correct ColdFusion image name is used, the build will complete successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Docker can’t locate a valid ColdFusion image – the tag “2023‑update‑1‑latest” isn’t published on Docker Hub, so the compose parser aborts before it ever gets to the PHP service. Change the coldfusion service’s image line to a tag that actually exists (for example adobe/coldfusion:2023‑update‑1 or the exact version you’ve verified locally). Once the ColdFusion image resolves, the PHP Dockerfile will build correctly; the rest of the compose file already points to the proper build context (app/Dockerfile) and copies the src folder, so no further changes are needed.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image is trying to compile the zip extension without having the necessary development libraries and configuration flags, so the zip extension compilation aborts and the whole Dockerfile stops. Fix it by extending the Dockerfile to install the libzip‑dev (and its build dependencies such as zlib1g-dev) and then run docker‑php‑ext‑configure zip --with‑libzip before invoking docker‑php‑ext‑install zip; you can also add libpng‑dev if required for other extensions. After the apt‑get line, insert a line like docker-php-ext-configure zip --with-libzip and then keep the existing docker-php-ext-install mysqli zip command. Finally, verify that the COPY src/ /var/www/html/ statement points to the correct relative directory (the src folder must exist next to the Dockerfile) so the build context includes the application files. Once these changes are made the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails while building because the PHP mysqli extension can’t be compiled – the MySQL development headers aren’t installed. In the Dockerfile add the MySQL client development package (e.g. `default-libmysqlclient-dev` or `mysql-client` depending on the base distro) before running `docker-php-ext-install`, and then clean the apt cache. After that the `docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli zip` step will succeed and the image will build correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
