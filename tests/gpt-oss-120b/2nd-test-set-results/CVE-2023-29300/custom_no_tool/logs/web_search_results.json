    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201129300 is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the Web Distributed Data eXchange (WDDX) deserialization routine that processes arguments supplied to ColdFusion Component (CFC) endpoints. When a crafted WDDX packet contains a <struct> element with a malicious type attribute, the deserializer creates and instantiates a Java class via reflection. Because the built\u2011in deny\u2011list is insufficient, an attacker can supply a gadget such as com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl that triggers a JNDI lookup, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server. The vulnerability bypasses any authentication checks and can be used to install web\u2011shells, run system commands, or further compromise the host. Affected installations are all supported ColdFusion 2018, 2021, and 2023 versions that have not been updated beyond the listed baseline releases. The official Adobe security update APSB23\u201140 (ColdFusion 2018 Update\u202f17, ColdFusion 2021 Update\u202f7, ColdFusion 2023 Update\u202f1) resolves the issue, and applying the matching JDK/LTS version is also required.",
