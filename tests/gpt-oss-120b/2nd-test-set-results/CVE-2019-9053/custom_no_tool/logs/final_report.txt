CVE description: CVE‑2019‑9053 is a vulnerability in the CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) web application. Versions of CMSMS up to and including 2.2.9 contain a flaw in the handling of user‑supplied input (specifically the `m1_idlist` parameter in the News module). The application concatenates this input directly into an SQL query without proper sanitisation or type‑checking. An attacker can craft a request that injects arbitrary SQL code, bypassing the integer cast by providing a leading comma so the last element of the list is not filtered. The injected payload can close the intended IN clause and execute a time‑based blind SQL injection (for example using `sleep(5)`). By measuring the response delay, the attacker can infer Boolean conditions and iteratively extract data from the database, such as the administrator username and password hash stored in the `cms_user` table. This unauthenticated exploitation grants full compromise of the CMS installation, allowing data theft, defacement, and eventual remote code execution.
Attack Type: unauthenticated blind time based SQL injection

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the Flask service tries to talk to the Docker‑in‑Docker daemon as soon as it starts, but the `docker:18.09.5-dind` container isn’t fully up yet, so the client can’t connect and the request fails. Fix it by adding a small start‑up guard in the Flask app: before creating the Docker client, poll the `http://vulnerable-docker:2375/_ping` endpoint in a loop (with a short sleep) until it returns “OK”, then call `docker.from_env()`. That guarantees the daemon is ready before any containers are launched and eliminates the startup race condition causing the container to appear broken. No other code changes are required.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The test app is trying to connect to the Docker daemon before the daemon’s TCP listener is actually reachable, and the default docker.from_env() call also looks for the Unix socket, which doesn’t exist inside the container. Change the client creation to use an explicit TCP endpoint—e.g., replace client = docker.from_env() with client = docker.DockerClient(base_url='http://vulnerable-docker:2375')—and after client.containers.run add cont.wait() so the container finishes before you pull its logs; this ensures the app can reliably start the daemon‑side container and return its output.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that test‑app tries to talk to the Docker daemon before it is fully up, so the HTTP / _ping check never succeeds and the client is created with a dead endpoint; the container then crashes when it reaches client.containers.run. The fix is to make the start‑up guard more tolerant and to give Docker enough time to initialize: increase the timeout in the urlopen call (for example to 5 seconds) and add a short sleep after the ping succeeds before creating the DockerClient. Also catch the specific docker.errors.DockerException when the client is instantiated and retry until the daemon is reachable. With these small changes the Flask app will wait for the DIND service to be ready, connect successfully, and the /run endpoint will work again.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the Flask app tries to talk to the Docker daemon before the daemon is fully initialized, so the `client = docker.DockerClient(...)` line often raises a connection‑refused error and the service crashes. Fix it by moving the client creation inside the request handler (or by adding a short retry loop with a timeout) and by specifying `version='auto'` so the client automatically negotiates the API version; this ensures the client is only built once the daemon is live and avoids version mismatches. After that the `/run` endpoint will be able to start and wait for containers without the startup race condition.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common cause for the test‑app container to stay stuck is that it tries to talk to the DIND daemon before the daemon is fully initialized; the simple loop that polls “/_ping” can return a false positive if the daemon is still starting up but not yet ready to accept API calls. Add an explicit healthcheck to the vulnerable‑docker service (for example, `test: ["curl", "-f", "http://localhost:2375/_ping"]` with `interval:5s`, `retries:5`) and change the depends_on definition in the compose file to use `condition: service_healthy`. Then remove the custom wait_for_docker function (or keep it as a fallback) and let Docker Compose guarantee that the daemon is reachable before the Flask app starts handling requests. This eliminates the race condition and allows the /run endpoint to create containers correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the test‑app never starts is that the vulnerable‑docker service fails its healthcheck, because the docker:18.09.5‑dind image does not contain curl by default, so the command `["CMD","curl","-f","http://localhost:2375/_ping"]` always returns an error and marks the container unhealthy. Replace the healthcheck with a command that is guaranteed to exist in the image, for example `["CMD","docker","info"]` (the Docker client is already installed in the DIND image) or install curl in the service’s Dockerfile. After correcting the healthcheck, test‑app will be able to reach the Docker daemon, and the /run endpoint will work as expected.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Docker‑in‑Docker (dind) service is started with the default entrypoint that expects the Docker daemon to run as PID 1, but the compose file also sets a healthcheck that invokes the Docker CLI before the daemon is fully ready, causing a race condition. Change the healthcheck to query the daemon’s Unix socket instead of using the Docker client binary (for example test ["CMD‑SHELL","curl -s http://localhost:2375/_ping | grep OK"] ) and add a short initial delay (start_period) so the daemon has time to start. In the Python app, replace the eager `wait_for_docker()` call with a simple retry loop that only begins after the container reports healthy, or remove the call entirely and rely on the Compose dependency. Finally, ensure the Dockerfile for the test app installs any missing system libraries (e.g., `apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca‑certificates`) before pip installs, because the slim base image may lack required certificates and cause pip to fail. With these adjustments the image builds and the service starts without terminating.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install the Python packages before the source files (including `requirements.txt`) are actually in the image, so the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step can’t find the file. Move the `COPY requirements.txt .` (or copy the whole application directory) to a step that occurs after the base image is prepared and before running `pip install`, and make sure you reference the correct path when installing. A minimal fix is to change the Dockerfile to first copy the entire app directory (or at least the `requirements.txt` file) into `/app`, then run the `apt-get` update, install `ca‑certificates`, and finally execute `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`. This ensures the required files exist when pip runs and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the slim Python image doesn’t contain the native‑toolchain libraries needed to compile some of the wheels listed in requirements.txt (for example cryptography, lxml or other C extensions). To fix it, edit the Dockerfile so that after the apt‑get update you also install the compilation packages (e.g. build‑essential, gcc, musl-dev, libffi-dev, python3‑dev and any other headers required by the Python dependencies), run the pip install step, and then clean the packages away in the same layer to keep the image small. Adding those extra apt‑get install commands before the pip install line will allow the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
