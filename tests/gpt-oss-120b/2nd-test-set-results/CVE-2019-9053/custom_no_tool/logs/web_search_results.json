    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20119053 is a vulnerability in the CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) web application. Versions of CMSMS up to and including 2.2.9 contain a flaw in the handling of user\u2011supplied input (specifically the `m1_idlist` parameter in the News module). The application concatenates this input directly into an SQL query without proper sanitisation or type\u2011checking. An attacker can craft a request that injects arbitrary SQL code, bypassing the integer cast by providing a leading comma so the last element of the list is not filtered. The injected payload can close the intended IN clause and execute a time\u2011based blind SQL injection (for example using `sleep(5)`). By measuring the response delay, the attacker can infer Boolean conditions and iteratively extract data from the database, such as the administrator username and password hash stored in the `cms_user` table. This unauthenticated exploitation grants full compromise of the CMS installation, allowing data theft, defacement, and eventual remote code execution.",
