CVE description: CVE‑2017‑12149 is a critical insecure‑deserialization vulnerability in JBoss Application Server (also known as WildFly) and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.x. The flaw resides in the HTTP invoker / JMX invoker servlet (e.g., /invoker/JMXInvokerServlet) and the ReadOnlyAccessFilter used by the HTTP‑invoker service. The server deserializes attacker‑controlled Java objects without validation, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to supply a malicious serialized payload (commonly generated with ysoserial). When the payload is processed, arbitrary Java code is executed with the privileges of the JBoss process, leading to full remote code execution on the host.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jboss/wildfly][['7.0.0.Final', '7.1.0.Final', '8.0.0.Final', '9.0.0.Final', '10.0.0.Final']] JBoss Application Server / WildFly image that contains the vulnerable HTTP/JMX invoker servlet and deserialization filter. These versions expose the insecure deserialization endpoint required for CVE‑2017‑12149.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines a web service based on php:5.6-apache and a db service based on mysql:5.7. No jboss/wildfly image is referenced in either the Dockerfile or the compose configuration, so the required service is not present (services_ok = false) and consequently no vulnerable WildFly version can be detected (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The compose file defines a web service based on php:5.6-apache and a db service based on mysql:5.7. No jboss/wildfly image is referenced in either the Dockerfile or the compose configuration, so the required service is not present (services_ok = false) and consequently no vulnerable WildFly version can be detected (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: Add a new service to the compose file that runs the vulnerable WildFly image (for example image: jboss/wildfly:7.1.0.Final), expose the HTTP port the JMXInvokerServlet listens on (typically 8080) and place it on the same vulnnet network. Remove the PHP‑based web service or rename it if you still need it for other tests, but ensure the WildFly container is the one referenced by the web service definition. Update the depends_on section so any ancillary containers (such as the MySQL db) are started before WildFly if needed, and adjust any environment variables required by WildFly (e.g., JAVA_OPTS) to keep the default insecure configuration. After adding the WildFly service, the compose file will contain both the vulnerable JBoss/WildFly container and the database, allowing detection of the CVE‑2017‑12149 vulnerable version.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP‑5.6‑apache base image does not have the build tools and MySQL client libraries required to compile the mysqli extension, so the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` step aborts. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to first install the necessary OS packages (e.g., `default-mysql-client` or `libmariadb-dev` together with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev`) and the compiler utilities (`apt-get install -y build‑essential`), then run the extension installer, and finally clean up the apt cache to keep the image small. Also make sure the `COPY src/ /var/www/html/` line points to the correct relative directory (the Docker context must contain the `src` folder at the same level as the Dockerfile). After adding the `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libmariadb-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` sequence, the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP 5.6 Apache image you are using is based on an old Debian snapshot whose package repositories have been removed, so the `apt‑get update && apt‑get install …` step can’t resolve any of the requested libraries. Switch the base image to a still‑supported variant (for example `php:5.6-apache-buster` or `php:5.6-apache-stretch`) and adjust the JPEG development package name to the one that exists in that release (`libjpeg62-turbo-dev` instead of `libjpeg-dev`). After updating the `FROM` line and the package list, the `docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli` command will run without error and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP‑5.6‑apache‑buster image does not have the development headers that `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` needs, and the package name for the JPEG library in Buster is different from the one you specified. Edit the Dockerfile so that the `apt‑get install` line pulls `default-libmysqlclient-dev` (or `libmariadbclient-dev`) together with `libjpeg-dev` (instead of `libjpeg62-turbo-dev`) and any other required dependencies, then run `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` as before and clean up the apt cache. With the correct development packages present, the image will compile successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP‑5.6‑apache‑stretch base image no longer provides the legacy “default‑mysql‑client” and “default‑libmysqlclient‑dev” packages, so the apt‑get line aborts before the extensions are compiled. To fix it, replace those two obsolete package names with the current equivalents (for example “default-mysql-client” → “default-mysql-client-core” or simply “mysql-client” and “default-libmysqlclient-dev” → “libmariadbclient-dev”). After updating the package list, run the install command again and then compile the mysqli extension as before. Once the correct packages are installed, the Dockerfile will finish successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑5.6‑apache‑buster image does not contain the package libmariadbclient-dev, so the apt‑get install step aborts; replace that package with one that actually exists (for example libmysqlclient-dev or simply rely on the already‑installed default‑mysql‑client) and optionally drop it entirely if you only need mysqli, which is provided by the php‑extension installer. Updating the Dockerfile’s RUN line to install only the required graphics libraries (libpng-dev libjpeg62‑turbo-dev libfreetype6-dev) and then run docker-php-ext-install mysqli (and gd if needed) will let the image build successfully. After the change the rest of the compose file can stay unchanged.
