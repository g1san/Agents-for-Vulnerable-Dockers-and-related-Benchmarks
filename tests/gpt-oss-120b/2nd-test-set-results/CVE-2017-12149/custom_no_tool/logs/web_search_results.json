    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201112149 is a critical insecure\u2011deserialization vulnerability in JBoss Application Server (also known as WildFly) and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.x. The flaw resides in the HTTP invoker / JMX invoker servlet (e.g., /invoker/JMXInvokerServlet) and the ReadOnlyAccessFilter used by the HTTP\u2011invoker service. The server deserializes attacker\u2011controlled Java objects without validation, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to supply a malicious serialized payload (commonly generated with ysoserial). When the payload is processed, arbitrary Java code is executed with the privileges of the JBoss process, leading to full remote code execution on the host.",
