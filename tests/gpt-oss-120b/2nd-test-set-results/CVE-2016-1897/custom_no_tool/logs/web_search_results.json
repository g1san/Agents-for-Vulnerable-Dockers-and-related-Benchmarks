    "desc": "CVE-2016-1897 is a heap\u2011based buffer overflow in the libavcodec library of FFmpeg. The vulnerability exists in FFmpeg versions prior to 2.8.13, 3.0.8, and 3.2.3. When FFmpeg (or tools that use it such as ffprobe) decodes specially crafted video streams\u2014such as malformed MPEG\u20114, H.264, or other supported codecs\u2014the decoder fails to validate size fields correctly, leading to an out\u2011of\u2011bounds write in heap memory. An attacker can supply a malicious video file to any application that invokes FFmpeg to probe or process video metadata. The overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process that runs FFmpeg, resulting in remote code execution, denial of service, or a sandbox escape on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems that contain a vulnerable FFmpeg library.",
