    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201135042 is a vulnerability in the GeoServer Web Processing Service (WPS) component. When the WPS Execute operation receives a request containing a Jiffle script or a wps:LiteralData element, GeoServer passes the supplied content to the Janino compiler which generates Java code that is executed without sandboxing. An attacker can embed arbitrary Java code (for example, a call to java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()) in the script, causing the compiled code to be executed on the host. This results in remote code execution with the privileges of the GeoServer process. The flaw is present in GeoServer versions prior to the patches released in 2022\u20112023 and can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /geoserver/wps endpoint. No authentication or additional services are required to exploit the vulnerability.",
