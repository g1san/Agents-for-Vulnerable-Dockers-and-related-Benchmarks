CVE description: CVE‑2023‑35042 is a vulnerability in the GeoServer Web Processing Service (WPS) component. When the WPS Execute operation receives a request containing a Jiffle script or a wps:LiteralData element, GeoServer passes the supplied content to the Janino compiler which generates Java code that is executed without sandboxing. An attacker can embed arbitrary Java code (for example, a call to java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()) in the script, causing the compiled code to be executed on the host. This results in remote code execution with the privileges of the GeoServer process. The flaw is present in GeoServer versions prior to the patches released in 2022‑2023 and can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /geoserver/wps endpoint. No authentication or additional services are required to exploit the vulnerability.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][geoserver/geoserver][['2.18.0', '2.18.1', '2.18.2', '2.18.3', '2.18.4', '2.18.5', '2.19.0', '2.19.1', '2.19.2', '2.19.3', '2.19.4', '2.19.5', '2.20.0', '2.20.1', '2.20.2', '2.20.3']] GeoServer with the WPS extension enabled; this service contains the vulnerable Jiffle processing and Janino compilation path that allows arbitrary code execution.

	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The app container is likely failing because it tries to open the MySQL connection before the database service is fully initialized; to fix this, add a small “wait‑for‑db” script (or use an existing tool such as wait‑for‑it) that loops on `mysql -h db -u root -pexample -e "SELECT 1"` until it succeeds and then starts `node server.js`. You can embed the script in the app Dockerfile (copy it in, make it executable) and change the CMD to run the script instead of launching the server directly. In the docker‑compose.yml replace the plain depends_on with a healthcheck for the db service (for example, `healthcheck: test: ["CMD","mysqladmin","ping","-h","localhost"]...`) and set `depends_on: db: condition: service_healthy` so Docker waits for the database to be ready. Finally, ensure the MySQL image version matches the client library (MySQL 5.7 works with mysql2 2.3.3, but you can also switch to a newer stable MySQL 8.0 image) and confirm the environment variables are correctly passed; after these changes the containers should start cleanly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only two services: 'app' (built from a custom Node image) and 'db' (using mysql:5.7). No service uses the image geoserver/geoserver, so the required service list ['geoserver/geoserver'] is not present, causing the services_ok milestone to fail. Consequently, there is also no use of any geoserver/geoserver version, vulnerable or otherwise, so the code_hard_version milestone is false.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only two services: 'app' (built from a custom Node image) and 'db' (using mysql:5.7). No service uses the image geoserver/geoserver, so the required service list ['geoserver/geoserver'] is not present, causing the services_ok milestone to fail. Consequently, there is also no use of any geoserver/geoserver version, vulnerable or otherwise, so the code_hard_version milestone is false.
	- FIX: Add a service that runs the official geoserver/geoserver image (selecting a version that includes the vulnerable WPS component, such as 2.19.4 or 2.20.2) to the docker‑compose.yml file, and remove or rename the existing app service if it is not needed for the demonstration. Configure the Geoserver service to expose port 8080 (or another host port) and set any required environment variables (e.g., GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR) so the container starts correctly, then adjust any dependent services to point to this Geoserver endpoint. With the Geoserver container present, the required geoserver/geoserver service will be detected and the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones will succeed.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Alpine‑based Node image does not include the native compilation toolchain required by the mysql2 module, so npm install cannot compile the dependency. To fix it, edit the app/Dockerfile to install the build tools before running npm install (e.g., add apk add --no-cache make gcc g++ python3 or the build-base meta‑package), then run the npm install step, and optionally remove the build tools afterwards to keep the image lean. After adding those packages the Dockerfile will build successfully and the service will start as expected.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Node‑alpine image can’t compile the native mysql2 module with the current package list – the Alpine packages required for a C/C++ toolchain and Python aren’t all pulled in, and the MySQL client binary isn’t in the default $PATH when the script later runs. Fix it by simplifying the Dockerfile to install the exact Alpine packages that provide gcc, g++, make, python3 and the mariadb client (e.g. `apk add --no-cache mariadb-connector-c-dev gcc g++ make python3`), then run the npm install, and finally copy the whole app directory (including `wait‑for‑db.sh`) before setting the executable flag. Also adjust the compose file so the init.sql mount uses a path that exists relative to the compose file (e.g. `./db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`). After these changes the image builds without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Node image does not provide all the native build tools needed by the mysql2 module – the compiler cannot find the MySQL client headers and the Python runtime required by node‑gyp. Replace the Alpine base with the regular Debian‑based Node image (or add the missing development packages such as musl‑dev, libc‑dev and the appropriate client‑dev library) and keep only the packages that are actually required. For example, change the first line of the Dockerfile to `FROM node:14` (and drop the `apk add …` line), or if you stay on Alpine add `apk add --no-cache python3 make gcc g++ mariadb-connector-c-dev musl-dev`. After that the `npm install` step will compile mysql2 successfully and the image will build.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the **app** container tries to run the `mysql` client in `wait‑for‑db.sh`, but the `node:14` image only contains the Node runtime and not the MySQL client utilities, so the script aborts with “command not found”. Add the MySQL client to the image – for example, extend the Dockerfile’s `apt‑get install` line to also install `default-mysql-client` (or `mysql-client`) – then rebuild. This gives the script the `mysql` binary it needs, allows the health‑check loop to succeed, and the image will compile without errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install a package that isn’t available in the default node:14 image and then sets the script executable before it’s actually copied into the image. Switch the base image to a Debian‑based tag that has the MySQL client (for example node:14‑buster) and move the COPY . . step before the chmod so the script exists when the permission is set; you can also replace default‑mysql‑client with the explicit package name mysql‑client to guarantee it resolves. After those two changes the image should build successfully and the container will be able to wait for MySQL before starting the Node app.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Debian‑based node:14‑buster image does not provide the “mysql‑client” package name you’re asking for – the correct package is default‑mysql‑client (or mariadb‑client), and pulling in the full gcc/g++ toolchain is unnecessary for this app. Edit the Dockerfile so the apt line reads `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y default‑mysql‑client && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, then keep the existing copy of the source, set the execute bit on wait‑for‑db.sh, and keep the final `CMD ["sh","./wait-for-db.sh"]`. After that the image builds cleanly and the container can start the Node server once MySQL is reachable.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install a package that isn’t available in the Debian buster base used by the node 14 image; swapping `default-mysql-client` for the more universally‑present `mysql-client` (or `default-mysql-client-core` together with its dependencies) resolves the apt error, and moving the `chmod +x wait-for-db.sh` line after the `COPY . .` ensures the script actually exists when you try to make it executable. After those two tweaks the image builds cleanly and the compose stack can start as intended.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
