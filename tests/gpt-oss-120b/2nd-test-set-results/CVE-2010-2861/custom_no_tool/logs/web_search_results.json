    "desc": "CVE\u20112010\u20112861 is a directory\u2011traversal (local file inclusion) vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion Administrator console. The flaw resides in the handling of the `locale` parameter on several CFIDE administrative pages (e.g., `enter.cfm`, `settings/mappings.cfm`, `logging/settings.cfm`). The parameter value is concatenated to a file path without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to supply sequences such as \"../\" (and a null byte) to cause ColdFusion to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. By requesting the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `locale` value, an unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve sensitive files such as `password.properties`, configuration files, source code, or system files. The disclosed information can be used to obtain administrative credentials or further compromise the server. Affected product versions are Adobe ColdFusion 8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, and 9.0.1. The vulnerability is mitigated by applying Adobe security bulletin APSB10\u201118, upgrading to a patched ColdFusion release, and restricting access to the CFIDE administrative interface.",
