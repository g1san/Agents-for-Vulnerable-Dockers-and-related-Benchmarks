CVE description: CVE‑2010‑2861 is a directory‑traversal (local file inclusion) vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion Administrator console. The flaw resides in the handling of the `locale` parameter on several CFIDE administrative pages (e.g., `enter.cfm`, `settings/mappings.cfm`, `logging/settings.cfm`). The parameter value is concatenated to a file path without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to supply sequences such as "../" (and a null byte) to cause ColdFusion to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. By requesting the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `locale` value, an unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve sensitive files such as `password.properties`, configuration files, source code, or system files. The disclosed information can be used to obtain administrative credentials or further compromise the server. Affected product versions are Adobe ColdFusion 8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, and 9.0.1. The vulnerability is mitigated by applying Adobe security bulletin APSB10‑18, upgrading to a patched ColdFusion release, and restricting access to the CFIDE administrative interface.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the CGI script is copied into the image without being marked as executable and the old httpd:2.2.15 image may no longer be available on the default registry; updating the base to a current supported tag (for example httpd:2.4) and adding a chmod step fixes both issues. In the Dockerfile, after copying the cgi-bin directory, run chmod -R 755 /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin so the vuln.cgi file can be executed, and change the FROM line to reference a valid httpd tag that still contains the CGI module (e.g., FROM httpd:2.4). With those two adjustments the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Apache container is failing because the CGI endpoint isn’t being mapped correctly – the configuration never tells Apache that “/cgi-bin/” should be served from /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/, so the script never runs. Add a ScriptAlias line (for example ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/) to httpd.conf and make sure the corresponding <Directory> block still has Options +ExecCGI and Require all granted. After rebuilding the image and redeploying with docker‑compose up the container should start and the vuln.cgi script will be reachable at http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/vuln.cgi.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely fails because the CGI script isn’t being recognized as executable – either its line endings are Windows‑style or the execute bit wasn’t set after it’s copied into the image. Add a line in the Dockerfile that normalises the script (for example `RUN sed -i 's/\r$//' /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/vuln.cgi && chmod +x /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/vuln.cgi`) so the file has Unix LF endings and is marked executable, then rebuild and restart the service. Once the script can run, Apache will start correctly and the vulnerable endpoint will be reachable.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Apache service fails to start in this setup is the mismatch between the Event MPM you load (`mpm_event_module`) and the classic CGI module (`mod_cgi`). The Event MPM cannot run `mod_cgi`; it requires `mod_cgid` (or you must switch to the Prefork MPM). To fix the container, edit `httpd.conf` so that the line‑loading the MPM reads `LoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so` (or replace `mod_cgi.so` with `mod_cgid.so` and keep the Event MPM). After updating the configuration, rebuild the image (`docker compose build`) and bring the service up again; Apache will now start correctly and the CGI script will be reachable.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container most likely fails because Apache can’t execute the CGI script – the default httpd image only loads the mod_cgi module for the worker MPM, while the configuration you use runs the prefork MPM. Add the cgid module to the httpd.conf (for example, insert `LoadModule cgid_module modules/mod_cgid.so` above the `<Directory "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin">` block) and rebuild the image so the script can be run under prefork; also make sure the script has Unix line endings and is marked executable (the Dockerfile already does a recursive chmod 755, but you can add an explicit `chmod +x /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/vuln.cgi` just to be safe). After updating the config and rebuilding, the service should start correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely isn’t starting because the CGI script isn’t being seen as an executable by Apache – the build step removes Windows CR characters but doesn’t guarantee the file is owned by the “www‑data” user that the httpd image runs as, so the script can be copied but then fails the permission check when Apache tries to exec it. Fix it by adding a `chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin` line after the `chmod -R 755 …` in the Dockerfile (or simply change the owner to the uid/gid that the base image uses) and keep the `chmod +x` call. Also double‑check that the `httpd.conf` you copy matches the base image’s default location (it should be `/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf`), and rebuild with `docker‑compose up --build`. After the CGI directory is owned by the proper user the service will come up normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is probably exiting because the Dockerfile tries to change ownership to a user called www‑data, but the official httpd:2.4 image does not create that account, so the chown command fails and aborts the build. To fix it, replace the chown line with a change to the existing daemon user (or simply omit it), e.g. chown -R daemon:daemon /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin. Also make sure the script is executable (the chmod line is fine) and that the shebang points to an interpreter that exists in the image – #!/bin/sh works with the base image. After updating the Dockerfile, rebuild the image and the vulnerable‑apache service should start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is likely aborting because the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) and the HTML page still contain Windows‑style carriage‑return characters, which make the httpd binary fail to parse the config at startup. Update the Dockerfile to strip “\r” from every file you copy into the image (for example, add a second `find … -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} \;` that targets `/usr/local/apache2/conf` and `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` after the `COPY` commands), then rebuild the image. This normalizes line endings, lets Apache start correctly, and the CGI script will be reachable as intended.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container most often fails to start because the CGI script isn’t marked as executable after the files are copied, so Apache can’t launch it and aborts with a “cannot execute” error. Add a concrete `chmod +x /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/vuln.cgi` (or `chmod -R 755 /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin`) after the `COPY` commands in the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, then restart the compose stack; this ensures the script has the right permissions and the Apache service will come up correctly. If the problem persists, double‑check that the line‑ending cleanup (`sed -i 's/\r$//'`) runs before the chmod step so the script isn’t corrupted by Windows carriage returns.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
