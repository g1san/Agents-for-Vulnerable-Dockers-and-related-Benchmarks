{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-35042 is a vulnerability in the Django web framework that affects the QuerySet.order_by() method. When an application passes a user\u2011controlled value directly to order_by() (for example via an `order` or `order_by` query\u2011string parameter), Django fails to properly validate or escape that value. The raw string is concatenated into the SQL ORDER BY clause, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL fragments. This results in a classic SQL injection condition where the attacker can execute additional SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE or other statements against the application's database, read confidential data such as password hashes, modify or delete records, and potentially compromise the entire database depending on the privileges of the web\u2011application account. The flaw is present in Django versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.12, 3.1.0 through 3.1.12, and early pre\u2011release versions of 3.2.0 up to 3.2.4. It was fixed in Django 3.1.13 and 3.2.5, where stricter validation of ordering fields was restored.",
