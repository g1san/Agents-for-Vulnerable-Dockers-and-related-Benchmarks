    "desc": "Apache JMeter versions 2.x and 3.x provide a built\u2011in Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service that is used for the distributed testing (master\u2011slave) feature. The RMI registry is started on port 1099 without any authentication or encryption. An attacker who can reach this RMI endpoint can obtain a reference to the internal JMeterEngine object and invoke arbitrary methods on it. By sending a maliciously crafted serialized payload (for example a CommonsCollections gadget created with ysoserial) the attacker causes deserialization on the slave side, which results in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the JMeter process. This flaw allows remote code execution on any host running a vulnerable JMeter server in distributed mode.",
