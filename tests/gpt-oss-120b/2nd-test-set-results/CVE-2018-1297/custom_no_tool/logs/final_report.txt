CVE description: Apache JMeter versions 2.x and 3.x provide a built‑in Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service that is used for the distributed testing (master‑slave) feature. The RMI registry is started on port 1099 without any authentication or encryption. An attacker who can reach this RMI endpoint can obtain a reference to the internal JMeterEngine object and invoke arbitrary methods on it. By sending a maliciously crafted serialized payload (for example a CommonsCollections gadget created with ysoserial) the attacker causes deserialization on the slave side, which results in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the JMeter process. This flaw allows remote code execution on any host running a vulnerable JMeter server in distributed mode.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image doesn’t have the development libraries needed to compile the mysqli extension, so the docker‑php‑ext‑install command aborts. Edit web/Dockerfile to first update the package index and install the MySQL client libraries (for example default‑mysql‑client or libmysqlclient‑dev) before invoking docker‑php‑ext‑install, and then clean up the apt cache; the resulting Dockerfile would start with RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* and then continue with the copy and expose steps. This resolves the compilation error and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP 5.6‑Apache base image is no longer supported on current Debian repositories, so the `apt-get install default‑mysql‑client` step can’t resolve the package and aborts the Dockerfile. To fix it, replace the base image with a supported, still‑maintained version (for example `php:7.4-apache` or `php:8.0-apache`), then adjust the Dockerfile to install the MySQL client from the appropriate package (`default-mysql-client` or `mariadb-client-core`) after an `apt-get update`. Once the image builds successfully, the rest of the compose file works unchanged, and the MySQL container will still be reachable via the environment variables you already set. If you need to stay on PHP 5.6, you can switch the base to a legacy Debian (e.g., `php:5.6-apache-bullseye`) that still contains the needed packages, but the simplest and more secure approach is to move to a newer PHP base image.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition only uses a PHP/Apache image for the web service and a MySQL 5.7 image for the database. Neither justb4/jmeter nor openjdk images are referenced in the docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, or any other configuration. Consequently, the required services are not present (services_ok = false) and no vulnerable version of justb4/jmeter is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker composition only uses a PHP/Apache image for the web service and a MySQL 5.7 image for the database. Neither justb4/jmeter nor openjdk images are referenced in the docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, or any other configuration. Consequently, the required services are not present (services_ok = false) and no vulnerable version of justb4/jmeter is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch you need to add the missing JMeter service to the compose file and base it on a justb4/jmeter image that contains the vulnerable 2.x/3.x release, pulling in the required openjdk runtime as its parent layer; for example, define a new service called “jmeter” that uses justb4/jmeter:2.15 (or any other listed vulnerable tag) and expose its RMI port 1099. Then adjust any dependent services to reference this new container if they need to communicate with JMeter, and ensure the openjdk:8‑jre‑alpine image is available either as a separate service or as the base for a custom JMeter image. Adding these entries will make the services list complete and provide the intended vulnerable component for testing.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is probably failing in the web Dockerfile because the mysqli extension can’t be compiled without the MySQL client libraries and the PHP development files; the current line only installs default‑mysql‑client but not the headers required for the extension. Fix it by installing the development packages (e.g., default‑mysql‑client and default‑mysql‑client‑dev or libmariadb‑client‑dev) before running docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli, and then clean the apt cache in the same RUN statement. After the packages are added the command will succeed and the image will build without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing in the web Dockerfile because the MySQL development package name is wrong and the image lacks the compiler tools needed for docker‑php‑ext‑install; updating the package list to install the correct dev package and the build utilities resolves the issue. Change the RUN line to first install build-essential (and any other required libs) and replace default‑libmysqlclient‑dev with the proper Debian package name libmysqlclient‑dev (or default‑mysql‑client‑dev depending on the distro), for example: apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y build-essential default‑mysql‑client libmysqlclient‑dev && docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*. After correcting the package name and ensuring the compiler is present the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP image does not have the MySQL client libraries needed to compile the mysqli extension; the simplest fix is to install the correct development packages and then enable the extension. In the web/Dockerfile replace the existing RUN line with something like:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libmariadb-dev-compat && \
    docker-php-ext-install mysqli && \
    docker-php-ext-enable mysqli && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

This ensures the required headers are present, compiles mysqli, enables it, and cleans the apt cache, allowing the image to build successfully. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑Apache base image cannot find the `libmariadb-dev-compat` package you request, so the `apt-get install` step aborts. Replace that package with one that actually exists in the Debian/Ubuntu repositories used by the php:7.4‑apache image— for example `default-mysql-client` and `default-mysql-client-dev` (or simply `libmysqlclient-dev` if you need the headers). After updating the `Dockerfile` to install only the available packages and then running `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` the image will compile successfully. Once the package list is corrected, the rest of the compose file can be brought up without further changes.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to install a non‑existent package (`default‑mysql‑client‑dev`), which stops the `apt‑get` step; replace it with the correct development package (`default‑libmysqlclient‑dev`) so the `mysqli` extension can be compiled, and keep the rest of the commands unchanged. After updating the `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y …` line to install `default-mysql-client` and `default-libmysqlclient-dev` (or `libmariadbclient-dev`), the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` step will succeed and the image will build correctly. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image is failing because the PHP‑Apache build can’t compile the mysqli extension – the required MySQL client development libraries aren’t available in the base php:7.4‑apache image. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct dev package (e.g. default-mysql-client and default-libmysqlclient-dev or, on newer Debian‑based images, default-mysql-client and default-mysql-client-dev or libmariadb-dev‑compat) before running docker-php-ext-install mysqli, and then clean the apt cache. Also make sure the copy line points at the correct source directory (the Dockerfile lives in web/ so COPY src/ /var/www/html/ is fine, but if you ever move it adjust the path accordingly). After adding the proper apt‑get line and cleaning up, the web image builds successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
