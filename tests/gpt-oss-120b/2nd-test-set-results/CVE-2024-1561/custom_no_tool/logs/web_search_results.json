    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u20111561 is a critical unauthenticated remote file read vulnerability in the Gradio Python web\u2011UI framework. The flaw resides in the `/component_server` endpoint, which allows an attacker to invoke any method on a Gradio component with attacker\u2011controlled arguments. By calling the `move_resource_to_block_cache` (or similar) method and supplying an arbitrary filesystem path, Gradio copies the target file into its temporary cache directory. The copied file can then be retrieved through the public `/file` endpoint, enabling an attacker to read any readable file on the host (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, environment files, private keys). The vulnerability is present in all Gradio releases prior to 4.13.0 and is especially exploitable when the application is launched with `share=True` or hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, where the UI is exposed to the Internet. Successful exploitation yields full disclosure of sensitive host data and can lead to further compromise.",
