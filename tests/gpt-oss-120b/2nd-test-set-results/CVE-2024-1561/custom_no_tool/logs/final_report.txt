CVE description: CVE‑2024‑1561 is a critical unauthenticated remote file read vulnerability in the Gradio Python web‑UI framework. The flaw resides in the `/component_server` endpoint, which allows an attacker to invoke any method on a Gradio component with attacker‑controlled arguments. By calling the `move_resource_to_block_cache` (or similar) method and supplying an arbitrary filesystem path, Gradio copies the target file into its temporary cache directory. The copied file can then be retrieved through the public `/file` endpoint, enabling an attacker to read any readable file on the host (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, environment files, private keys). The vulnerability is present in all Gradio releases prior to 4.13.0 and is especially exploitable when the application is launched with `share=True` or hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, where the UI is exposed to the Internet. Successful exploitation yields full disclosure of sensitive host data and can lead to further compromise.
Attack Type: remote file read
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [SOFT-WEB][python][['3.11.9']] Base runtime image used to run the Gradio application. Provides the Python interpreter and standard library needed for the Gradio web UI.
- [HARD][gradio][['4.12.0']] Vulnerable Gradio web UI library. The version 4.12.0 contains the flawed `/component_server` endpoint that permits arbitrary file reads.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image only includes Python (via the base image python:3.11-slim) and Flask as a dependency. There is no reference to the Gradio library in the Dockerfile or requirements.txt, so the required services list ['python', 'gradio'] is not fully satisfied. Consequently, the services_ok milestone fails. Additionally, because Gradio is not present, the image cannot be using the vulnerable Gradio version 4.12.0, so the code_hard_version milestone also evaluates to false.
	- ERROR: The Docker image only includes Python (via the base image python:3.11-slim) and Flask as a dependency. There is no reference to the Gradio library in the Dockerfile or requirements.txt, so the required services list ['python', 'gradio'] is not fully satisfied. Consequently, the services_ok milestone fails. Additionally, because Gradio is not present, the image cannot be using the vulnerable Gradio version 4.12.0, so the code_hard_version milestone also evaluates to false.
	- FIX: Add Gradio to the requirements.txt with a version that is not vulnerable (for example gradio>=4.13.0) and rebuild the image so the services list is satisfied. Then replace the insecure “/” handler with a safe implementation that either removes the endpoint entirely or validates the requested filename against a whitelist or a confined directory before calling send_file, ensuring no arbitrary path traversal is possible. Finally, rebuild and redeploy the container so the corrected code and the patched Gradio library are used.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the requirements.txt lists a misspelled package name – “grado” instead of the actual gradio library, so pip cannot find it and aborts the build. Change the line to “gradio>=4.13.0” (and optionally pin Flask to a compatible version), then rebuild the image; the Dockerfile will copy the corrected requirements, install the proper dependency, and the container will start correctly. If the build still errors, verify that the Dockerfile uses the correct working directory and that the requirements.txt file is present in the context, but fixing the typo is usually sufficient.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container isn’t starting because the image launches the script directly with `python app.py`, while the compose file also tries to treat it as a Flask application via the `FLASK_APP` environment variable; this mismatch can cause Flask to look for an app module that isn’t loaded when the process is started the other way around. To fix it, change the Dockerfile’s `CMD` to use Flask’s built‑in server and let the environment variables do the work – replace `CMD ["python", "app.py"]` with `CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=5000"]`. This aligns the runtime with the compose configuration, ensures the app is imported correctly, and the service will come up on port 5000 as expected.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The requirements.txt specifies "gradio>=4.13.0", which does not include the vulnerable version 4.12.0 listed for the gradio service. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. The Docker image does include both required services (python via the base image and gradio via pip), so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.
	- ERROR: The requirements.txt specifies "gradio>=4.13.0", which does not include the vulnerable version 4.12.0 listed for the gradio service. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. The Docker image does include both required services (python via the base image and gradio via pip), so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you need to pin Gradio to the vulnerable release instead of the safe range, so edit requirements.txt to read `gradio==4.12.0` (or `<4.13.0`). After updating the file, rebuild the image with docker‑compose so the gradio service version matches the expected vulnerable version while the rest of the stack remains unchanged. This simple change brings the hard‑coded version into alignment with the milestone requirements.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `requirements.txt` lists a non‑existent package name – it says `grado==4.12.0` instead of the correct `gradio==4.12.0`. When Docker runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` the lookup for “grado” aborts and the image can’t be built. To fix it, open `./app/requirements.txt` and replace the misspelled line with `gradio==4.12.0` (or whatever exact version you need). After correcting the package name, run `docker compose build` again; the image should compile successfully. If you also want to avoid any accidental use of the vulnerable Gradio version, you could upgrade to `gradio>=4.13.0`, but the essential fix is correcting the typo.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the requirements.txt contains a misspelled package name – it says grado==4.12.0 instead of the actual library gradio==4.12.0, so pip cannot find the package and aborts the image creation. Correct the typo by updating the line to gradio==4.12.0, then rebuild; the rest of the Dockerfile and compose file are fine and the container will start normally.


Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
