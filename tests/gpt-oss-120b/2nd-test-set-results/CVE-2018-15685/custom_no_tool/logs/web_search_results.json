    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201115685 is a remote code execution vulnerability in GitHub Electron. The flaw resides in Electron\u2019s handling of webPreferences inheritance for windows and iframes created with the options `nativeWindowOpen:true` or `sandbox:true`. When a parent window opens a nested child window or an iframe, Electron incorrectly falls back to insecure default settings\u2014node integration is enabled and context isolation is disabled\u2014allowing attacker\u2011controlled content to obtain full Node.js bindings. An attacker who can supply content to such a window (for example via XSS or loading remote HTML) can execute arbitrary JavaScript that runs with the privileges of the Electron application, giving full access to the host system\u2019s file system, network, and other resources. The vulnerability affects specific early Electron releases and was patched in later versions.",
