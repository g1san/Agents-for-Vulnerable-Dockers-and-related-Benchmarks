    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u20114123 is a high\u2011severity vulnerability in Grafana\u2019s core UI handling of the `/public` endpoint. The endpoint fails to properly validate encoded path segments, allowing attackers to perform path\u2011traversal and open\u2011redirect attacks. By crafting a URL that contains sequences such as `..%2F` or `%5C`, an unauthenticated attacker can cause Grafana to redirect to an arbitrary location, load malicious frontend plugins, and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim\u2019s browser (reflected cross\u2011site scripting). If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, the same open\u2011redirect can be leveraged to force the renderer to issue internal HTTP requests, resulting in full\u2011read server\u2011side request forgery. The vulnerability affects multiple Grafana versions released before the security patches (12.0.1, 11.6.2, 11.5.5, 11.4.5, 11.3.7, 11.2.10, 10.4.19). Exploitation does not require authentication, works with anonymous access, and can lead to credential theft, account takeover, and internal network reconnaissance.",
