    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201142323 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache HertzBeat (incubating) caused by unsafe deserialization of attacker\u2011controlled YAML configuration files using the SnakeYAML library. HertzBeat loads uploaded YAML files for monitor and alert imports (POST /api/monitors/import and POST /api/alert/defines/import) with SnakeYAML\u2019s `load` method without restricting the classes that may be instantiated. A malicious YAML payload can embed arbitrary Java objects (for example a Commons\u2011Beanutils payload) that trigger execution of `java.lang.Runtime.exec`, allowing an attacker who has valid HertzBeat credentials to run arbitrary commands on the host. The flaw affects all HertzBeat releases prior to 1.6.0; versions 1.6.0 and later include input validation and an updated SnakeYAML library that mitigates the issue.",
