CVE description: CVE‑2017‑9993 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) demuxer of FFmpeg. When parsing HLS playlists FFmpeg fails to restrict the allowed filename extensions and demuxer names. An attacker can embed a crafted "#EXT‑X‑MEDIA" (or similar) tag that references an arbitrary file path or a non‑HLS demuxer. When a vulnerable FFmpeg instance processes such a playlist it opens the referenced file on the host filesystem and writes its contents to the output stream, effectively leaking any readable file (arbitrary file read). The vulnerability is present in all FFmpeg releases prior to the fixed releases and requires only that FFmpeg be used to process untrusted HLS playlists; no additional privileges or code execution are required.
Attack Type: arbitrary file read resulting in information disclosure
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ffmpeg][['2.8.11', '3.0.0', '3.0.1', '3.0.2', '3.0.3', '3.0.4', '3.0.5', '3.0.6', '3.0.7', '3.1.0', '3.1.1', '3.1.2', '3.1.3', '3.1.4', '3.1.5', '3.1.6', '3.1.7', '3.2.0', '3.2.1', '3.2.2', '3.2.3', '3.2.4', '3.3.0']] Core vulnerable component; FFmpeg processes HLS playlists and contains the flawed HLS demuxer that allows arbitrary file reads.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.27.0']] Provides a web server to host malicious or legitimate HLS playlist files that FFmpeg will fetch and process.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test data for CVE-2017-9993 exploitation





Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided docker-compose.yml defines only a 'registry' service based on image registry:2.6.2. No ffmpeg or nginx services are present, so the required services list ['ffmpeg','nginx'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, there is no ffmpeg service to check its version against the vulnerable ffmpeg versions list, so a vulnerable 'hard' service version is not used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The provided docker-compose.yml defines only a 'registry' service based on image registry:2.6.2. No ffmpeg or nginx services are present, so the required services list ['ffmpeg','nginx'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, there is no ffmpeg service to check its version against the vulnerable ffmpeg versions list, so a vulnerable 'hard' service version is not used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services you need to extend the compose file by adding an nginx service that serves the HLS playlist and a ffmpeg service that runs the vulnerable binary; define ffmpeg using an image that contains a pre‑vulnerable release such as jrottenberg/ffmpeg:3.2.4‑alpine or build your own from the source versions listed, and mount the data directory into both containers so nginx can expose the crafted playlist and ffmpeg can read it. After adding those two service definitions with appropriate ports (e.g., 80:80 for nginx) and ensuring the ffmpeg container runs a command that processes the playlist, the compose configuration will meet the hard and soft service requirements.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the nginx container can’t find the custom configuration file at the path you gave it – the relative “./nginx/default.conf” mount doesn’t exist from the compose directory, so Docker aborts the start‑up. Move the default.conf file next to the compose file (or adjust the mount to the correct relative location) and change the nginx volume line to point at the real file, for example `- ${PWD}/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro`. After that the services will start and the ffmpeg command can reach the playlist at `http://nginx/playlist.m3u8` without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg service is exiting because the command stops after the ffmpeg process finishes (or fails) and the trailing tail is only run on a successful exit. Change the command so the container stays up regardless of the ffmpeg return code and make sure the URL includes the port that nginx listens on. For example, replace the command line with something like:

```yaml
command: >-
  sh -c "ffmpeg -i http://nginx:80/playlist.m3u8 -f null - || true; tail -f /dev/null"
```

This forces the container to remain alive after the exploit test runs and guarantees the hostname resolves correctly, fixing the startup problem.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg service is failing because it tries to read the playlist from the nginx container before nginx is ready to serve the file; adding a short wait before invoking ffmpeg (for example, using “sh -c 'until curl -s http://nginx/playlist.m3u8 > /dev/null; do sleep 1; done; ffmpeg -i http://nginx/playlist.m3u8 -f null - || true; tail -f /dev/null'”) ensures the HTTP endpoint is reachable. Also make sure the nginx volume mapping points to the correct directory (./data should contain playlist.m3u8) and that the file permissions allow nginx to read it; setting the volume as “…:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro” is fine, but verify the host path exists and contains the playlist. Finally, verify the ffmpeg image tag (jrottenberg/ffmpeg:3.2-alpine) is still available or replace it with a current tag, then restart the compose stack.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg container fails because the Alpine‑based image does not include curl, so the `until curl …` loop never succeeds and the service exits; to fix it, install curl inside the container before the loop and combine the whole startup script into a single‑line `sh -c` command (or wrap the commands in a small wrapper script). For example, replace the current `entrypoint` and `command` with a single `entrypoint: ["sh","-c","apk add --no-cache curl && until curl -s http://nginx:80/playlist.m3u8 > /dev/null; do sleep 1; done && ffmpeg -i http://nginx:80/playlist.m3u8 -f null - && tail -f /dev/null"]`. This ensures curl is available, the playlist can be fetched, and the ffmpeg process stays alive.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg container fails because its entrypoint tries to install curl and then run a long shell command in one `sh -c` string; the Alpine image may not have the `sh` interpreter reachable at that point, and the `apk add` step aborts the whole process, causing the container to exit before it can start ffmpeg. Fix it by building a tiny custom ffmpeg image that already contains curl (add a Dockerfile that `FROM jrottenberg/ffmpeg:3.2-alpine` and runs `apk add --no‑cache curl`), and then in docker‑compose replace the complex entrypoint with a simple command that just waits for the playlist to become available and runs ffmpeg, for example:

```yaml
ffmpeg:
  build: ./ffmpeg‑custom
  container_name: vulnerable_ffmpeg
  depends_on:
    - nginx
  command: /bin/sh -c 'until curl -s http://nginx:80/playlist.m3u8 >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done && ffmpeg -i http://nginx:80/playlist.m3u8 -f null - && tail -f /dev/null'
  volumes:
    - ./data:/data
```

By pre‑installing curl the container starts cleanly, and the command line now executes correctly, keeping the ffmpeg service alive.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg service is exiting because the command it runs never succeeds – the playlist points at a media segment that does not exist, so ffmpeg aborts after reading the malicious `#EXT‑X‑MEDIA` line. Add a dummy segment file (e.g. create an empty `dummy.ts` in the `data` directory) or change the playlist to reference a real segment that is actually served by nginx. Once the segment is reachable, the curl loop will succeed and the ffmpeg command will stay alive, fixing the container start‑up problem.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: I would adjust the ffmpeg service so the container never exits after the ffmpeg call – for example, replace the current entrypoint/command with a single sh ‑c string that loops until the playlist is reachable, runs ffmpeg with a quiet log level (to avoid a premature non‑zero exit), and then executes tail -f /dev/null unconditionally; this guarantees the container stays alive even if the ffmpeg process fails. At the same time I would confirm the build context path is correct ( docker‑compose.yml should point to the ffmpeg‑custom directory that contains the Dockerfile) and make sure the nginx service is on the same default network so the hostname nginx resolves; no other changes are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg container never reaches the tail command because the ffmpeg process exits with a non‑zero status before the semicolon is evaluated; the || true only covers the ffmpeg call itself, not the whole command line, so the shell treats the failure as a fatal error and stops the script. Change the command to group the ffmpeg invocation with a fallback that always returns success, for example: `sh -c "until curl -s http://nginx/playlist.m3u8 >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done && (ffmpeg -loglevel error -i http://nginx/playlist.m3u8 -f null - || true); tail -f /dev/null"`; this guarantees the container stays alive after the test and lets you see the exploitation output. Additionally, you can drop the explicit port in the URL (Docker’s internal DNS resolves the service name on the default HTTP port), which avoids any potential mismatch if the nginx service is later re‑mapped to a different host port. After rebuilding the ffmpeg‑custom image, `docker compose up` will start all three services and the ffmpeg container will remain running, showing whether the crafted playlist triggers the file‑read vulnerability.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
