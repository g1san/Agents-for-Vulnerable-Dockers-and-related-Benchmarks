    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20119993 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) demuxer of FFmpeg. When parsing HLS playlists FFmpeg fails to restrict the allowed filename extensions and demuxer names. An attacker can embed a crafted \"#EXT\u2011X\u2011MEDIA\" (or similar) tag that references an arbitrary file path or a non\u2011HLS demuxer. When a vulnerable FFmpeg instance processes such a playlist it opens the referenced file on the host filesystem and writes its contents to the output stream, effectively leaking any readable file (arbitrary file read). The vulnerability is present in all FFmpeg releases prior to the fixed releases and requires only that FFmpeg be used to process untrusted HLS playlists; no additional privileges or code execution are required.",
