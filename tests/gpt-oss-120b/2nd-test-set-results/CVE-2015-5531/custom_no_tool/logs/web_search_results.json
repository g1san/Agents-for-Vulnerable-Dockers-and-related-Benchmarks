    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20115531 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch. The flaw resides in the snapshot\u2011restore REST API where file paths supplied by a client are concatenated with internal paths without proper validation. An attacker can craft a snapshot request that includes \"../\" sequences (or URL\u2011encoded equivalents), causing Elasticsearch to read files outside the configured data directory. Because the Elasticsearch process runs with the privileges of the Java Virtual Machine on the host, any file that the process can access may be disclosed, such as configuration files, credential stores, source code, or system files. The vulnerability affects all Elasticsearch releases from version 1.0.0 through version 1.6.0. It is patched in version 1.6.1 and later (including the 1.7.0 series). Exploitation requires only network access to the Elasticsearch HTTP or transport ports; no authentication or special privileges are needed. The impact is confidential data exposure, making it a serious information\u2011disclosure issue.",
