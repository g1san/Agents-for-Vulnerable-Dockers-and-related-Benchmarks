CVE description: CVE‑2017‑18349 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Alibaba Fastjson JSON parsing library. Versions of Fastjson prior to 1.2.25 (and the range 1.2.24‑1.2.38 according to some sources) allow an attacker to control the class that is instantiated during JSON deserialization by supplying an "@type" attribute. By crafting a JSON payload that specifies the class `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` and setting its `dataSourceName` field to an attacker‑controlled RMI URL, Fastjson will perform a JNDI lookup. The lookup contacts the malicious RMI server, which returns a reference to a remote Java class containing a static initializer that executes arbitrary code. This results in remote code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable Java process. The vulnerability is triggered when Fastjson is used to parse untrusted JSON without enabling safe‑mode or proper type whitelisting. Mitigation requires upgrading Fastjson to version 1.2.25 or later, disabling AutoType, or enforcing strict class whitelists.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely fails because the `FLASK_ENV=development` setting expects the Flask CLI to be used, while the Compose file runs the script directly with `python /app/app.py`; upgrading Flask to a recent version (e.g., `Flask>=2.0`) and launching the app with the Flask CLI eliminates this mismatch—add `ENV FLASK_APP=app.py` to the Dockerfile (or the compose environment), change the `command` in docker‑compose.yml to `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000`, and rebuild the image; after that the service should start cleanly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image is based on python:3.8-slim and only installs Flask. It does not include the services fastjson, openjdk, or tomcat, so the required services list is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Because fastjson is not present, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable fastjson versions, thus the image does not use a vulnerable hard service version (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker image is based on python:3.8-slim and only installs Flask. It does not include the services fastjson, openjdk, or tomcat, so the required services list is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Because fastjson is not present, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable fastjson versions, thus the image does not use a vulnerable hard service version (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the required service list you must add a Java‑based service that includes the Fastjson library, OpenJDK and Tomcat, and reference it from the compose file. Replace the current single‑container setup with two services: keep the Flask container for any auxiliary logic, and add a new service (for example fastjson‑app) that builds from an openjdk:8‑jre‑alpine image, installs Tomcat 8.5, and copies a Java web application that depends on Fastjson 1.2.25 or newer; then expose the appropriate Tomcat port (e.g., 8080) and configure the Flask container to communicate with it if needed. Updating the compose file to include this second service and its network ensures the hard service version check can succeed and the environment complies with the CVE‑2017‑18349 service requirements.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the tomcat‑alpine image doesn’t provide the `openjdk8` package name you used – the Alpine repository names the JDK as `openjdk8-jdk` (or you can install just the JRE and the `javac` binary is missing, which Tomcat needs for JSP compilation). Change the `RUN apk add …` line in fastjson‑app/Dockerfile to install the correct package, for example: `apk add --no-cache openjdk8-jdk wget`. While you’re editing the file, move the Fastjson jar into the standard web‑app library directory (`WEB-INF/lib`) instead of Tomcat’s global lib folder, so replace the download target with something like `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app/WEB-INF/lib/fastjson-1.2.24.jar`. After these two adjustments the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `fastjson-app/Dockerfile` tries to install a package that doesn’t exist in the Alpine repositories – `openjdk8-jdk`. The official Alpine OpenJDK package is simply called `openjdk8`, and the Tomcat base image already includes a JDK, so you can either drop the extra installation entirely or replace the faulty package name with the correct one. Edit the Dockerfile to either remove the `apk add` line or change it to:

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache openjdk8 wget && \
    mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app/WEB-INF/lib && \
    wget -q -O /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app/WEB-INF/lib/fastjson-1.2.24.jar \
         https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/alibaba/fastjson/fastjson/1.2.24/fastjson-1.2.24.jar && \
    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```

After this correction the image will build successfully, allowing the two containers to start and the vulnerable Fastjson endpoint to be reachable.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Fastjson Dockerfile tries to download the JAR into a directory that doesn’t exist yet in the Tomcat image; the `mkdir -p` is executed before the `webapp` folder is added, so the subsequent `wget` can’t write the file. Move the `COPY webapp/ …` line above the `mkdir`/`wget` commands (or create the target directory after the copy), and simplify the install step by using a single `apk add --no‑cache wget` line followed by the download. After that the Fastjson image will build correctly and the Flask image needs no changes.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Fastjson container tries to drop the vulnerable JAR straight into `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson‑app/WEB‑INF/lib` before that directory actually exists – the `COPY` only creates the `webapp` hierarchy, not the `WEB‑INF/lib` sub‑folder, so the `wget` step cannot write the file and aborts. To fix it, edit the `fastjson‑app/Dockerfile` so that it creates the `WEB‑INF/lib` directory (for example with a `RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson‑app/WEB‑INF/lib` line) before the `wget` command, or combine the mkdir into the same `RUN` chain that installs `wget`. Once the target folder is guaranteed to exist, the JAR can be downloaded and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Tomcat‑alpine image runs as the non‑root *tomcat* user, so the `apk add` and the write to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson‑app/WEB-INF/lib` are denied; change the fastjson‑app Dockerfile to switch to the root user before installing wget, creating the directory and downloading the JAR, then switch back to the tomcat user (or simply keep root for the whole build) and finally expose port 8080 – this lets the image be built correctly. Additionally, you can collapse the separate `mkdir` and `wget` commands into a single `RUN` line to ensure the directory exists before the download, for example: `USER root && apk add --no-cache wget && mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app/WEB-INF/lib && wget -q -O /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app/WEB-INF/lib/fastjson-1.2.24.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/alibaba/fastjson/fastjson/1.2.24/fastjson-1.2.24.jar && chmod -R 755 /usr/local/tomcat/webapps && USER tomcat`. After this change the Docker compose should start without build errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Tomcat image doesn’t have the certificates needed to fetch the Fastjson JAR over HTTPS, so the `wget` step aborts and the subsequent `mkdir`/copy commands run on a partially‑created layer. Fix it by installing the CA‑certificates package before the download (e.g. `apk add --no-cache ca-certificates wget`) and then performing the `wget` of the Fastjson JAR; you can keep the existing `mkdir -p …/WEB-INF/lib` line, then switch back to the tomcat user as before. After adding the CA‑certificates step the image builds successfully and the vulnerable Fastjson jar is placed in the correct `WEB-INF/lib` directory.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the Tomcat‑based Dockerfile tries to copy the web application into a directory that does not yet exist and then writes library files into a sub‑folder owned by the non‑root tomcat user; the simplest fix is to create the target folder hierarchy first, copy the webapp into it while still running as root, and then adjust ownership before switching back to the tomcat user. In practice you would add a line such as `RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app && chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app` before the `COPY` command, move the `COPY webapp/ /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fastjson-app/` line after the directory creation, and keep the `USER tomcat` statement at the end; this ensures the folder exists and has the correct permissions so the subsequent `wget` and library placement succeed, allowing the Docker build to complete.
