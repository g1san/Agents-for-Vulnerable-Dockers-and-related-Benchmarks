    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201118349 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Alibaba Fastjson JSON parsing library. Versions of Fastjson prior to 1.2.25 (and the range 1.2.24\u20111.2.38 according to some sources) allow an attacker to control the class that is instantiated during JSON deserialization by supplying an \"@type\" attribute. By crafting a JSON payload that specifies the class `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` and setting its `dataSourceName` field to an attacker\u2011controlled RMI URL, Fastjson will perform a JNDI lookup. The lookup contacts the malicious RMI server, which returns a reference to a remote Java class containing a static initializer that executes arbitrary code. This results in remote code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable Java process. The vulnerability is triggered when Fastjson is used to parse untrusted JSON without enabling safe\u2011mode or proper type whitelisting. Mitigation requires upgrading Fastjson to version 1.2.25 or later, disabling AutoType, or enforcing strict class whitelists.",
