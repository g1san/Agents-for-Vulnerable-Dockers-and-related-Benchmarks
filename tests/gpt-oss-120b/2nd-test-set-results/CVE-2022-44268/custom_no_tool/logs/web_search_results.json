    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201144268 is an information disclosure vulnerability in ImageMagick. The flaw resides in the way ImageMagick parses PNG images containing specially\u2011crafted text chunks (for example a \"profile\" chunk that points to an arbitrary filename). When a vulnerable ImageMagick binary processes such a PNG\u2014typically via the `convert` or `magick` command\u2014the library reads the file referenced by the chunk and embeds its contents into the output image\u2019s metadata. An attacker who can supply a crafted PNG to a service that uses ImageMagick can therefore cause the binary to read any file that the process has permission to access (e.g., configuration files, credential files, or system files such as `/etc/hosts`) and retrieve its contents from the generated image. No code execution or denial\u2011of\u2011service impact is reported; the impact is the disclosure of confidential data.",
