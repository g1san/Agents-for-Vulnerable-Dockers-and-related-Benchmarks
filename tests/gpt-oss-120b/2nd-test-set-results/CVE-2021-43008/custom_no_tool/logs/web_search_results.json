    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201143008 is an information\u2011disclosure vulnerability in Adminer, a single\u2011file PHP web\u2011based database management tool. Versions from 1.0 up to and including 4.6.2 improperly validate the `file` parameter used in import/dump functionality and allow an unauthenticated attacker to supply a path\u2011traversal payload. When triggered, Adminer reads the specified file from the server\u2019s filesystem and returns its raw contents in the HTTP response, revealing sensitive configuration files, source code, credential stores, or any other readable file. The flaw is fixed in Adminer 4.6.3 and later. Exploitation does not require any special privileges; the attacker only needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable Adminer endpoint.",
