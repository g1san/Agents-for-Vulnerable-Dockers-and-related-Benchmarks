CVE description: CVE‑2017‑17562 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the GoAhead Web Server. Versions of GoAhead prior to 3.6.5 (specifically any version greater than 2.5 and less than 3.6.5) mishandle CGI requests by copying all HTTP query parameters directly into the environment of the forked CGI process without sanitising them. An attacker can inject special linker environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD via a crafted request. When the CGI script is dynamically linked, the glibc dynamic linker processes the injected LD_PRELOAD variable and loads an attacker‑provided shared‑object file, executing its constructors and thereby achieving arbitrary code execution on the server. The exploit requires only network access to the web server (default port 8080) with CGI enabled; no authentication is needed. Mitigation is to upgrade GoAhead to version 3.6.5 or later, or to disable CGI handling.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file points to a non‑existent build context and the client image is missing a working directory, which makes the COPY instruction ambiguous on some Docker versions. Change the client service’s `build:` line to use an absolute (or correctly relative) path such as `build: ./client` (ensuring that the Dockerfile lives in that folder) and add a `WORKDIR /app` before the COPY in the Dockerfile, then copy the script into that directory (`COPY exploit.py ./`). This gives the builder a clear target location and resolves the path error, allowing the image to compile successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Docker cannot find a valid image for the **goahead** service – the tag `goahead:3.6.4` is not a public image and no Dockerfile is provided to create it, so the compose file references a non‑existent image. To fix the problem you should either replace the image name with a publicly available GoAhead image that matches the vulnerable version (for example pulling a custom image you have built and pushed to a registry) or add a Dockerfile in a new directory (e.g., `./goahead`) that builds the GoAhead server from source and tags it `goahead:3.6.4`, then update the compose file to point to that build context (using `build: ./goahead`). Once the GoAhead image can be built or pulled successfully the rest of the compose stack—including the client image that already copies `exploit.py` and runs it—will start without errors. Additionally make sure the relative path `./client` is correct and that the `exploit.py` file exists in that directory; otherwise move the file or adjust the `COPY` instruction accordingly. After these adjustments the Docker compose command will complete and the placeholder exploit will execute.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image lacks the additional libraries required to compile GoAhead (for example, the OpenSSL development headers and linux‑headers that the Makefile expects), so the “make” step aborts. Add the missing packages to the APK install line—e.g., include openssl‑dev and linux‑headers—and then run the make command; the Dockerfile will then build successfully. If you prefer to avoid compilation issues altogether, replace the source‑build steps with a download of a pre‑compiled GoAhead binary for the targeted version and copy it into /opt/goahead before setting the entrypoint.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based image does not provide the GNU C library that GoAhead expects – it ships with musl instead – and the minimal tool chain installed with `build-base` isn’t enough for the upstream Makefile. The quickest way to get the image to compile is to switch the base image to a glibc‑based distribution (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) and install the standard development tools there. In practice you would change the first line of `goahead/Dockerfile` to something like `FROM debian:bookworm‑slim`, add `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y build-essential wget ca‑certificates libssl-dev linux-headers` (or the equivalent package list), keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged, and then rebuild. This provides the required glibc, header files and compiler/linker environment so the `make` step succeeds and the container can start the vulnerable GoAhead server.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the GoAhead source cannot be compiled with the current Debian‑bookworm‑slim image – the required header and development packages aren’t installed and the `linux-headers-generic` package simply doesn’t exist in Debian. To fix it, edit the GoAhead Dockerfile so that the `apt‑get install` line pulls the correct Debian packages (for example `linux-headers-amd64`, `libpcre3-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `autoconf`, `libtool`, and any other libraries the Makefile expects), then clean up the download step to extract the tarball with `--strip-components=1` (so the source ends up directly in `/opt/goahead`). After those changes the `make clean && make` command will succeed and the image will build normally.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the GoAhead source expects a few development packages that aren’t present in the slim Bookworm image – most notably the generic “linux‑headers‑amd64” meta‑package (which has been removed) and the “autoconf/ libtool” chain that the Makefile calls. Fix it by simplifying the dependency list to only the packages that actually exist and are needed for compilation: replace “linux‑headers‑amd64” with “linux-headers‑$(uname -r)” or drop it entirely, and add “git” (the Makefile pulls in sub‑modules). After the apt‑get line, add a clean‑up step and then run the build. In practice the Dockerfile’s RUN line becomes something like:

```sh
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential wget ca-certificates libssl-dev libpcre3-dev \
    zlib1g-dev autoconf libtool git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

With that change the image compiles successfully and the compose stack starts without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the GoAhead sources are never configured before they are compiled – the upstream project requires a ./configure step (or running make with a generated config.h) to generate the Makefile that includes the proper compiler and linker flags, and without it the subsequent make fails with “No rule to make target ‘all’”. To fix the image, add a line that runs the configuration script after extracting the archive (for example cd /opt/goahead && ./configure && make or, if the project uses autoconf, run autoreconf -i && ./configure) before invoking make clean && make. Keeping the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged will allow the image to finish building successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the tarball URL does not match the tag naming convention used by the upstream repository – the archive for version 3.5.0 is published under the name v3.5.0, not goahead‑3.5.0, so wget retrieves a 404 page that cannot be extracted. To fix it, change the wget command in the GoAhead Dockerfile to point to "https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/archive/refs/tags/v${GOAHEAD_VERSION}.tar.gz", which will correctly download the source archive, and then keep the rest of the steps unchanged; after this modification the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build error is caused by the source not being compiled into an executable named **goahead** in the work‑directory you later start, so the container can’t find `./goahead`. After the `make` step you need to either run the correct make target that produces the binary (for example `make goahead` or `make install` which puts the binary into `src/goahead`) or change the container’s working directory to the location where the binary is placed. Adding the missing `m4` package (required by `autoreconf`) to the list of apt‑installed tools also prevents the autoreconf step from failing. In practice the fix is to extend the Dockerfile’s install line with `m4`, run `make install` (or copy the built binary to `/opt/goahead/goahead`), and adjust the `CMD` to point at that path, e.g. `CMD ["/opt/goahead/src/goahead","-v","-p","8080"]`. This resolves the compilation failure and lets the service start correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
