    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201117562 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the GoAhead Web Server. Versions of GoAhead prior to 3.6.5 (specifically any version greater than 2.5 and less than 3.6.5) mishandle CGI requests by copying all HTTP query parameters directly into the environment of the forked CGI process without sanitising them. An attacker can inject special linker environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD via a crafted request. When the CGI script is dynamically linked, the glibc dynamic linker processes the injected LD_PRELOAD variable and loads an attacker\u2011provided shared\u2011object file, executing its constructors and thereby achieving arbitrary code execution on the server. The exploit requires only network access to the web server (default port 8080) with CGI enabled; no authentication is needed. Mitigation is to upgrade GoAhead to version 3.6.5 or later, or to disable CGI handling.",
