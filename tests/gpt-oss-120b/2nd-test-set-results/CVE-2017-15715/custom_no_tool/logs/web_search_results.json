    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201115715 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.29. The regular\u2011expression engine used by the `<FilesMatch>` directive incorrectly treats the end\u2011of\u2011string anchor `$` as matching a newline character. An attacker can upload a file whose name contains a newline (for example `malicious.php\\n.jpg`). The `$` anchor matches the newline instead of the true end of the filename, allowing the `<FilesMatch>` rule that is intended to block certain extensions to be bypassed. This results in prohibited files being stored on the server and potentially executed or served, leading to unauthorized code execution or information disclosure. The vulnerability is exploited by providing a specially crafted filename to a file\u2011upload mechanism that relies solely on `<FilesMatch>` patterns for validation. Mitigation requires upgrading Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.30 or later or replacing `<FilesMatch>`\u2011based filtering with more robust validation.",
