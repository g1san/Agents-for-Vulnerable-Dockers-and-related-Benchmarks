    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111981 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.10 when the platform is configured to use the CeleryExecutor. The vulnerability lies in the way Airflow deserializes task results coming from the Celery result backend (such as Redis or RabbitMQ). An attacker who can write data to the Celery result backend can inject a malicious pickle payload. When Airflow (either the web server or a worker) reads the poisoned result it unpickles the data without proper validation, causing unrestricted code execution with the privileges of the Airflow process. Exploitation requires (1) Airflow running with CeleryExecutor, (2) a reachable Celery result backend, and (3) the ability to write crafted data to that backend. The vulnerability affects all Apache Airflow releases up to and including 1.10.10; it is fixed in Apache Airflow 1.10.11 and later.",
