CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11981 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.10 when the platform is configured to use the CeleryExecutor. The vulnerability lies in the way Airflow deserializes task results coming from the Celery result backend (such as Redis or RabbitMQ). An attacker who can write data to the Celery result backend can inject a malicious pickle payload. When Airflow (either the web server or a worker) reads the poisoned result it unpickles the data without proper validation, causing unrestricted code execution with the privileges of the Airflow process. Exploitation requires (1) Airflow running with CeleryExecutor, (2) a reachable Celery result backend, and (3) the ability to write crafted data to that backend. The vulnerability affects all Apache Airflow releases up to and including 1.10.10; it is fixed in Apache Airflow 1.10.11 and later.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/airflow][['1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.10.3', '1.10.4', '1.10.5', '1.10.6', '1.10.7', '1.10.8', '1.10.9', '1.10.10']] Core Airflow service; versions 1.10.0‑1.10.10 contain the vulnerable CeleryExecutor code path that deserializes untrusted pickle data.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the one‑line `docker run … -it alpine …` that the exploit script invokes expects an interactive TTY, which isn’t available when Docker Compose launches the service, so the command immediately exits (or hangs waiting for input). To fix it, edit `exploit.sh` so the inner Docker command runs without the `-it` flags – simply `docker run --rm -v /:/hostfs alpine sh -c "echo 'Root on host:' && whoami && ls /hostfs/root"` – and then rebuild/re‑deploy the compose stack. This change lets the inner container execute non‑interactively, allowing the outer service to start and complete successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the inner docker command is executed inside an Alpine image that doesn’t contain the Docker client, so “docker run …” can’t be found, and even if it were, mounting the host filesystem requires the inner container itself to run privileged. Fix it by changing exploit.sh to use the same Docker image (or any image that includes the Docker CLI) for the inner container and adding the --privileged flag, e.g., replace the Alpine call with docker run --privileged --rm -v /:/hostfs docker:19.03.12 sh -c "…". After updating the script and rebuilding the image, the service should start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the container running, adjust the compose file so the service uses the Docker socket without also mounting it as a privileged container—remove `privileged: true` because the socket already gives the needed host‑engine access. Then change the `command` to invoke the script directly (e.g., `command: ["./exploit.sh"]`) and make sure the script’s shebang line matches the installed shell (`#!/bin/bash` works with the Alpine base, but you may need to install `bash` before copying the script). Finally, ensure the Dockerfile sets the working directory (e.g., `WORKDIR /`) so the script is found at runtime. These small edits let the compose service start and execute the exploit script as intended.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the container running you should grant it full privileges by adding privileged: true to the vulnerable-docker service definition in docker‑compose.yml, then rebuild and restart the stack; this allows the inner docker run command to create a privileged child container and mount the host filesystem as intended. Additionally, make sure the exploit.sh script is executable (the Dockerfile already does this) and that the host’s /var/run/docker.sock is correctly mounted, which you already have, so after adding the privileged flag the service should start without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container fails because the inner `docker run` that the script launches has no access to the host Docker daemon – only the outer container mounts `/var/run/docker.sock`. To fix it, change the command in `exploit.sh` so the inner container also mounts the socket (e.g., `docker run --privileged --rm -v /:/hostfs -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker:19.03.12 sh -c "…"`). With the daemon socket available, the nested Docker command can communicate with the host engine and the script will execute as intended.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is likely failing because the inner docker:19.03.12 image used by the exploit does not include the whoami binary, so the “docker run … sh -c … whoami …” command aborts and the script exits with an error. Fix the problem by editing exploit.sh to remove or replace the whoami call (for example, use id -u or simply omit it) and then rebuild the vulnerable-docker image; after that the compose file can stay unchanged and the service will start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that runs the exploit is trying to talk to the host Docker daemon through the socket but it never starts a daemon of its own, so the `docker run` inside `exploit.sh` can’t connect and the service exits. Change the `vulnerable-docker` service to use the Docker‑in‑Docker image (e.g. `docker:19.03.12-dind`) and add the daemon start command (or set `command: dockerd-entrypoint.sh`) so the Docker daemon is running inside that container; also keep the `privileged: true` flag and the socket mount. After that the script will be able to launch the inner privileged container and the service will stay up.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is likely failing because the entrypoint script is being run with sh, which doesn’t understand the Bash‑style “while (! docker info …)” loop, so the daemon never starts and the exploit never runs; change the command to invoke Bash (for example, `command: ["bash", "-c", "dockerd-entrypoint.sh & while ! docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done; ./exploit.sh"]`), and make sure the vulnerable‑docker service declares a dependency on the Redis service if it needs the backend available before the exploit runs. Adding the missing Airflow database connection variables (such as `AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`) will also allow the Airflow container to start, and ensuring the `docker` client is installed inside the inner image (or using the same Docker‑in‑Docker image for the inner run) will let the exploit script execute without errors.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow service is failing because it is started with a LocalExecutor while the environment variables are configuring a Celery backend, so the container can’t find the expected Celery components and exits; change AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR to CeleryExecutor (and add a scheduler container or run airflow scheduler as a second command) so the Celery settings are used correctly. In the vulnerable-docker service the Docker daemon is never exposed to the inner docker client, because the socket isn’t mounted; add a bind‑mount ‑v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock to the service definition (or use a Docker‑in‑Docker setup with --privileged and a proper healthcheck) so the docker command in exploit.sh can talk to the daemon. Finally, make the compose file wait for the Docker daemon healthcheck before launching exploit.sh (e.g., use depends_on with condition: service_healthy) so the script runs only after the daemon is ready. These changes will get both containers running correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
