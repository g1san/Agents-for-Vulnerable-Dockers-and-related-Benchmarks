    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20116920 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal 8 core. The flaw resides in Drupal\u2019s built\u2011in YAML parser (PECL yaml). When the yaml extension is present and the php.ini setting `yaml.decode_php` is enabled (default), the parser will unserialize any data tagged with `!php/object`. An attacker can craft a malicious YAML document containing a serialized PHP object (for example, GuzzleHttp\\\\Psr7\\\\FnStream with its `close` method pointing to an arbitrary function such as `phpinfo`). The crafted YAML can be submitted via the Configuration \u2192 Development \u2192 Configuration single import form, which passes the input directly to `Yaml::decode()`. During decoding, the object is unserialized, its magic method is invoked, and arbitrary PHP code is executed with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability affects all Drupal 8 releases prior to 8.3.4. Patching Drupal to 8.3.4 or later disables the unsafe deserialization by setting `yaml.decode_php` to 0, and disabling the yaml extension also mitigates the issue.",
