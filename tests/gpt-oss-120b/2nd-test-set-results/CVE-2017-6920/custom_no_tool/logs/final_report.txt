CVE description: CVE‑2017‑6920 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal 8 core. The flaw resides in Drupal’s built‑in YAML parser (PECL yaml). When the yaml extension is present and the php.ini setting `yaml.decode_php` is enabled (default), the parser will unserialize any data tagged with `!php/object`. An attacker can craft a malicious YAML document containing a serialized PHP object (for example, GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream with its `close` method pointing to an arbitrary function such as `phpinfo`). The crafted YAML can be submitted via the Configuration → Development → Configuration single import form, which passes the input directly to `Yaml::decode()`. During decoding, the object is unserialized, its magic method is invoked, and arbitrary PHP code is executed with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability affects all Drupal 8 releases prior to 8.3.4. Patching Drupal to 8.3.4 or later disables the unsafe deserialization by setting `yaml.decode_php` to 0, and disabling the yaml extension also mitigates the issue.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][drupal][['8.0.0', '8.0.1', '8.0.2', '8.0.3', '8.0.4', '8.0.5', '8.0.6', '8.0.7', '8.0.8', '8.0.9', '8.1.0', '8.1.1', '8.1.2', '8.1.3', '8.1.4', '8.1.5', '8.1.6', '8.1.7', '8.1.8', '8.1.9', '8.1.10', '8.2.0', '8.2.1', '8.2.2', '8.2.3', '8.2.4', '8.2.5', '8.2.6', '8.2.7', '8.2.8', '8.2.9', '8.2.10', '8.3.0', '8.3.1', '8.3.2', '8.3.3']] Drupal core contains the vulnerable YAML parser; using any of the listed versions exposes the system to remote code execution via crafted YAML payloads.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Drupal requires a relational database to store configuration and content; MySQL provides the necessary storage backend.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Acts as a web server/reverse proxy in front of the Drupal PHP application.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The web container is failing because the Python image only installs the packages listed in requirements.txt, which currently contains only Flask, so the import of pymysql in app.py raises a ModuleNotFoundError and the container exits. Add pymysql to requirements.txt (and optionally bump Flask to a newer version that still supports Python 3.6), rebuild the image, and the service will start; you can also simplify the start command by invoking the script directly (e.g., CMD ["python", "app.py"] instead of using flask run) to avoid any missing Flask‑CLI configuration. After updating the requirements and rebuilding with docker‑compose up the containers should come up correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The docker-compose setup only defines a MySQL service (image mysql:5.7) and a custom Python web service built from python:3.6‑slim. Neither drupal nor nginx are present, so the required services list ['drupal','mysql','nginx'] is not satisfied. Moreover, no drupal image is used, meaning none of the specified vulnerable drupal versions are in use.
	- ERROR: The docker-compose setup only defines a MySQL service (image mysql:5.7) and a custom Python web service built from python:3.6‑slim. Neither drupal nor nginx are present, so the required services list ['drupal','mysql','nginx'] is not satisfied. Moreover, no drupal image is used, meaning none of the specified vulnerable drupal versions are in use.
	- FIX: Add a Drupal service that uses an official Drupal image constrained to a safe version (≥ 8.3.4) and place it behind an Nginx container that proxies to Drupal’s PHP‑FPM port; keep the MySQL service unchanged and configure both Drupal and Nginx to point at the same database credentials. Replace the custom Python web service with the Drupal‑Nginx stack (or, if the Python app is still needed, run it on a separate port) and remove the vulnerable “/vuln” endpoint from the codebase. Finally, update the docker‑compose file to declare the three required services (drupal, nginx, mysql), set proper network links and healthchecks, and ensure the drupal image disables the yaml.extension or sets yaml.decode_php=0 so the original CVE‑2017‑6920 is not present.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state, but its healthcheck is failing. The health status is 'starting' with a failing streak of 2, and the healthcheck command 'curl -f http://localhost' returns exit code 7 (Connection refused) because the container only exposes port 9000/tcp, not port 80. Consequently, the container is not considered healthy or fully operational.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state, but its healthcheck is failing. The health status is 'starting' with a failing streak of 2, and the healthcheck command 'curl -f http://localhost' returns exit code 7 (Connection refused) because the container only exposes port 9000/tcp, not port 80. Consequently, the container is not considered healthy or fully operational.
	- FIX: The health‑check on the **drupal** service is trying to reach an HTTP endpoint on localhost, but the Drupal image only runs PHP‑FPM and listens on port 9000, not on port 80; therefore the curl –f http://localhost call always fails with “Connection refused”. To fix this, change the drupal health‑check so it probes something that actually answers on that container – for example replace the curl command with a TCP check against the FPM port (e.g. `["CMD","nc","-z","localhost","9000"]`) or, if you prefer an HTTP check, point it at the nginx service (`["CMD","curl","-f","http://nginx"]`). After updating the `healthcheck.test` line in the drupal service definition and redeploying, the container will become healthy.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Drupal image uses version 8.3.4 (DRUPAL_VERSION=8.3.4) which is not included in the allowed list that ends at 8.3.3.
	- ERROR: The Drupal image uses version 8.3.4 (DRUPAL_VERSION=8.3.4) which is not included in the allowed list that ends at 8.3.3.
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch, change the base image in ./../../dockers/CVE-2017-6920/custom_no_tool/drupal/Dockerfile from `drupal:8.3.4-fpm` to a version that appears in the allowed list, such as `drupal:8.3.3-fpm` (or any earlier 8.x release listed). After rebuilding the containers, the service will run a Drupal version that complies with the permitted range while still keeping the safe `yaml.decode_php = 0` setting.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The nginx service publishes host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default HTTP port 80, so it is not using the default network port. Additionally, the drupal service does not expose its default port (typically 80 or 9000) to the host, meaning the services are not all configured with their default ports.
	- ERROR: The nginx service publishes host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default HTTP port 80, so it is not using the default network port. Additionally, the drupal service does not expose its default port (typically 80 or 9000) to the host, meaning the services are not all configured with their default ports.
	- FIX: Change the nginx service’s port mapping to “80:80” so the container listens on the standard HTTP port externally, and add a ports section to the drupal service exposing the FPM port (for example “9000:9000”) or map port 80 if you prefer to access Drupal directly; this makes both services use their default ports and aligns the published ports with typical expectations. Ensure the dependent health‑checks still reference the correct internal addresses after the ports are adjusted.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Drupal service is exposing port 9000 ("9000:9000"), which is not the default HTTP port (80) used for web traffic. While MySQL and Nginx use their standard ports (3306 and 80 respectively), the non‑default mapping for Drupal means the services are not all set up on their expected default network ports.
	- ERROR: The Drupal service is exposing port 9000 ("9000:9000"), which is not the default HTTP port (80) used for web traffic. While MySQL and Nginx use their standard ports (3306 and 80 respectively), the non‑default mapping for Drupal means the services are not all set up on their expected default network ports.
	- FIX: Modify the docker‑compose.yml so the Drupal service no longer publishes a host port; simply remove the ports entry (or comment it out) because the container only needs to be reachable from the Nginx container on its internal 9000 port. This leaves the FPM listener on 9000 inside the Docker network while avoiding an unnecessary, non‑standard host‑side port exposure. The Nginx configuration already forwards PHP requests to drupal:9000, so no other changes are required.
