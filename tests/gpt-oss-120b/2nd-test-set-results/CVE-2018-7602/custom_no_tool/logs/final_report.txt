CVE description: CVE‑2018‑7602 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core affecting both the 7.x and 8.x branches. The flaw resides in several core subsystems that handle user‑supplied data, most notably the handling of the `destination` parameter and render‑array processing. An attacker can craft specially‑crafted HTTP requests that inject arbitrary PHP code into the render array, which is then executed by the web‑server process running the Drupal application. The vulnerability does not require prior authentication; it can be triggered by any remote host that can reach the Drupal web service on HTTP port 80. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full command execution privileges of the web‑server user (commonly www‑data), allowing complete compromise of the Drupal site, installation of malicious modules, cryptojacking scripts, or use as a foothold for further attacks on the surrounding network. The issue was publicly disclosed in the March 2018 security advisory SA‑CORE‑2018‑004 and has been actively exploited in the wild since its release. Patching to the first non‑vulnerable releases (Drupal 7.59, Drupal 8.4.8, and Drupal 8.5.3) eliminates the flaw, while unpatched installations remain trivially exploitable.
Attack Type: remote code execution

- [HARD][drupal][['7.0', '7.1', '7.2', '7.3', '7.4', '7.5', '7.6', '7.7', '7.8', '7.9', '7.10', '7.11', '7.12', '7.13', '7.14', '7.15', '7.16', '7.17', '7.18', '7.19', '7.20', '7.21', '7.22', '7.23', '7.24', '7.25', '7.26', '7.27', '7.28', '7.29', '7.30', '7.31', '7.32', '7.33', '7.34', '7.35', '7.36', '7.37', '7.38', '7.39', '7.40', '7.41', '7.42', '7.43', '7.44', '7.45', '7.46', '7.47', '7.48', '7.49', '7.50', '7.51', '7.52', '7.53', '7.54', '7.55', '7.56', '7.57', '7.58', '8.4.0', '8.4.1', '8.4.2', '8.4.3', '8.4.4', '8.4.5', '8.4.6', '8.4.7', '8.5.0', '8.5.1', '8.5.2']] The vulnerable Drupal core web application provides the code path that contains the remote code execution flaw. Deploying a Drupal container with any of the listed vulnerable versions reproduces the vulnerable environment.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Drupal requires a relational database to store its content and configuration. MySQL 5.7 supplies a compatible database backend for the Drupal container, enabling the application to start and be reachable for testing the vulnerability.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container logs contain a SEVERE error during deployment of /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war. The stack trace shows IllegalStateException caused by java.util.zip.ZipException: zip END header not found, indicating a corrupted or invalid WAR file. Although Tomcat reports server startup, the web application failed to initialize, meaning the container is not running the intended service correctly.
	- ERROR: The container logs contain a SEVERE error during deployment of /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war. The stack trace shows IllegalStateException caused by java.util.zip.ZipException: zip END header not found, indicating a corrupted or invalid WAR file. Although Tomcat reports server startup, the web application failed to initialize, meaning the container is not running the intended service correctly.
	- FIX: Replace the placeholder `struts2‑vuln.war` with a real, properly built WAR file that contains the compiled Struts 2 application and its dependencies; the current file is just text, so Tomcat cannot unzip it. You can either build the vulnerable WAR locally (e.g., using Maven to package the project with `struts2‑core‑2.3.34.jar`) and copy the resulting `target/your‑app.war` into the image, or download a pre‑built vulnerable WAR and reference that file in the `COPY` line. After updating the `Dockerfile` to copy the valid archive (ensuring the filename matches the copy target, e.g., `COPY your‑app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war`), rebuild the image and restart the compose stack; Tomcat will then be able to unzip the WAR and deploy the application correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but the Tomcat startup logs show a severe error when deploying the ROOT.war archive. The deployment fails with java.lang.IllegalStateException and a nested java.util.zip.ZipException “zip END header not found”, indicating the WAR file is corrupted. Consequently the web application cannot start even though the Tomcat server itself reaches the “Server startup” message. This means the container is not functioning correctly for its intended purpose.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running, but the Tomcat startup logs show a severe error when deploying the ROOT.war archive. The deployment fails with java.lang.IllegalStateException and a nested java.util.zip.ZipException “zip END header not found”, indicating the WAR file is corrupted. Consequently the web application cannot start even though the Tomcat server itself reaches the “Server startup” message. This means the container is not functioning correctly for its intended purpose.
	- FIX: Fix the failure by making sure the WAR file is a valid archive when it reaches the image. Replace the generic ARG and curl download with a step that fetches a known‑good WAR (or copy a pre‑downloaded WAR into the build context) and verify its integrity before moving it into /usr/local/tomcat/webapps. For example, add a `checksum` variable and run `curl -L -f -o /tmp/ROOT.war ${WAR_URL} && echo "${CHECKSUM}  /tmp/ROOT.war" | sha256sum -c -` so the build aborts if the download is incomplete or corrupted; then copy the file to webapps/ROOT.war. If you prefer not to download at build time, place a valid ROOT.war in the app directory and replace the curl step with `COPY ROOT.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war`. This guarantees Tomcat receives an uncorrupted WAR and the deployment will succeed.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but the Tomcat startup logs contain a SEVERE error while deploying the ROOT.war file. The stack trace shows an IllegalStateException caused by a java.util.zip.ZipException ("zip END header not found"), indicating the WAR archive is corrupted or incomplete. As a result the web application failed to deploy even though the server process started. This deployment failure means the container is not operating correctly for its intended purpose.

The stack trace shows an IllegalStateException caused by a java.util.zip.ZipException ("zip END header not found"), indicating the WAR archive is corrupted or incomplete. As a result the web application failed to deploy even though the server process started. This deployment failure means the container is not operating correctly for its intended purpose.
	- FIX: Fix the issue by supplying a valid, complete ROOT.war file in the build context (the ./app directory) and then rebuilding the image; the placeholder text must be replaced with an actual WAR archive that is correctly zipped and includes all required entries, otherwise Tomcat cannot unpack it. After the proper WAR is present, the COPY instruction in the Dockerfile will place the intact archive into /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war and the container will start without the “zip END header not found” error. Finally, run docker compose up again to recreate the app service with the corrected image.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running, but Tomcat failed to deploy the ROOT.war web application. The logs show a SEVERE error with java.util.zip.ZipException: zip END header not found, causing an IllegalArgumentException and preventing the webapp from starting. Therefore the container is not operating correctly for its intended service.
	- ERROR: The container is running, but Tomcat failed to deploy the ROOT.war web application. The logs show a SEVERE error with java.util.zip.ZipException: zip END header not found, causing an IllegalArgumentException and preventing the webapp from starting. Therefore the container is not operating correctly for its intended service.
	- FIX: The problem is caused by the ROOT.war file being corrupted, so Tomcat cannot read its zip structure. Replace the placeholder ROOT.war with a valid WAR archive that contains the expected web application files (for example, build the WAR locally with Maven or Gradle and copy the resulting *.war into the Docker build context). Alternatively, unpack the WAR contents into a directory (e.g., /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT) and copy that directory instead of the broken archive, letting Tomcat treat it as an exploded webapp. After updating the Dockerfile to reference the proper artifact and rebuilding the image, Tomcat will be able to deploy the application and the container will start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not include a Drupal service. The 'app' service is built from a Tomcat base image (tomcat:9.0-jdk11-openjdk) and only deploys a placeholder webapp, so no Drupal version is present to match the allowed list. Consequently, the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails. Additionally, the required services list ['drupal','mysql'] is not fully satisfied because the Drupal service is missing, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail.

Consequently, the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails. Additionally, the required services list ['drupal','mysql'] is not fully satisfied because the Drupal service is missing, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Replace the placeholder Tomcat service with a real Drupal service: change the app service to build (or pull) a Drupal image of a vulnerable version (for example drupal:7.58 or drupal:8.4.7), copy the Drupal source into /usr/src/drupal and let the container start Apache or php‑fpm as needed, and expose the standard HTTP port (80) or map it to 8080. Remove the Tomcat Dockerfile entirely, or rename it to a separate build if you still need it, and update docker‑compose.yml so the app service uses the Drupal image, keeps the same environment variables for the database, and still depends on the db service. This adds the missing Drupal service, satisfies the required ['drupal','mysql'] list, and ensures the Drupal version matches one of the vulnerable releases, allowing the code_hard_version and services_ok milestones to succeed.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The app container maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080, so it is not exposed on the default HTTP port. While the database container correctly maps its internal port 3306 to the default host port 3306, the mismatch for the app service means the network setup does not use the expected default ports.
	- ERROR: The app container maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080, so it is not exposed on the default HTTP port. While the database container correctly maps its internal port 3306 to the default host port 3306, the mismatch for the app service means the network setup does not use the expected default ports.
	- FIX: To align the application with the expected default HTTP port, change the port mapping in the docker‑compose.yml for the app service from "8080:80" to "80:80". This will expose the Drupal web server on the host’s standard port 80 instead of the alternate 8080 and ensure the network setup matches the default expectations. No other changes are required for the database mapping, which already uses the standard MySQL port 3306.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
