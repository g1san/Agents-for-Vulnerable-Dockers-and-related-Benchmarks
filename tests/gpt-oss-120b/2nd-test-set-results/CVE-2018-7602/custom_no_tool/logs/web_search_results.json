    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20117602 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core affecting both the 7.x and 8.x branches. The flaw resides in several core subsystems that handle user\u2011supplied data, most notably the handling of the `destination` parameter and render\u2011array processing. An attacker can craft specially\u2011crafted HTTP requests that inject arbitrary PHP code into the render array, which is then executed by the web\u2011server process running the Drupal application. The vulnerability does not require prior authentication; it can be triggered by any remote host that can reach the Drupal web service on HTTP port 80. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full command execution privileges of the web\u2011server user (commonly www\u2011data), allowing complete compromise of the Drupal site, installation of malicious modules, cryptojacking scripts, or use as a foothold for further attacks on the surrounding network. The issue was publicly disclosed in the March\u202f2018 security advisory SA\u2011CORE\u20112018\u2011004 and has been actively exploited in the wild since its release. Patching to the first non\u2011vulnerable releases (Drupal 7.59, Drupal 8.4.8, and Drupal 8.5.3) eliminates the flaw, while unpatched installations remain trivially exploitable.",
