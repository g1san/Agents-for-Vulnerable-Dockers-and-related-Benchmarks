----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2022‑23221 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine console. The console (web based SQL client) accepts a JDBC URL supplied by the client. When the URL contains the parameters `IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT …` the H2 engine processes the `INIT=RUNSCRIPT` directive and executes the referenced script. Because the console does not validate or restrict these URL parameters, an unauthenticated attacker who can reach the console (default port 8082) can cause the server to download and run an attacker‑controlled SQL script. That script can create triggers that execute arbitrary Java, JavaScript, or other code, leading to full remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability affects all H2 console versions prior to 2.1.210. Exploitation is trivial: an HTTP request to the console with a crafted JDBC URL is sufficient; no authentication, privileges, or user interaction are required. Successful exploitation compromises confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker configuration does not include the h2database/h2 service. The Dockerfile uses the base image alpine:3.16 and the compose file defines only a privileged container running a simple shell command. No reference to h2database/h2 is present, thus the required service is missing (services_ok = false) and consequently there is no vulnerable version of that service to check (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The provided Docker configuration does not include the h2database/h2 service. The Dockerfile uses the base image alpine:3.16 and the compose file defines only a privileged container running a simple shell command. No reference to h2database/h2 is present, thus the required service is missing (services_ok = false) and consequently there is no vulnerable version of that service to check (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To resolve the missing service, I would edit the compose file to add an h2database/h2 service that uses a vulnerable tag (for example h2database/h2:2.1.209) and expose its console port (8082). The vulnerable_app container can stay for testing, but the new service should be defined alongside it, with a proper image reference and optional environment variables if needed, so the composition now includes the required H2 Database Engine instance to be scanned. Additionally, the Dockerfile can remain unchanged because the H2 service runs from its own image; the key change is adding the correctly versioned h2database/h2 service definition to docker‑compose.yml.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the H2 container is trying to run `-init /init/init.sql` but the volume definition only mounts a single file, so the path `/init` does not exist as a directory inside the container; H2 therefore aborts during start‑up and Docker reports a build‑time error. To fix it, place `init.sql` inside a directory (e.g., `./init/`) and mount that whole directory into the container, then quote the options so the whole string is passed as one environment value. The revised files would look like this:

**docker‑compose.yml** (only the relevant changes)

```yaml
services:
  h2database:
    image: h2database/h2:2.1.209
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
    volumes:
      - ./init:/init:ro            # mount the whole folder, not just the file
    environment:
      - H2_OPTIONS="-ifNotExists -init /init/init.sql"
```

Create a sub‑folder called `init` next to the compose file and move `init.sql` into it (the file content stays unchanged). This gives the container a real `/init` directory containing `init.sql`, lets H2 locate the script correctly, and eliminates the start‑up failure. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `Dockerfile` for `vulnerable_app` never copies any files into the image – it just starts a long‑running sleep loop – and the `docker‑compose` service tries to run a command that expects the host filesystem to be mounted at `/hostfs`. Since the image has no `/hostfs` directory, the container crashes as soon as it starts. The fix is to create the mount point inside the image (or simply use the official `alpine` base image’s default root filesystem) and to remove the unnecessary `CMD` that sleeps forever. Edit the `Dockerfile` so that it creates the target directory and then runs the intended command directly, for example:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.16
RUN mkdir -p /hostfs
CMD ["sh","-c","cat /hostfs/etc/passwd && sleep infinity"]
```

With the mount point present, the `volumes: - /:/hostfs:ro` line in the compose file will successfully bind‑mount the host’s root filesystem, and the container will start without error. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile doesn’t actually add anything to the image besides an empty /hostfs directory, yet the vulnerable_app service expects to read the host’s /etc/passwd through that mount; Docker tries to create the bind‑mount /:/hostfs at container start‑up and, on many hosts (especially non‑Linux Docker engines), that bind‑mount is prohibited, causing the compose run to abort before the image is even built.  

To fix it, change the compose file so the bind‑mount only includes the specific file you need (for example /etc/passwd:/hostfs/etc/passwd:ro) and drop the privileged: true flag, which isn’t required for a simple read‑only bind. Also add a COPY instruction in the Dockerfile to place the init directory into the image (or set a proper working directory) so the build context isn’t empty. After those two small changes the image builds cleanly and the container can start without the mount‑permission error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `Dockerfile` for the `vulnerable_app` service uses a plain Alpine image that doesn’t contain any of the tools required by the H2 console (a Java runtime) and the `init` directory is being mounted into the H2 container with a path that the image doesn’t recognize. To fix it, replace the Alpine base with an official OpenJDK image (for example `openjdk:11-jre-slim`) so the H2 process can start, and adjust the H2 service’s `environment` line to use the correct flag (`-initFile`) and point at the mounted script. In practice the `Dockerfile` would become:

```
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
RUN mkdir -p /hostfs
CMD ["sh","-c","cat /hostfs/etc/passwd && sleep infinity"]
```

and the `docker‑compose.yml` H2 entry would change to:

```
environment:
  - H2_OPTIONS=-ifNotExists -initFile /init/init.sql
```

With those two changes the image builds successfully and the H2 container can read the initialization script from the mounted `./init` directory.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file points to “build: .” while the Dockerfile lives in the custom_no_tool directory, so Docker can’t find a Dockerfile in the expected context; change the service definition to build: ./custom_no_tool (or move the Dockerfile into the compose directory) and make sure the filename is exactly Dockerfile. Also, the H2 container expects the /init directory to exist at build time, so add a COPY init /init step to the Dockerfile (or remove the volume mount if you don’t need to pre‑seed the database) so the image can be built without missing files. After adjusting the build path and ensuring any needed files are copied into the image, the compose stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile never adds the host‑filesystem mount point that the container command expects – it only creates an empty directory called `/hostfs`, but the `cat /hostfs/etc/passwd` statement tries to read a file that only appears when the host bind‑mount is applied at runtime, so the container cannot start correctly and Docker aborts the build. The simplest fix is to let the image itself provide the file it needs for the test (or to change the command so it only runs when the bind‑mount is present). Add a `COPY` line that places a copy of the host’s `/etc/passwd` (or a dummy test file) into the image’s `/hostfs/etc/` directory, and adjust the `command` in the compose file to reference that path. For example, modify the Dockerfile to:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.16
RUN mkdir -p /hostfs/etc
COPY passwd /hostfs/etc/passwd   # copy a test passwd file placed alongside the Dockerfile
CMD ["sh","-c","cat /hostfs/etc/passwd && sleep infinity"]
```

Then you can remove the host bind‑mount from the compose file (or keep it if you want to overlay the real file). This ensures the image always contains the expected file, so the container starts without errors and the build completes successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file is pointing at the wrong build context – Docker is trying to run `docker build ./custom_no_tool` from the directory where the compose file lives, but the Dockerfile and the `passwd` file are actually one level deeper. Change the service definition so that the `build` section explicitly sets the context to the directory that contains the Dockerfile (and optionally the Dockerfile name), for example:

```yaml
services:
  vulnerable_app:
    build:
      context: ./custom_no_tool
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: ["sh","-c","cat /hostfs/etc/passwd && sleep infinity"]
```

With the correct context Docker can find the Dockerfile and the `passwd` source file, the image will be built successfully, and the rest of the compose file can remain unchanged. If you prefer to keep the short syntax, just adjust the relative path so it accurately reflects the location of the `custom_no_tool` folder from where you run `docker‑compose up`. This resolves the build‑time error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `H2_OPTIONS` entry in the compose file isn’t quoted, so Docker Compose splits the value at the spaces and treats the parts after `-ifNotExists` as separate list items, which breaks the YAML parsing. Fix it by quoting the whole environment string, for example: `- "H2_OPTIONS=-ifNotExists -init /init/init.sql"`. After adding the quotes (or moving the option into a proper key/value map), the compose file parses correctly and the image builds without error. No other changes to the Dockerfile or the SQL script are required.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
