    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201123221 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine console. The console (web based SQL client) accepts a JDBC URL supplied by the client. When the URL contains the parameters `IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT \u2026` the H2 engine processes the `INIT=RUNSCRIPT` directive and executes the referenced script. Because the console does not validate or restrict these URL parameters, an unauthenticated attacker who can reach the console (default port 8082) can cause the server to download and run an attacker\u2011controlled SQL script. That script can create triggers that execute arbitrary Java, JavaScript, or other code, leading to full remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability affects all H2 console versions prior to 2.1.210. Exploitation is trivial: an HTTP request to the console with a crafted JDBC URL is sufficient; no authentication, privileges, or user interaction are required. Successful exploitation compromises confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system.",
