{
    "desc": "CVE-2024-27348 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph Server. The flaw resides in the server\u2019s request handling (Gremlin/REST API) where user\u2011supplied Groovy code or serialized objects are evaluated without proper validation. An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP request that injects malicious Groovy or serialized payloads, which are then executed by the underlying Java runtime. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host where HugeGraph Server is running, achieving full system compromise. The vulnerability affects deployments running on Java\u00a08 or Java\u00a011 and is exploitable over the network without any authentication.",
