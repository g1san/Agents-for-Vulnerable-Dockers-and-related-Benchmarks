----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2022‑24816 is a critical code‑injection vulnerability in the jt‑jiffle component of the JAI‑EXT library. When a Jiffle script is supplied via a network request, the library forwards the script unchanged to the Janino compiler, which generates Java source code and compiles it at runtime. Because the generated source is placed inside a Javadoc comment without escaping the comment terminator, an attacker can close the comment (using */) and inject arbitrary Java statements. The malicious code is compiled and executed when the Jiffle runtime later loads a class such as `Double`. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host, for example by calling `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)`. The most common downstream product that exposes this flaw is GeoServer, which bundles jt‑jiffle < 1.1.22. Exploitation is performed by sending a crafted WPS `Execute` request to the GeoServer WPS endpoint (e.g., `/geoserver/wms` or `/geoserver/ows`) with the `ras:Jiffle` process and a malicious `script` parameter. The result is uncontrolled remote code execution with the privileges of the GeoServer process.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][geoserver][['2.17.2']] GeoServer version 2.17.2 includes the jt‑jiffle component from JAI‑EXT version 1.1.21, which is vulnerable to CVE‑2022‑24816. Running this image provides the exact vulnerable code path needed to reproduce the code‑injection flaw.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker daemon started and container is reported as running, but the configured healthcheck (CMD curl -f http://localhost:2375/_ping) repeatedly fails because the 'curl' executable is missing inside the container. The health status remains 'starting' with a failing streak of 3, indicating the container is not healthy.
	- ERROR: Docker daemon started and container is reported as running, but the configured healthcheck (CMD curl -f http://localhost:2375/_ping) repeatedly fails because the 'curl' executable is missing inside the container. The health status remains 'starting' with a failing streak of 3, indicating the container is not healthy.
	- FIX: Add the missing curl binary to the daemon container and make the compose file use that custom image. In the Dockerfile install curl (for the Debian‑based Docker image you can `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) and tag the built image (e.g., `my‑dind‑with‑curl`). Then change the compose service to `build: ./custom_no_tool` (or `image: my‑dind‑with‑curl`) instead of pulling `docker:20.10.14-dind` directly. With curl present the healthcheck `curl -f http://localhost:2375/_ping` will succeed and the container will become healthy.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `docker:20.10.14-dind` image is Alpine‑based, so `apt‑get` isn’t available; you need to install curl with Alpine’s package manager instead. Change the Dockerfile line to `RUN apk add --no-cache curl` (removing the `apt‑get` commands and the cleanup of `/var/lib/apt/lists`). With curl now correctly installed the image will build and the compose healthcheck will be able to query the daemon on port 2375.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile only builds from the base image docker:20.10.14-dind and installs curl. No geoserver service or binary is installed, and no reference to a geoserver version (e.g., 2.17.2) appears in the Dockerfile, docker‑compose.yml, or the inspected image metadata. Therefore the required geoserver service is missing (services_ok = false) and the specific hard‑coded version is not used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile only builds from the base image docker:20.10.14-dind and installs curl. No geoserver service or binary is installed, and no reference to a geoserver version (e.g., 2.17.2) appears in the Dockerfile, docker‑compose.yml, or the inspected image metadata. Therefore the required geoserver service is missing (services_ok = false) and the specific hard‑coded version is not used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: Add a step in the Dockerfile that installs a Java runtime, downloads the GeoServer 2.17.2 binary (which contains the vulnerable jt‑jiffle 1.1.21), extracts it and copies the webapp into the Docker‑in‑Docker environment, then start the GeoServer servlet container (for example with Tomcat or Jetty) instead of only launching dockerd. The compose file should keep the privileged Docker daemon but also expose the GeoServer HTTP port (e.g., 8080) and set any required environment variables (such as JAVA_OPTS) so that the container runs both the Docker daemon and the GeoServer service, ensuring the vulnerable version is actually present.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the GeoServer start‑up script isn’t executable and the container never exposes the web interface, so Docker aborts the build when the health‑check can’t reach the service. Fix it by making the startup script runnable and telling Docker that the service listens on port 8080. Add a single `chmod +x /opt/geoserver/bin/startup.sh` line after the unzip step (or combine it with the existing `RUN` chain) and insert an `EXPOSE 8080` instruction before the `ENTRYPOINT`. With the script marked executable and the port declared, the daemon can start, the health‑check can connect, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container fails because the entrypoint replaces the Docker daemon process with GeoServer, so when GeoServer exits the daemon is lost and the container stops. Change the script so that the daemon stays in the foreground (or at least is waited on) and start GeoServer as a separate background process. For example, start `dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock` in the background, wait until the `_ping` endpoint responds, then launch `/opt/bin/startup.sh &` and finally add `wait` (or `wait $DOCKER_PID`) so the script doesn’t exit while the daemon is running. This keeps both services alive and fixes the startup problem.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the GeoServer binary is never found – the `GEOSERVER_HOME` variable points at a directory that does not exist after the unzip step. When the zip is expanded the top‑level folder is named `geoserver‑2.17.2`, not `geoserver‑2.17.2‑bin`; therefore `${GEOSERVER_HOME}` ends up pointing at a non‑existent path and the later `chmod +x ${GEOSERVER_HOME}/bin/startup.sh` and the entrypoint script both error out. To fix it, change the `GEOSERVER_HOME` definition to match the real extraction target, e.g.:

```
ENV GEOSERVER_HOME=/opt/geoserver-2.17.2
```

and after the `unzip` command adjust the folder name if necessary:

```
RUN unzip /tmp/geoserver.zip -d /opt && \
    mv /opt/geoserver-${GEOSERVER_VERSION}* ${GEOSERVER_HOME}
```

or simply set `GEOSERVER_HOME` to the path that the zip creates (`/opt/geoserver-${GEOSERVER_VERSION}`) and remove the `chmod +x ${GEOSERVER_HOME}/bin/startup.sh` line because the startup script is already executable. With the correct path the Dockerfile builds successfully, and the entrypoint can launch both `dockerd` and GeoServer without hitting a “file not found” error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the image you start from (`docker:20.10.14-dind`) is a Debian‑based Docker‑in‑Docker image, but the Dockerfile tries to install packages with `apk`, which only exists on Alpine. To fix it, change the package‑install line to use Debian’s package manager. Replace the `apk add --no-cache …` command with something like `apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jre curl unzip && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. After that the rest of the Dockerfile (downloading GeoServer, extracting it and setting permissions) will work unchanged and the image will build successfully. If you prefer to keep using `apk`, switch the base image to an Alpine‑based one (for example `alpine:3.17`) and install Docker daemon manually, but the simplest correction is to use `apt‑get` with the current `docker:dind` base.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because GEOSERVER_HOME points at /opt, but after the zip is extracted the server lives in a sub‑directory such as /opt/geoserver‑2.17.2‑bin (or /opt/geoserver‑2.17.2). The startup script therefore isn’t found and the chmod and later entry‑point call both error out. Fix it by changing the GEOSERVER_HOME environment variable to the actual unpacked directory (for example ENV GEOSERVER_HOME=/opt/geoserver-${GEOSERVER_VERSION}) and make sure the chmod line and the entrypoint reference ${GEOSERVER_HOME}/bin/startup.sh accordingly. After that the Dockerfile builds without the “file not found” error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based `docker:20.10.14-dind` image does not provide the `openjdk11-jre` package that the `apk add` line requests, so the package manager aborts the install step and the Dockerfile never finishes. The quickest way to fix it is to replace the JRE package with one that actually exists in the Alpine repositories (for example `openjdk11` which pulls in the JRE), and to make sure the shell script that starts GeoServer uses a shell that is present in the image (Alpine ships with `sh`, but the GeoServer startup script expects `bash`). Adding `bash` to the installed packages and invoking the startup script with `bash` (or simply using `sh` to execute it) resolves the runtime‑launch problem. So modify the `RUN` line to:

```
RUN apk add --no-cache openjdk11 bash curl unzip && \
    mkdir -p /opt && \
    curl -L -o /tmp/geoserver.zip https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/geoserver/GeoServer/${GEOSERVER_VERSION}/geoserver-${GEOSERVER_VERSION}-bin.zip && \
    unzip /tmp/geoserver.zip -d /opt && \
    rm /tmp/geoserver.zip && \
    chmod +x ${GEOSERVER_HOME}/bin/startup.sh
```

and change the entrypoint to invoke the startup script with the newly added `bash` binary:

```
bash ${GEOSERVER_HOME}/bin/startup.sh &
```

These two small changes install a valid JDK/JRE package and provide the required shell, allowing the image to be built and the container to start without errors.
