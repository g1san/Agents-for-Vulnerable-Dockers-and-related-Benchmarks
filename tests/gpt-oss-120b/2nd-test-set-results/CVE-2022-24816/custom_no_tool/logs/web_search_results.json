    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201124816 is a critical code\u2011injection vulnerability in the jt\u2011jiffle component of the JAI\u2011EXT library. When a Jiffle script is supplied via a network request, the library forwards the script unchanged to the Janino compiler, which generates Java source code and compiles it at runtime. Because the generated source is placed inside a Javadoc comment without escaping the comment terminator, an attacker can close the comment (using */) and inject arbitrary Java statements. The malicious code is compiled and executed when the Jiffle runtime later loads a class such as `Double`. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host, for example by calling `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)`. The most common downstream product that exposes this flaw is GeoServer, which bundles jt\u2011jiffle\u202f<\u202f1.1.22. Exploitation is performed by sending a crafted WPS `Execute` request to the GeoServer WPS endpoint (e.g., `/geoserver/wms` or `/geoserver/ows`) with the `ras:Jiffle` process and a malicious `script` parameter. The result is uncontrolled remote code execution with the privileges of the GeoServer process.",
