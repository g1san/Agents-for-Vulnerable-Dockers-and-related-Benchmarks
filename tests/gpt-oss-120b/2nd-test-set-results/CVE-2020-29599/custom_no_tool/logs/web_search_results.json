    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201129599 is a vulnerability in the ImageMagick image\u2011processing library. Versions of ImageMagick prior to 6.9.11\u201140 and prior to 7.0.10\u201140 mishandle the `-authenticate` option (used for opening password\u2011protected PDF files) and also incorrectly process the `clip-path` attribute when converting SVG files. In both cases user\u2011controlled input is passed directly to a shell command or used to compute a buffer size without proper validation, leading to an integer overflow and a heap\u2011based buffer overflow. An attacker who can supply a crafted PDF (with a malicious password) or a malicious SVG (with an exaggerated `points` count) to any service that automatically invokes ImageMagick for conversion can cause arbitrary command execution on the host. This results in remote command execution, allowing the attacker to run commands with the same privileges as the ImageMagick process, which may lead to full system compromise.",
