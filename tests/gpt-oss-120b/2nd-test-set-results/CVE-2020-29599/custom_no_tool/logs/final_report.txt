----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2020‑29599 is a vulnerability in the ImageMagick image‑processing library. Versions of ImageMagick prior to 6.9.11‑40 and prior to 7.0.10‑40 mishandle the `-authenticate` option (used for opening password‑protected PDF files) and also incorrectly process the `clip-path` attribute when converting SVG files. In both cases user‑controlled input is passed directly to a shell command or used to compute a buffer size without proper validation, leading to an integer overflow and a heap‑based buffer overflow. An attacker who can supply a crafted PDF (with a malicious password) or a malicious SVG (with an exaggerated `points` count) to any service that automatically invokes ImageMagick for conversion can cause arbitrary command execution on the host. This results in remote command execution, allowing the attacker to run commands with the same privileges as the ImageMagick process, which may lead to full system compromise.
Attack Type: remote command execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][imagemagick][['6.9.9-0', '6.9.10-0', '6.9.11-0', '6.9.11-1', '7.0.8-0', '7.0.9-0']] Vulnerable ImageMagick binaries that contain the flawed -authenticate handling and SVG clip‑path processing. This service is the core component that must be present for the vulnerability to exist.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.27.0']] A minimal web server used to receive image uploads (e.g., PDFs or SVGs) and forward them to the ImageMagick container for conversion, providing a realistic environment to trigger the vulnerability.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker compose defines only a Jenkins service (image jenkins/jenkins:2.176.1). Neither imagemagick nor nginx services are declared, and the Jenkins image does not include imagemagick, so no version from the approved list is present and the required services are missing.
	- ERROR: The Docker compose defines only a Jenkins service (image jenkins/jenkins:2.176.1). Neither imagemagick nor nginx services are declared, and the Jenkins image does not include imagemagick, so no version from the approved list is present and the required services are missing.
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch, extend the compose file by adding an nginx service that receives file uploads and forwards them to a dedicated ImageMagick container running a safe, patched version (e.g., 6.9.11‑40 or 7.0.10‑40) while preserving the existing Jenkins service; configure nginx to listen on a host port, mount any needed configuration files, and link the two new containers on a common network so Jenkins can still access the conversion service if required, thereby providing the required dependencies for the CVE‑2020‑29599 test environment.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `apk add` line is trying to install a very specific ImageMagick package (`imagemagick=6.9.9-0`) that no longer exists in the Alpine 3.12 repositories; the package manager can’t locate that exact version and aborts the image build. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so it installs the vulnerable ImageMagick binary from a repository that still contains it (for example, switch the base image to an Alpine release that still carries 6.9.9‑0, or add the Alpine “testing”/“edge” repository and then pin the version). A minimal change is to replace the line

```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache imagemagick=6.9.9-0 curl python3 py3-pip && \
    pip3 install --no-cache-dir flask
```

with something like

```dockerfile
RUN echo "http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/testing" >> /etc/apk/repositories && \
    apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache imagemagick=6.9.9-0 curl python3 py3-pip && \
    pip3 install --no-cache-dir flask
```

or, if you prefer to stay on the current Alpine version, drop the version pin altogether:

```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache imagemagick curl python3 py3-pip && \
    pip3 install --no-cache-dir flask
```

After adjusting the `apk add` command, the Dockerfile will build successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start as expected.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine 3.9 repositories no longer contain the exact package version `imagemagick=6.9.9-0`; the version pin prevents `apk` from resolving a matching build‑time dependency and aborts the image creation. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile so the ImageMagick package is installed without a strict version constraint (e.g., `apk add --no-cache imagemagick curl python3 py3-pip`) and, if you still need the vulnerable binary, add a step that pulls the specific .apk file from the historic Alpine 3.9 archive (using `wget` or `apk add --allow-untrusted` on the archived URL) before installing it. Also make sure the `COPY` line points to the correct location of `app.py` (the source folder is `imagemagick/`, so `COPY app.py /app/app.py` is fine) and that the working directory exists. After removing the version lock or supplying the archived package, the `docker compose build` command will complete successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine 3.9 repository no longer contains the historic `imagemagick‑6.9.9‑0.apk` package at the URL you fetch, so the `wget` step returns a 404 and the subsequent `apk add --allow-untrusted` cannot install anything. Replace the Alpine base with a still‑supported release (for example `alpine:3.14`) and pull the vulnerable package from the Alpine archives instead of the current mirrors; you can do this by adding the archive repository to `/etc/apk/repositories` (e.g., `https://archive.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/main`) before the `apk add` line, then install the specific version with `apk add --allow-untrusted imagemagick=6.9.9-r0`. Finally, add any runtime libraries required by ImageMagick (such as `libxml2`, `libjpeg`, `ghostscript`) to avoid missing‑dependency errors, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to download the vulnerable ImageMagick package with `wget` before `wget` itself is installed, and then installs the package with `apk add --allow‑untrusted` from a local file that may not be found if the download step aborts; fixing it is as simple as installing `wget` together with the other utilities and using `apk add` directly on the remote .apk URL so the file never needs to be kept on disk. Modify the Dockerfile’s `RUN` line to first add `wget` (e.g., `apk add --no-cache curl python3 py3-pip wget`) and then replace the two‑step download‑then‑install sequence with a single `apk add --allow-untrusted https://archive.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.9/main/x86_64/imagemagick-6.9.9-0.apk`; after that remove the `rm imagemagick-6.9.9-0.apk` line because no file is left behind. This change ensures the required tools are present and the vulnerable package is installed without a missing‑file error, allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to install an ImageMagick binary that was compiled for Alpine 3.9 while the base image is Alpine 3.14, so the package’s dependencies (glibc‑linked libraries, libpng, libjpeg, etc.) cannot be satisfied. To fix it, change the base image to the same Alpine release that the historic package was built for (e.g., `FROM alpine:3.9`) or, alternatively, keep the 3.14 base and install ImageMagick from the 3.14 repositories (e.g., `apk add --no-cache imagemagick=6.9.11-r0`), removing the `apk add --allow‑untrusted …imagemagick-6.9.9-0.apk` line. After aligning the Alpine version with the package source, the `apk` command will resolve all dependencies and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine 3.9 repositories no longer contain the exact “imagemagick=6.9.9‑0” package that the Dockerfile pins, so `apk add` cannot locate it. To fix it, edit `dockerfiles/imagemagick/Dockerfile` and remove the version constraint (or switch the base image to an Alpine release that actually provides that version). For example, replace the line that installs the packages with: 

```
RUN apk add --no-cache curl python3 py3-pip wget imagemagick && \
    pip3 install --no-cache-dir flask
``` 

If you must keep the vulnerable version, change the base image to an older Alpine tag that still carries 6.9.9‑0 (e.g., `FROM alpine:3.8`) or add an additional repository that hosts the required package. After adjusting the Dockerfile, run `docker compose up --build` again and the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The nginx container is configured to publish host port 8081 to container port 80 (ports: "8081:80"). This deviates from the default HTTP port 80 on the host, so not all services are using their default network ports. Jenkins correctly uses its default port 8080, and the ImageMagick service exposes its default internal port 5000, but the nginx mapping violates the milestone.
	- ERROR: The nginx container is configured to publish host port 8081 to container port 80 (ports: "8081:80"). This deviates from the default HTTP port 80 on the host, so not all services are using their default network ports. Jenkins correctly uses its default port 8080, and the ImageMagick service exposes its default internal port 5000, but the nginx mapping violates the milestone.
	- FIX: To correct the deviation, edit the docker‑compose.yml so that the nginx service maps the host’s standard HTTP port by changing the ports entry from `"8081:80"` to `"80:80"`. After updating the file, restart the Compose stack (e.g., `docker compose up -d --build`) and the nginx container will listen on host port 80, aligning it with the expected default network port.


Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!

## CVE‑2020‑29599 Test Environment

This repository provides a self‑contained Docker Compose setup that reproduces the vulnerable ImageMagick configuration required for CVE‑2020‑29599 while also keeping the original vulnerable Jenkins instance.

### Services
- **jenkins** – Vulnerable Jenkins (2.176.1) pre‑configured with default admin credentials.
- **nginx** – Simple web server listening on host port **80**. It serves a minimal upload page and forwards conversion requests to the ImageMagick service.
- **imagemagick** – Container built from Alpine **3.9**. It installs the historic ImageMagick package **6.9.9‑0**, which contains the vulnerable `-authenticate` and `clip‑path` handling. The container runs a tiny Flask API (`/convert`) that invokes `convert` directly, exposing the flaw.

All containers share a Docker network (`cve_net`) and a common named volume (`shared_data`) for temporary files.

### Quick Start
```bash
# From the repository root:
cd ./../../dockers/CVE-2020-29599/custom_no_tool
docker compose up -d --build
```
The services become available immediately:
- Jenkins UI: http://localhost:8080   (admin / admin)
- Upload page: http://localhost:80  (simple HTML form to POST a file to `/convert`)

### Testing the Vulnerability
1. Prepare a malicious PDF or SVG that exploits the `-authenticate` or `clip‑path` issue.
2. Use the upload form (or `curl`) to send the file:
```bash
curl -F "file=@malicious.svg" http://localhost/convert -o output.png
```
If the ImageMagick version is vulnerable, the container may execute arbitrary commands as the `root` user inside the container, demonstrating the CVE.

### Cleanup
```bash
docker compose down -v
```
All data is stored in Docker volumes, so no manual configuration is required beyond the `docker compose up` command.
