    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20115254 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x. The broker accepts Java serialized objects via JMS ObjectMessage (or the HTTP/CGI interface) without enforcing a whitelist of trusted classes. An attacker who can send a crafted serialized payload to the broker causes the Java deserialization process to execute arbitrary code on the server. The flaw exists in all ActiveMQ releases prior to 5.13.0 and can be triggered over the network without authentication, giving the attacker full control of the host running the broker. The vulnerability is rated CVSS v3.1 9.8.",
