CVE description: CVE‑2021‑42392 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the Java H2 database engine. The flaw resides in the org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection method, which accepts a driver class name and a JDBC URL supplied by the H2 Console (or other entry points). By providing a driver that implements javax.naming.Context (for example, javax.naming.InitialContext) together with a malicious JNDI URL such as ldap://attacker.com/Exploit, the method performs an uncontrolled JNDI lookup. This causes the H2 process to download and execute attacker‑controlled bytecode, giving the attacker full code execution on the host running the console. The vulnerability is exploitable when the H2 Console is configured to listen on non‑localhost interfaces (using the -webAllowOthers option) and no authentication or other security constraints are applied. All H2 versions prior to 2.0.206 are affected.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not include any h2database/h2 image, so no vulnerable H2 version from the provided list is used (code_hard_version = false). The defined services are php:5.6-apache for the web container and mysql:5.7 for the db container; neither h2database/h2 nor openjdk appear, therefore the services_ok milestone fails.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition does not include any h2database/h2 image, so no vulnerable H2 version from the provided list is used (code_hard_version = false). The defined services are php:5.6-apache for the web container and mysql:5.7 for the db container; neither h2database/h2 nor openjdk appear, therefore the services_ok milestone fails.
	- FIX: To satisfy the services_ok milestone you need to add the missing H2 component to the composition, for example by inserting a service that uses the h2database/h2:2.0.206 image (or a later patched version) and configuring its console with ‑webAllowOthers disabled or bound only to localhost so the vulnerable JNDI endpoint cannot be reached externally. At the same time, tighten the PHP web‑app by removing the unchecked include() call: validate the file parameter against a whitelist of allowed scripts or, better, replace the dynamic inclusion with a static route that serves only intended resources. After these changes the stack will contain a non‑vulnerable H2 instance and the web container will no longer expose a remote code inclusion flaw.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP‑5.6 image you’re trying to pull is no longer present in the default Docker Hub registry; recent registries have removed the old 5.6‑apache tag or renamed it to include the underlying OS version. Change the base line in web/Dockerfile to a tag that still exists, for example `FROM php:5.6-apache-buster` or upgrade to a supported version such as `php:7.4-apache`, and then run `docker compose build` again. If the image still can’t be found, you can also add the `--platform=linux/amd64` flag to force pulling the legacy manifest. After fixing the base image tag, the compose file will assemble without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the base image referenced in the web Dockerfile no longer exists in the registry; replace the outdated php:7.4‑apache tag with a current, supported tag (for example php:8.2‑apache or php:7.4‑apache‑buster) and keep the `COPY src/ /var/www/html/` line unchanged so the source files are still added. After updating the `FROM` line the image can be built successfully and the compose stack will start.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file pulls a vulnerable H2 image (2.0.205) that is no longer available in the registry after it was replaced by patched releases, and the container is also started with “‑webAllowOthers”, which triggers the CVE‑2021‑42392 exploit. Fix the problem by updating the H2 service to a safe version (for example ghcr.io/h2database/h2:2.0.206 or any newer tag) and remove the insecure “‑webAllowOthers” flag from the H2_OPTIONS environment variable (or replace it with a secure configuration that requires authentication). After changing the image tag and adjusting the H2_OPTIONS line, docker‑compose will be able to build the PHP‑Apache image normally and the stack will run without triggering the known vulnerability.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is most likely caused by Docker not being able to find the files it is asked to copy – either the web service’s Dockerfile isn’t where the compose file expects it (it must be ./custom_no_tool/web/Dockerfile relative to the compose file) or the src directory isn’t present inside that build context. To fix it, move the Dockerfile into the web folder (or adjust the build path in the compose file to point to the folder that actually contains the Dockerfile) and make sure a src sub‑folder with the PHP files lives next to that Dockerfile so the COPY src/ /var/www/html/ instruction succeeds. After those path corrections the images should build without error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file points to a relative “./web” directory that does not exist from the compose file’s location, so Docker can’t find the Dockerfile or the source files; fixing it is simply a matter of correcting the build context to the actual path (for example, change `build: ./web` to `build: ./custom_no_tool/web` or move the compose file into the custom_no_tool folder) and making sure the src folder is inside that context, and also removing the stray colon after `db_data` in the volumes section so it reads `db_data:` instead of `db_data:` with an extra colon. Once the paths and volume definition are aligned, the images will build without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Docker can’t find the H2 image you referenced – the tag `2.0.206` doesn’t exist in the GitHub Container Registry, so the compose file aborts when it tries to pull it. Change the `h2db` service to use a real, published tag (for example `ghcr.io/h2database/h2:2.1.214` or simply `ghcr.io/h2database/h2:latest`) and keep the same environment variable; after that the compose file will pull the image successfully and the rest of the stack will start without further changes. If you want the console to be reachable from outside you can also add `-webAllowOthers` to `H2_OPTIONS`, but that isn’t required for the build to succeed.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the web service’s Dockerfile is trying to copy a directory that doesn’t exist at the expected path; the build context is ./web so COPY src/ /var/www/html/ looks for ./web/src relative to the compose file, but the source tree actually places the PHP files directly under ./web (the src folder is missing or named differently). To fix it, either move the PHP files into a src sub‑directory inside ./web or change the Dockerfile to copy the correct location, e.g.:

```
FROM php:8.2-apache
COPY . /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
```

(Or, if you prefer to keep the src layout, create a web/src folder and place the PHP files there.) After correcting the copy path, the image will build successfully. If you still want to keep a separate source folder, make sure the folder name matches exactly (including case) and that it is committed to the repository before running docker‑compose up.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file points at paths that don’t exist from the directory where you run docker‑compose – the web service’s build.context (`./web`) and the MySQL init‑script mount (`./db/init.sql`) are resolved relative to the compose file location, not to the repository root where the docker‑compose.yml actually lives. Change those paths to the correct relative locations (for example, set build.context to `./custom_no_tool/web` and the init‑script mount to `./custom_no_tool/db/init.sql`), or move the compose file into the custom_no_tool directory and invoke docker‑compose from there so the existing relative paths resolve correctly. After fixing the paths, the images will build without errors.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
