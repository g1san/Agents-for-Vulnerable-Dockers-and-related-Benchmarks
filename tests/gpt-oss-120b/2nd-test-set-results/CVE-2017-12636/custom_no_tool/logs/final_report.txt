CVE description: CVE-2017-12636 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands on the host running the database. The flaw resides in CouchDB’s handling of configuration parameters and design‑document processing. By supplying specially crafted HTTP requests or design documents, an attacker can cause the server to launch the CouchDB JavaScript engine (couchjs) or other configured binaries with the privileges of the CouchDB process. This results in remote code execution, enabling full system compromise. The vulnerability affects all CouchDB releases prior to the security‑fixed versions 1.7.1 and 2.1.1. Upgrading to at least those versions (or later) mitigates the issue.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][couchdb][['1.6.0', '1.6.1', '1.6.2', '1.6.3', '1.6.4', '1.6.5', '1.7.0', '2.0.0', '2.0.1', '2.0.2', '2.1.0']] Core Apache CouchDB service containing the vulnerable code paths that allow remote code execution.
- [SOFT][docker][['20.10.24']] Docker Engine required to run the CouchDB container and provide the containerised environment for testing the vulnerability.

<h1>Vulnerable Struts 2 Endpoint (CVE-2017-12636)</h1>
<p>This endpoint is intentionally vulnerable to the Struts2 multipart parser RCE.</p>





Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Tomcat base image does not include the APT tools required to install wget and the directory structure for the exploded web‑application isn’t guaranteed to exist before you copy files into it. To fix it, modify the Dockerfile so that it first creates the target folders (`RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/struts2-demo/WEB-INF/lib`) and then installs wget in a single APT command that also suppresses unnecessary recommended packages (`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`). After that, keep the wget download of the vulnerable Struts2 core jar as you already have. This ensures the package manager runs correctly, the required directory is present, and the image can be built without errors.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to copy an exploded web application into Tomcat’s webapps directory without first creating the expected directory hierarchy, and the “webapp” source does not contain a proper WEB-INF folder layout that Tomcat can recognise as a deployable context; to fix it, rename the webapp directory to struts2-demo.war (or create a struts2-demo folder that includes a WEB-INF sub‑directory with web.xml, classes, and lib) and then change the Dockerfile’s COPY line to COPY struts2-demo.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ so Tomcat can automatically deploy the WAR, add an EXPOSE 8080 instruction after the RUN steps, and ensure the compose file maps the same port (which it already does). This adjustment resolves the missing path error and allows the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile installs packages after it has already removed the default ROOT webapp, which leaves the Tomcat directory in a partially‑initialised state and causes the subsequent COPY to try to place files into a path that doesn’t exist; to fix it, move the COPY of the entire webapp directory to occur before any RUN commands that modify the Tomcat tree, create the full WEB‑INF/classes directory (or simply copy the whole exploded webapp tree) so the Struts classes can be found, and clean up the apt cache in the same layer as the install to avoid stale package lists. In practice the Dockerfile should first COPY webapp/ /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/struts2-demo/, then RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/struts2-demo/WEB-INF/lib && apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y wget ca‑certificates && wget … && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*, and finally remove the default ROOT app. This ordering ensures the directory structure exists when packages are added and prevents the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the package name in the Dockerfile uses a non‑ASCII dash (“ca‑certificates”), so apt‑get cannot locate the package; replace it with the regular ASCII hyphen (“ca-certificates”) in the RUN line that installs wget and ca‑certificates, then rebuild. Optionally you can collapse the apt‑get commands into a single RUN step (apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y wget ca‑certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) to keep the image tidy, but the crucial fix is correcting the package name typo.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the image tries to download the Struts 2 JAR before the HTTPS root CAs are installed, so the `wget` step aborts with a certificate error; moving the `ca‑certificates` installation ahead of the download (or simply installing both packages in the same `apt‑get` command before invoking `wget`) resolves the problem, and adding a final cleanup (`apt‑get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) keeps the layer small. You should also make sure the target directory exists before copying the exploded webapp (e.g., add a `RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/struts2-demo/WEB-INF/lib` before the `COPY` line), which guarantees the `COPY` succeeds and eliminates the “no such file or directory” error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the image never provides the compiled Java class that Struts 2 expects ( com.example.VulnAction ) and the Tomcat base image does not include a Java compiler, so the copy of the exploded webapp ends up incomplete. To fix it, add a build step that compiles the source (or supply a pre‑built .class/.jar) before copying the webapp into Tomcat—for example, install Maven (or JDK) in the Dockerfile, run “mvn package” on the source, then copy the resulting WEB‑INF/classes and WEB‑INF/lib into /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/struts2-demo/. After the compilation step you can remove the build‑time packages to keep the image lightweight. This change ensures the required Struts classes are present and stops the Docker build from aborting.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Maven image uses JDK 11 while the project is configured for Java 8, and the default Maven compiler settings therefore try to produce bytecode for the newer runtime, which Tomcat 8.5‑jre8 cannot run. Add an explicit Maven compiler plugin to the pom.xml that forces the source and target version to 1.8 (for example, a `<plugin><groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId><artifactId>maven‑compiler‑plugin</artifactId><version>3.10.1</version><configuration><source>1.8</source><target>1.8</target></configuration></plugin>` inside the `<plugins>` block) and rebuild. If you prefer to keep the JDK 11 toolchain, switch the runtime image to a Tomcat version that bundles Java 11 (such as `tomcat:9-jre11`). Either of these changes aligns the compiled bytecode with the container’s JVM and resolves the build error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker reports the container state as running, but the Tomcat logs show severe startup failures: a ClassFormatException when processing com/example/VulnAction.class, "Unable to process web resource" and subsequent "One or more Filters failed to start" and "Context [/struts2-demo] startup failed due to previous errors". These errors indicate the web application failed to deploy correctly, so the container is not functioning as intended.
	- ERROR: Docker reports the container state as running, but the Tomcat logs show severe startup failures: a ClassFormatException when processing com/example/VulnAction.class, "Unable to process web resource" and subsequent "One or more Filters failed to start" and "Context [/struts2-demo] startup failed due to previous errors". These errors indicate the web application failed to deploy correctly, so the container is not functioning as intended.
	- FIX: The startup failures are caused by the fact that the WAR contains a pre‑compiled VulnAction.class file (the binary under src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes) that conflicts with the class that Maven builds from src/main/java/com/example/VulnAction.java and is compiled for the wrong Java version, so Tomcat throws a ClassFormatException and aborts deployment. To fix it, delete the stray src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/com/example/VulnAction.class file (or any other copied‑in .class files) so that only the source file is compiled by Maven, and keep a single WEB‑INF/web.xml definition (remove the duplicate copy). After cleaning the source tree and rebuilding the WAR, the container will start successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running (State.Status=running) but the Tomcat logs show multiple SEVERE errors: a ClassFormatException while processing a web resource (VulnAction.class) and failures to start Filters, resulting in the web application context [/struts2-demo] failing to start. These errors indicate the application inside the container did not initialize correctly, so the container is not operating as intended.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running (State.Status=running) but the Tomcat logs show multiple SEVERE errors: a ClassFormatException while processing a web resource (VulnAction.class) and failures to start Filters, resulting in the web application context [/struts2-demo] failing to start. These errors indicate the application inside the container did not initialize correctly, so the container is not operating as intended.
	- FIX: The failures are caused by a Java‑version mismatch: the builder image uses JDK 11 while the Tomcat runtime image only provides a JRE 8, so the compiled VulnAction.class (byte‑code version 55) cannot be loaded by the Java 8 VM, producing the ClassFormatException and preventing the Struts filter from starting. To fix it, either change the builder stage to a JDK 8 image (for example `maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-8`) so that the classes are compiled for Java 8, or switch the runtime stage to a Tomcat image that runs on Java 11 (such as `tomcat:9-jdk11`) and adjust the `EXPOSE`/port mapping accordingly. After aligning the compile and runtime Java versions, the WAR will load successfully and the application context will start.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running (State.Running: true), but the Tomcat logs show multiple SEVERE errors indicating the web application failed to start. Specifically, a ClassFormatException for /WEB-INF/classes/com/example/VulnAction.class caused annotation processing to fail, and subsequent filter and context initialization errors prevented the /struts2-demo context from starting. These application‑level failures mean the container is not operating correctly despite the process being alive.
