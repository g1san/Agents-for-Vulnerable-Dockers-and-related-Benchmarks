    "desc": "CVE-2017-12636 is a critical vulnerability in Apache CouchDB that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host running the database. The flaw resides in CouchDB\u2019s handling of configuration parameters and design\u2011document processing. By supplying specially crafted HTTP requests or design documents, an attacker can cause the server to launch the CouchDB JavaScript engine (couchjs) or other configured binaries with the privileges of the CouchDB process. This results in remote code execution, enabling full system compromise. The vulnerability affects all CouchDB releases prior to the security\u2011fixed versions 1.7.1 and 2.1.1. Upgrading to at least those versions (or later) mitigates the issue.",
