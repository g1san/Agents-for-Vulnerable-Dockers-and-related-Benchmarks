    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111978 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.11. The flaw resides in the example Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that are installed by default when the configuration option `load_examples` is set to true. One of these example DAGs, `example_trigger_target_dag`, contains a BashOperator that executes a command supplied via the DAG run configuration. When the Airflow experimental REST API is enabled (the default in affected versions) an attacker can send an unauthenticated POST request to the endpoint `/api/experimental/dags/example_trigger_target_dag/dag_runs` with a JSON payload that injects an arbitrary shell command. The API forwards the payload to the DAG, the BashOperator runs the injected command on the Airflow worker host, and the attacker gains remote code execution with the privileges of the Airflow service account. The vulnerability can also be triggered by an authenticated user through the web UI or the stable REST API. Mitigation includes disabling example DAGs (`load_examples = False`) or upgrading to Apache Airflow 1.10.11 or any later release where the vulnerable example DAGs have been removed.",
