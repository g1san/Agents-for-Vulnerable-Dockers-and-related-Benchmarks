CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11978 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.11. The flaw resides in the example Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that are installed by default when the configuration option `load_examples` is set to true. One of these example DAGs, `example_trigger_target_dag`, contains a BashOperator that executes a command supplied via the DAG run configuration. When the Airflow experimental REST API is enabled (the default in affected versions) an attacker can send an unauthenticated POST request to the endpoint `/api/experimental/dags/example_trigger_target_dag/dag_runs` with a JSON payload that injects an arbitrary shell command. The API forwards the payload to the DAG, the BashOperator runs the injected command on the Airflow worker host, and the attacker gains remote code execution with the privileges of the Airflow service account. The vulnerability can also be triggered by an authenticated user through the web UI or the stable REST API. Mitigation includes disabling example DAGs (`load_examples = False`) or upgrading to Apache Airflow 1.10.11 or any later release where the vulnerable example DAGs have been removed.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines a 'web' service built from a PHP 7.2 Apache image and a 'db' service using the MySQL 5.7 image. Neither apache/airflow nor PostgreSQL are present, so the required services list ['apache/airflow', 'postgres'] is not satisfied. Additionally, the only Apache component used is the one bundled with the php:7.2-apache base image, which is not apache/airflow and therefore does not match any of the vulnerable versions ['1.10.0'‑'1.10.10'] specified for that service.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines a 'web' service built from a PHP 7.2 Apache image and a 'db' service using the MySQL 5.7 image. Neither apache/airflow nor PostgreSQL are present, so the required services list ['apache/airflow', 'postgres'] is not satisfied. Additionally, the only Apache component used is the one bundled with the php:7.2-apache base image, which is not apache/airflow and therefore does not match any of the vulnerable versions ['1.10.0'‑'1.10.10'] specified for that service.
	- FIX: To satisfy the service requirements you need to replace the current PHP‑Apache stack with an actual Airflow deployment and add a PostgreSQL container for metadata storage. In the docker‑compose.yml swap the web service for the official apache/airflow image (or build a custom image that runs Airflow) and change the db service to postgres:13 with the appropriate environment variables (POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB). Then configure Airflow’s airflow.cfg to point at the PostgreSQL instance (sql_alchemy_conn=postgresql://… ) and set load_examples=False to eliminate the vulnerable example DAGs. Finally, remove the insecure index.php script entirely, as it serves no purpose for an Airflow environment and would re‑introduce arbitrary command execution. With these changes the compose file contains the required apache/airflow and postgres services, and the vulnerable DAGs are disabled.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is probably failing because the Airflow image expects its metadata database to be initialized before the webserver starts, and the `command: webserver` line launches the web UI directly without running the required `airflow db init` (or the newer `airflow db upgrade`) step. To fix it, replace the plain `webserver` command with a short shell that first initializes the database and then starts the webserver, for example:

```yaml
command: bash -c "airflow db init && airflow webserver"
```

If you are using an Airflow version that still relies on the old CLI, you can use:

```yaml
command: bash -c "airflow initdb && airflow webserver"
```

Make sure the environment variable `AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN` matches the PostgreSQL service name (it already does) and that the Postgres container’s init script is being mounted correctly; the relative path `./postgres/init.sql` should resolve from the compose file’s directory, so verify the file is there. Once the database is properly initialized, the Airflow container will start without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow container is exiting because the single `airflow webserver` process never returns and the service never reaches a healthy state; with a SequentialExecutor you also need a scheduler process, otherwise the webserver will shut down after initialization. Change the `command` line to start both the scheduler and the webserver in the same container, for example: `command: bash -c "airflow db init && airflow scheduler & airflow webserver"`; this runs the database initialization once, launches the scheduler in the background, and then starts the web server so the container stays up and the dependent postgres service can become healthy. If you prefer to keep the processes separate, add a second service for the scheduler that uses the same image and shares the same environment variables, but the quickest fix is to run both processes together as shown.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the airflow service never becomes healthy is that the container’s entry‑point finishes before the web‑server is actually listening – the single‑quoted Bash line starts the scheduler in the background, then immediately runs airflow webserver but exits as soon as the web‑server process is spawned, so the health‑check hits a dead port. Change the command to keep the shell alive while both processes run, for example:  

```yaml
command: >
  bash -c "
    airflow db init &&
    airflow scheduler &
    exec airflow webserver
  "
```  

Using exec for the web‑server replaces the Bash process, guaranteeing the container stays up as long as the web‑server is running and allowing the health‑check (curl http://localhost:8080/health) to succeed. After this adjustment the airflow service should start correctly and pass its health‑check.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the *airflow* service never becomes healthy is that the web‑server starts before the metadata database is fully initialised, so the health‑check curl fails. Change the entry‑point command to wait for the database to be ready, run the DB migration, set the web‑server to listen on all interfaces, and then launch the scheduler and web‑server in the same foreground process; for example:

```yaml
command: >
  bash -c "
    until pg_isready -h postgres -U airflow; do echo 'waiting for postgres...'; sleep 2; done &&
    airflow db init &&
    export AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__WEB_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 &&
    airflow scheduler &
    exec airflow webserver
  "
```

This ensures the container only proceeds once Postgres is up, the metadata tables exist, and the web UI is reachable on `0.0.0.0:8080`, allowing the health‑check to succeed and the service to stay running. If the compose file’s relative path to `postgres/init.sql` is incorrect, move the file next to the compose file or use an absolute path so the Postgres container can mount it without error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the airflow service never comes up in this compose file is that the start‑up command uses the newer `airflow db init` CLI, which didn’t exist in the 1.10.10 image – the correct command for that version is `airflow initdb`. Replace the line that reads `airflow db init &&` with `airflow initdb &&` in the `command:` section. After that change the container will be able to initialise its metadata database, start the scheduler in the background and finally launch the webserver, allowing the health‑check to succeed and the service to run normally. Ensure the `init.sql` file is still mounted correctly (the relative path is fine as long as the file exists next to the compose file).


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is exiting because the `airflow initdb` command is no longer valid for the 1.10.10 image when it runs after the database is ready; it fails and the script ends, leaving nothing for the container to keep alive. Change the startup script so it runs the newer initialization command and only starts the web‑server after the scheduler is launched in the background. Replace the `command` section with a single `bash -c` that waits for PostgreSQL, runs `airflow db init` instead of `airflow initdb`, then starts the scheduler in the background and finally execs the web‑server; this keeps the main process alive and lets the health‑check succeed. After updating the command, re‑run `docker compose up -d` and the Airflow service should start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow container is crashing because the start‑up script uses the newer “airflow db init” command, which doesn’t exist in the 1.10.10 image; replace that line with the legacy “airflow initdb” (or upgrade the image to a newer Airflow version that supports the db command). After changing the `command:` block to run `airflow initdb && …` the service will initialize its metadata database correctly, allowing the scheduler and webserver to start and the health‑check to succeed. If you prefer to keep the newer command, bump the image tag to `apache/airflow:2.x` and adjust any other config differences accordingly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most likely reason the stack won’t start is the `depends_on` syntax – the `condition: service_healthy` option is only supported in legacy v2 compose files, not in the v3.8 format you’re using, so Docker Compose aborts parsing the file and never launches the services. Delete the `condition:` line (leaving a simple `depends_on: - postgres`) and the file will be valid again. While you’re editing the file, replace the deprecated `airflow initdb` call with the newer `airflow db init` command (which works the same in 1.10.x) and add a short `sleep` before the health‑check curl so the web server has time to bind; for example, change the `command:` block to run `airflow db init && sleep 5 && airflow scheduler & exec airflow webserver`. After those two tweaks the containers should come up cleanly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
