CVE description: CVE‑2018‑1000861 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Stapler web framework that is bundled with Jenkins core. Stapler incorrectly maps crafted HTTP request URLs to public Java methods (such as getters, do* methods, and other callable members) and invokes them via reflection. Because many internal Jenkins objects expose methods like java.lang.Runtime.exec, an unauthenticated attacker can construct a URL that triggers execution of arbitrary operating‑system commands on the Jenkins host. The vulnerability affects Jenkins core releases up to version 2.153 (weekly) and LTS releases up to version 2.138.3. Exploitation requires only HTTP access to the Jenkins web interface; no additional services are necessary. The impact is full remote code execution with the privileges of the Jenkins process, allowing attackers to install malware, create user accounts, invalidate sessions, or perform any action the Jenkins service can perform on the host.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][jenkins/jenkins][['2.153', '2.138.3']] Jenkins core (including the Stapler web framework) that contains the vulnerable method‑dispatch logic. The specified versions are the last releases before the security fix and are therefore vulnerable to CVE‑2018‑1000861.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the Dind service running you should add a persistent Docker data directory and make sure the daemon is started with the proper arguments; modify the compose file so that the service mounts a host directory (for example `- /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker`) and add a restart policy, then adjust the command to invoke the Docker daemon directly without the extra entrypoint wrapper, for example `command: ["dockerd","--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","--host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]`. This ensures the daemon has a writable state location and will be automatically restarted if it crashes, allowing the container to come up correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the image `docker:18.09.1-dind` already provides an entrypoint script that sets up the Docker daemon and expects to be run with its default command; overriding it with a raw `dockerd` call bypasses that initialization and leaves the daemon without required options (for example the socket‑forwarding setup). Remove the custom `command:` line from the compose file so the image’s built‑in entrypoint can start the daemon, or explicitly invoke the entrypoint script in the command (e.g. `command: ["dockerd-entrypoint.sh", "dockerd", "--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "--host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]`). After restoring the proper entrypoint the container will launch correctly and expose the daemon on port 2375.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the dind service running you should tell the container to start the Docker daemon on the TCP socket it’s exposing and avoid mounting the host’s Docker data directory directly. In the compose file add a command that runs dockerd with -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 and keep the default Unix socket, for example: command: ["dockerd","-H","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","-H","unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]; also replace the host‑path volume with a named volume (or remove it entirely) so the container can manage its own /var/lib/docker storage, and you can drop the privileged flag because the dind image already runs with the needed capabilities. After these changes rebuild and bring the stack up again.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The dind service is failing because the Docker daemon inside the image needs elevated privileges to create its own storage driver and control cgroups; add privileged: true to the service definition (or at least expose the required devices and set security_opt: –privileged) and ensure the host’s kernel modules for overlay2 or aufs are available. You should also remove the empty DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR assignment (or set it to /var/run/docker) so the daemon can start without TLS errors, and confirm that the host port 2375 is not already bound by another process. After updating the docker‑compose.yml with the privileged flag and correcting the environment variable, rebuild (docker‑compose build) and restart the stack; the dind container should then launch the inner Docker daemon and stay up.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the dind service starts the Docker‑in‑Docker image without telling the daemon to listen on the TCP socket you exposed (2375), so the container boots but the Docker API remains unavailable and the service appears to be “not running”. To fix it, change the compose file (or the Dockerfile) so that the dind container is started with an explicit dockerd command that binds the TCP port, and disable TLS if you really want plain‑text access. For example, add a command line such as `dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375` (or set the environment variable `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` to turn off TLS) in the compose service definition, and optionally remove the redundant `EXPOSE` and `VOLUME` directives from the Dockerfile (the base image already declares them). After updating the compose file with that command and recreating the stack (`docker compose up -d --force-recreate`), the dind container will start the Docker daemon listening on port 2375 and the service will run correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely fails because the dind service is trying to bind the Docker daemon to both a Unix socket and the insecure TCP port 2375, but the Docker image you are using (docker:18.09.1-dind) expects the socket path /var/run/docker.sock to be managed internally and does not need the host‑mounted cgroup directory; mounting /sys/fs/cgroup as read‑only can also cause permission issues on some hosts. To fix it, simplify the command to start the daemon only on the TCP listener (e.g., command: ["dockerd","-H","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","--storage-driver=overlay2"]) and remove the cgroup volume mount. Also ensure the privileged flag remains so the inner Docker can run, and keep the DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR variable empty to disable TLS for the exposed port. After adjusting the docker‑compose.yml accordingly and rebuilding the image, the dind container should start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the custom `command` overrides the default entrypoint that already starts the Docker daemon with the right options, and the cgroup bind‑mount isn’t needed for a typical dind setup. Change the compose file so the service simply uses the image’s built‑in entrypoint (remove the `command:` line), keep the privileged flag, expose port 2375, set `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` to disable TLS, and mount only the persistent `/var/lib/docker` volume (drop the `/sys/fs/cgroup` bind‑mount). In the Dockerfile you can also drop the redundant `VOLUME /var/lib/docker` line, since the compose file already defines the volume. After these adjustments the dind container should start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container isn’t starting because the Docker‑in‑Docker image expects its entrypoint to launch the daemon, but the compose file never tells it to do so; add a command that runs the dockerd entrypoint on the TCP port you expose. In the compose file replace the empty service definition with something like:

```yaml
services:
  dind:
    build: .
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=
    ports:
      - "2375:2375"
    volumes:
      - dind-data:/var/lib/docker
    command: ["dockerd-entrypoint.sh","--host","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","--host","unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
    restart: unless-stopped
```

This forces the image’s built‑in script to start the Docker daemon listening on the exposed port, after which the container should come up normally. No other changes to the Dockerfile are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The dind service is failing because the Docker daemon inside the image expects a writable /var/lib/docker directory and a proper cgroup mount, but the compose file only mounts the data volume and the host cgroup read‑only; the daemon also needs a valid init process to reap zombies. Fix it by adding a bind‑mount for the host’s /var/run/docker.sock so the inner daemon can communicate with the outer Docker, and change the command to start the daemon in the foreground with a compatible storage driver, for example:

replace the command line with ["dockerd-entrypoint.sh","--host","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","--host","unix:///var/run/docker.sock","--storage-driver","overlay2","--log-level","info"] and add a volumes entry - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock. This gives the inner Docker daemon the necessary socket and storage driver, allowing the container to start and stay running.
