    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111000861 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Stapler web framework that is bundled with Jenkins core. Stapler incorrectly maps crafted HTTP request URLs to public Java methods (such as getters, do* methods, and other callable members) and invokes them via reflection. Because many internal Jenkins objects expose methods like java.lang.Runtime.exec, an unauthenticated attacker can construct a URL that triggers execution of arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the Jenkins host. The vulnerability affects Jenkins core releases up to version 2.153 (weekly) and LTS releases up to version 2.138.3. Exploitation requires only HTTP access to the Jenkins web interface; no additional services are necessary. The impact is full remote code execution with the privileges of the Jenkins process, allowing attackers to install malware, create user accounts, invalidate sessions, or perform any action the Jenkins service can perform on the host.",
