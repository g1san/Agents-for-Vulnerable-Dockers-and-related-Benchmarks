    "desc": "Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.1 contains an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE\u201122). The HTTP/HTTPS interface allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP GET request that includes directory\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\"). The server fails to properly sanitize the path, enabling the request to escape the web\u2011root and read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. The flaw can be exploited remotely without authentication or user interaction, resulting in high\u2011severity disclosure of confidential data such as configuration files, source code, or credentials. No privilege escalation or code execution is required, but the exposure of sensitive files can lead to further compromise. The vulnerability affects all installations of GlassFish 4.1 and is identified as CVE\u20112017\u20111000028.",
