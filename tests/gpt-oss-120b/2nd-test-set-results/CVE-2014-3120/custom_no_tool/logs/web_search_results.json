    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20113120 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Elasticsearch. In versions prior to 1.2.3 the default configuration enables dynamic scripting (MVEL/Java). An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `_search` API with a `source` parameter that contains arbitrary MVEL expressions or Java code. Elasticsearch evaluates this code inside the server process, allowing the attacker to execute any command on the host operating system. The vulnerability requires no credentials, no user interaction and can be triggered over the network if the Elasticsearch HTTP port (default 9200) is reachable. Successful exploitation grants the attacker full control of the Elasticsearch node and any resources the process can access, potentially compromising the entire host and other services running on it.",
