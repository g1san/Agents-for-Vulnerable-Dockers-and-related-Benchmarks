----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2014‑3120 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Elasticsearch. In versions prior to 1.2.3 the default configuration enables dynamic scripting (MVEL/Java). An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `_search` API with a `source` parameter that contains arbitrary MVEL expressions or Java code. Elasticsearch evaluates this code inside the server process, allowing the attacker to execute any command on the host operating system. The vulnerability requires no credentials, no user interaction and can be triggered over the network if the Elasticsearch HTTP port (default 9200) is reachable. Successful exploitation grants the attacker full control of the Elasticsearch node and any resources the process can access, potentially compromising the entire host and other services running on it.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][elasticsearch][['1.1.0', '1.1.1', '1.1.2', '1.2.0', '1.2.1', '1.2.2']] Vulnerable Elasticsearch server that contains the dynamic‑scripting flaw exploited by CVE‑2014‑3120.
- [SOFT-DB][docker][['20.10.24']] Docker Engine required to run the Elasticsearch container and provide the isolated environment for testing the vulnerability.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup defines two services: 'web' (a Python Flask app) and 'db' (MySQL 5.7). Neither service runs Elasticsearch, nor is any Docker‑related service listed. Therefore the required services ['elasticsearch', 'docker'] are not present, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail. Additionally, because Elasticsearch is not used, no vulnerable Elasticsearch version from the provided list can be detected, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup defines two services: 'web' (a Python Flask app) and 'db' (MySQL 5.7). Neither service runs Elasticsearch, nor is any Docker‑related service listed. Therefore the required services ['elasticsearch', 'docker'] are not present, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail. Additionally, because Elasticsearch is not used, no vulnerable Elasticsearch version from the provided list can be detected, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- FIX: Add an Elasticsearch service to the compose file using a vulnerable tag such as docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:1.2.2, expose its 9200 port, and set the network so the Flask container can reach it (e.g., environment variable ES_HOST=elasticsearch). Then modify the Flask app to import the Python Elasticsearch client (pip install elasticsearch) and replace the unsafe eval endpoint with a call that forwards the supplied query to http://$ES_HOST:9200/_search using the source parameter, thereby reproducing CVE‑2014‑3120 while keeping the MySQL service unchanged. This brings the required “elasticsearch” service into the stack and satisfies the version‑check milestone.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the python:3.8‑slim image does not provide a python binary – it only ships python3, so the container can’t start the Flask app with CMD ["python", "app.py"]. Change the Dockerfile’s last line to use the correct executable (for example CMD ["python3", "app.py"] or replace the base image with python:3.8 which includes the python symlink). After that the image will build and run successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the pip install step in the web Dockerfile tries to pull the latest elasticsearch client, which no longer supports the old 1.x Elasticsearch server you’re running and also brings in compiled dependencies that aren’t present in the slim image. Edit ./web/Dockerfile so that it upgrades pip and pins a client version that works with Elasticsearch 1.2.2 (for example elasticsearch==5.5.3) and, if you need any compiled wheels, install the minimal build tools first. A one‑line change such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install flask pymysql "elasticsearch==5.5.3" requests` will satisfy the dependencies and let the image build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim Python image does not have the compilation tools and headers required to build the Elasticsearch client (and any other packages that need native extensions), so the “gcc” install alone is insufficient. Add the full build‑essential suite and the Python development headers before running pip, then clean up the apt cache to keep the image small; for example, change the Dockerfile to run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc python3-dev build-essential && pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && pip install flask pymysql "elasticsearch==5.5.3" requests` and finish with `apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. This ensures all native extensions can compile and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build blows up while assembling the Flask image because the current python:3.8‑slim base does not contain the libraries required to compile the Python dependencies (the elasticsearch client pulls in native extensions that need the full Debian tool‑chain and dev headers). To fix it, switch the base to a fuller Debian‑based tag (for example python:3.8‑buster) and install the missing development packages before running pip. In practice you would change the first line of Dockerfile to `FROM python:3.8-buster` (and keep the existing apt‑get install line or add any additional libs such as libffi-dev or libssl-dev if needed). Once the image is built on a non‑slim distro the rest of the Docker‑compose stack can start normally.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install the Python Elasticsearch client version 5.5.3, which depends on newer libraries that aren’t compatible with the Debian buster base used by the python 3.8 image; switching to a client version that matches the old Elasticsearch 1.2.2 server (for example elasticsearch==2.4.0) resolves the dependency errors. You can fix it by editing the Dockerfile to replace the line that installs the client with `pip install --no-cache-dir "elasticsearch==2.4.0"` (or simply remove the client if it isn’t needed), then rebuild the image. After that change the build should complete without errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to install a modern Elasticsearch Python client (2.4.0) on top of a very old Elasticsearch 1.2.2 server, which pulls in dependencies that aren’t compatible with the buster base image and causes apt‑ or pip‑resolution errors; to fix it you should replace the “elasticsearch==2.4.0” line with a client version that matches the server (for example elasticsearch==1.9.0) and simplify the package install step so only the runtime libraries are added—e.g. run apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev (and drop the duplicated gcc/build‑essential packages), then install the Python requirements in a separate pip install command; this resolves the dependency clash and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the elasticsearch Python client version 1.9.0 that the Dockerfile installs is not compatible with the Python 3.8 runtime used in the python:3.8‑buster base image; it expects an older interpreter and pulls in dependencies that cannot be compiled. To fix it, change the base image to a Python version that the client supports (for example python:2.7‑buster or python:3.7‑buster) or, more cleanly, switch the client library to a newer release that works with Python 3.8 (such as elasticsearch==5.5.0 or later). After updating either the base image or the pip install line, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Python packages pulled in by `pip install flask pymysql requests` need to compile native extensions (for example, the `cryptography` dependency used by `requests`) and the image only installs the runtime libraries (`libffi-dev` and `libssl-dev`). Adding a compiler tool‑chain solves the problem; simply extend the `apt‑get install` line in the `web/Dockerfile` to include `build-essential` (and optionally `python3-dev`), then keep the cleanup steps as‑is. After that the image will compile the required wheels and the Docker compose stack will start without errors.
