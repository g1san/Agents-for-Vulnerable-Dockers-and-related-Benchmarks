    "desc": "CVE-2017-12794 is a vulnerability in the Django web framework that affects the built\u2011in technical 500 debug page. When the Django setting DEBUG is set to True, unhandled exceptions cause Django to render a detailed debug page that includes information about the exception cause. In affected Django versions (1.10.x prior to 1.10.8 and 1.11.x prior to 1.11.5), the template that renders the exception cause disables HTML auto\u2011escaping for the variable `frame.exc_cause`. If an attacker can trigger an exception whose cause contains attacker\u2011controlled data\u2014commonly by causing a database integrity error with a crafted value\u2014the malicious data is reflected in the debug page without being escaped, resulting in execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim\u2019s browser. This is a classic reflected cross\u2011site scripting scenario. The impact includes theft of session cookies, credential capture, and any actions that the logged\u2011in user can perform within the vulnerable Django application. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading Django to a version that includes the September\u202f2017 security patch (\u2265\u202f1.10.8, \u2265\u202f1.11.5, or any later 2.x/3.x release) and by ensuring that DEBUG is set to False in production environments.",
