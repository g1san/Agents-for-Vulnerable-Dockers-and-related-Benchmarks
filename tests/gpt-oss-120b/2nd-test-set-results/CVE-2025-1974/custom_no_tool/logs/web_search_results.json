    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u20111974 is a critical vulnerability in the Ingress\u2011NGINX controller used in Kubernetes clusters. The admission webhook component of the controller processes unauthenticated AdmissionReview requests and generates temporary NGINX configuration files. Insufficient sanitisation of data that is injected into these configuration files (through annotations, UID, or other Ingress fields) allows an attacker to insert malicious NGINX directives such as `ssl_engine` that load an attacker\u2011controlled shared library. When the controller invokes `nginx -t` to validate the configuration, the malicious library is loaded and executed inside the controller pod. Because the controller runs with a service\u2011account that has read access to all cluster Secrets, the attacker can also exfiltrate TLS certificates, credentials and any other secret stored in the cluster. Exploitation requires only network connectivity to the pod network; no prior authentication or additional compromised services are needed. The vulnerability affects all default installations of Ingress\u2011NGINX that enable the validating admission webhook.",
