----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2025‑1974 is a critical vulnerability in the Ingress‑NGINX controller used in Kubernetes clusters. The admission webhook component of the controller processes unauthenticated AdmissionReview requests and generates temporary NGINX configuration files. Insufficient sanitisation of data that is injected into these configuration files (through annotations, UID, or other Ingress fields) allows an attacker to insert malicious NGINX directives such as `ssl_engine` that load an attacker‑controlled shared library. When the controller invokes `nginx -t` to validate the configuration, the malicious library is loaded and executed inside the controller pod. Because the controller runs with a service‑account that has read access to all cluster Secrets, the attacker can also exfiltrate TLS certificates, credentials and any other secret stored in the cluster. Exploitation requires only network connectivity to the pod network; no prior authentication or additional compromised services are needed. The vulnerability affects all default installations of Ingress‑NGINX that enable the validating admission webhook.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The web container is likely failing during the npm install step because the Alpine‑based Node image doesn’t include the C‑toolchain and Python needed to compile the native bindings used by the mysql module, so the build aborts and the container exits. Change the Dockerfile to use a non‑Alpine base (for example FROM node:14‑slim) or, if you want to stay on Alpine, add a RUN apk add --no‑cache make gcc g++ python3 before the npm install command so the native module can be compiled. After fixing the build you may also want to add a simple health‑check or a “wait‑for‑db” script that pauses the Node start‑up until MySQL is ready, but the immediate problem is the missing build dependencies in the image.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is stuck in a loop waiting for MySQL because the 'wait-for-db.sh' script cannot find the 'nc' (netcat) command. STDERR repeatedly reports '/app/wait-for-db.sh: nc: not found', causing the script to endlessly output 'Waiting for MySQL at db:3306...'. As a result, the service does not start successfully even though Docker reports the container as running.

As a result, the service does not start successfully even though Docker reports the container as running.
	- FIX: Add the netcat utility to the web image so the script can reach the MySQL host: in ./web/Dockerfile insert a line after the npm install step such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. This installs the `nc` command that wait‑for‑db.sh expects, allowing the loop to detect when MySQL is listening and then exec node app.js. After rebuilding and redeploying the containers the web service will start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the docker‑compose.yml uses the v3 syntax but still includes the deprecated condition key under depends_on — Docker Compose 3.x doesn’t recognise that option and aborts with a validation error. To fix it, change the file to version '2.4' or higher (for example '2.4') so that the condition: service_healthy directive is allowed, or simply drop the condition line and keep depends_on: - db since the healthcheck already defined for the MySQL service will ensure the container is ready before the web container starts. After removing or adjusting that unsupported option the images will build and start without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker setup defines only two services: 'web' built from a Node.js base image (node:14-bullseye) and 'db' using the mysql:5.7 image. No service references the image k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller, so the required service is missing, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail. Because none of the images used match any of the listed vulnerable versions of k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller, the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.

Because none of the images used match any of the listed vulnerable versions of k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller, the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- FIX: Add a new service (for example named ingress‑controller) to the docker‑compose.yml that pulls the vulnerable k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller image at one of the listed versions (e.g., v1.10.9) and expose the controller’s webhook port (usually 8443 or 443) so the rest of the stack can reach it. Then make the web service depend on this new service (or adjust any host‑name references) so the compose file creates the required component, which will satisfy both the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones. Optionally you can remove the placeholder comment and ensure the controller runs with its default configuration so the CVE‑specific admission webhook is active.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `apt-get install -y netcat` line can’t find a package named `netcat` on the Bullseye‑based Node image – the package is called `netcat-openbsd` (or `netcat-traditional`). Change the Dockerfile so the package manager installs the correct netcat package; for example replace the faulty line with `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. After that the image will build successfully and the rest of the stack can start.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the web Dockerfile tries to install a package that isn’t available in the Bullseye repository under the name netcat-openbsd; replace that line with a generic netcat install (for example apt‑get install -y netcat) and keep the cleanup step, then make sure the wait‑for‑db.sh script is copied after the apt‑get command and has its executable flag set (the existing chmod line is fine). Also, the COPY package*.json instruction will succeed even if only package.json exists, so no change is needed there. Once the package name is corrected and the script is guaranteed to be executable, the image builds without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the container tries to use the `nc` command but the package installed (`netcat`) does not provide the `nc` binary on the Bullseye base image; installing the correct package (`netcat-openbsd`) resolves the missing command. Update the Dockerfile to run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, keep the `chmod +x /app/wait-for-db.sh` line, and change the final command to launch the script directly (for example `CMD ["/app/wait-for-db.sh"]`). This ensures the wait‑for‑db script can execute, the image builds successfully, and the Node app starts after the database becomes reachable.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the `wait‑for‑db.sh` script is being used as the container’s entry point, but the script expects the `nc` (netcat) binary and the Node runtime to be available **after** the package install step; the current `apt‑get` line removes the package list before the install finishes, so `nc` can’t be found when the script runs. The quickest fix is to rearrange the Dockerfile so the package list is kept until after netcat is installed and then clean it up, and to launch the Node app directly from the script (or from `npm start`). One way to do it is to change the Dockerfile to run `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y netcat-openbsd && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` **after** copying the source files, and replace the final `CMD` line with `CMD ["/app/wait-for-db.sh"]` (the script already execs `node app.js`). This ensures netcat is present when the script checks MySQL, and the container starts the Node process correctly, eliminating the build‑time error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The Docker build fails because the base image `node:14‑bullseye` no longer contains the `netcat-openbsd` package in its default repository, so the `apt‑get install` step aborts. Replace the base with a still‑supported variant that includes the needed package (for example `node:14‑bullseye‑slim` or upgrade to a newer LTS like `node:18‑bullseye`) and then run the install, or add the Debian‑backports repository before installing netcat. After updating the `FROM` line in `web/Dockerfile` to a valid image and re‑running `docker compose build`, the image builds successfully.
