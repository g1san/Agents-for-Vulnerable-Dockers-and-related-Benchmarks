{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-7525 is a deserialization vulnerability in the Jackson Databind library. The flaw exists in the ObjectMapper when default typing is enabled. An attacker can supply a crafted JSON payload that specifies arbitrary class names, causing Jackson to instantiate those classes during deserialization. This can lead to execution of attacker\u2011controlled code on any Java application that includes a vulnerable Jackson Databind version and processes untrusted JSON with default typing enabled. The vulnerability requires no authentication and does not depend on any additional services. It is mitigated by upgrading to a patched Jackson Databind release or by disabling default typing entirely.",
