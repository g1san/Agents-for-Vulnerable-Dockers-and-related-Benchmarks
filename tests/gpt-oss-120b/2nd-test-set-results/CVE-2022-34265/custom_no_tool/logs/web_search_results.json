{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201134265 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Django's ORM functions `Trunc()` and `Extract()`. The functions accept a *kind* (for `Trunc`) or *lookup_name* (for `Extract`) argument that is interpolated directly into the generated SQL statement without proper sanitisation. An attacker who can control this argument via an HTTP request parameter can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing reading, modification, or deletion of data, as well as triggering time\u2011based or other denial\u2011of\u2011service payloads. The flaw affects Django versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.13 and 4.0.0 through 4.0.5. It is patched in Django 3.2.14, 4.0.6 and later.",
