CVE description: CVE‑2021‑40438 is a critical Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server (httpd) when the **mod_proxy** module is enabled. The flaw resides in the way mod_proxy parses the request‑URI when building the target URL for a proxied request. An attacker can supply a crafted URI that contains an arbitrary scheme such as "unix:" or any other scheme, causing the server to construct a proxy URL that points to a location chosen by the attacker. As a result, the vulnerable Apache instance acts as an open proxy and forwards the request to any internal or external host. This can be used to bypass IP‑based access controls, exfiltrate secrets from internal services, perform request smuggling, amplify denial‑of‑service attacks, or pivot deeper into a network. The vulnerability is present in all Apache HTTP Server releases up to and including version 2.4.48. It is fixed starting with version 2.4.49, which tightens the parsing logic to only accept the "unix:" scheme at the beginning of the URL. Mitigations include upgrading to Apache httpd 2.4.49 or later, disabling the mod_proxy module when it is not required, and applying configuration hardening to reject non‑HTTP schemes in proxy forward URLs.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the container running you should make sure the directory that holds the downloadable files exists when the Flask process starts; add a line in the Dockerfile such as `RUN mkdir -p /app/files` after the `WORKDIR` declaration so the mount point is always present, and adjust the code to reference the same absolute path (e.g., `BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'files'))` and then build the file path from `BASE_DIR`). With the folder guaranteed at build time and the path resolved deterministically the app will start correctly and the /download endpoint will be able to locate the test file.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration builds a Python Flask application using the base image python:3.9-slim. No httpd (Apache) service is defined or installed in the Dockerfile, docker‑compose file, or image metadata, and therefore there is no httpd version to compare against the list of vulnerable versions. Consequently, the image does not use a vulnerable httpd version (code_hard_version = false) and does not provide the required httpd service (services_ok = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration builds a Python Flask application using the base image python:3.9-slim. No httpd (Apache) service is defined or installed in the Dockerfile, docker‑compose file, or image metadata, and therefore there is no httpd version to compare against the list of vulnerable versions. Consequently, the image does not use a vulnerable httpd version (code_hard_version = false) and does not provide the required httpd service (services_ok = false).
	- FIX: To make the composition satisfy the service check you need to add an Apache HTTP Server container (or install httpd inside the existing image) and configure it with mod_proxy enabled, then pin the Apache version to 2.4.49 or newer so the image is not flagged as vulnerable. In practice you would extend the Dockerfile to install the appropriate httpd packages (e.g. apt‑get install apache2=2.4.49-… and a2enmod proxy proxy_http) and expose port 80, or create a separate service in ​docker‑compose.yml​ that runs the official httpd:2.4.49‑slim​ image. Once an httpd service with a non‑vulnerable version is present, code_hard_version will evaluate to true and services_ok will be satisfied. If you do not actually need Apache, the simpler fix is to remove any references to httpd from the assessment criteria, because the current Flask‑only stack cannot be vulnerable to CVE‑2021‑40438.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile for the Apache service references a non‑existent tag – `httpd:2.4.49-slim` isn’t published in the official repository, so Docker can’t pull the base image. Change the `FROM` line to a valid tag such as `httpd:2.4.49` (or `httpd:2.4.49-bullseye` if you prefer a slimmer Debian base) and the image will pull correctly; the rest of the Dockerfile can stay the same, and the compose file will then be able to build and start both containers without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Dockerfile for the Apache service references a tag that isn’t available in the registry ( `httpd:2.4.49‑bullseye` ). Change the base‑image line to a tag that actually exists—for example, replace  

```Dockerfile
FROM httpd:2.4.49-bullseye
```  

with  

```Dockerfile
FROM httpd:2.4.54-bullseye   # or simply FROM httpd:latest
```  

After updating the tag, the `docker‑compose build` step will pull a valid image and the subsequent `RUN echo …` commands will execute without error, allowing the composition to start normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The httpd image is built from httpd:2.4.54-bullseye, exposing HTTPD_VERSION=2.4.54 in its environment. This version is not present in the allowed list of vulnerable httpd versions (which ends at 2.4.48), so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. The docker-compose file does include the required httpd service, so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.
	- ERROR: The httpd image is built from httpd:2.4.54-bullseye, exposing HTTPD_VERSION=2.4.54 in its environment. This version is not present in the allowed list of vulnerable httpd versions (which ends at 2.4.48), so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. The docker-compose file does include the required httpd service, so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you need to build the httpd service from a vulnerable release rather than 2.4.54. Change the httpd/Dockerfile to use httpd:2.4.48‑bullseye (or any version ≤ 2.4.48) as the base image, then rebuild the compose stack. This aligns the HTTPD_VERSION environment variable with the allowed list and fulfills the version‑hardening requirement. (Optionally, after testing, you would upgrade to a patched version and remove the open‑proxy configuration.)


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to patch the Apache configuration by chaining a series of `echo … >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf` commands; in the official httpd image the configuration file is owned by root and the layer‑by‑layer `&& echo` sequence is error‑prone, especially when the shell interprets the embedded quotes. The quick fix is to replace those inline `echo` statements with a single, pre‑written configuration snippet that you copy into the container, and then make sure the file has the correct permissions before the `EXPOSE` line. In practice you would create a small `proxy.conf` (containing the `LoadModule` lines, `ProxyRequests On`, and the `<Proxy "*">…</Proxy>` block), add a line like `COPY proxy.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/` and then add an `Include /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/proxy.conf` to the main `httpd.conf` (or simply replace the whole file with `COPY httpd.conf …`). This removes the fragile echo chain, guarantees the syntax is correct, and lets the image build successfully.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
