    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201140438 is a critical Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server (httpd) when the **mod_proxy** module is enabled. The flaw resides in the way mod_proxy parses the request\u2011URI when building the target URL for a proxied request. An attacker can supply a crafted URI that contains an arbitrary scheme such as \"unix:\" or any other scheme, causing the server to construct a proxy URL that points to a location chosen by the attacker. As a result, the vulnerable Apache instance acts as an open proxy and forwards the request to any internal or external host. This can be used to bypass IP\u2011based access controls, exfiltrate secrets from internal services, perform request smuggling, amplify denial\u2011of\u2011service attacks, or pivot deeper into a network. The vulnerability is present in all Apache HTTP Server releases up to and including version 2.4.48. It is fixed starting with version 2.4.49, which tightens the parsing logic to only accept the \"unix:\" scheme at the beginning of the URL. Mitigations include upgrading to Apache httpd 2.4.49 or later, disabling the mod_proxy module when it is not required, and applying configuration hardening to reject non\u2011HTTP schemes in proxy forward URLs.",
