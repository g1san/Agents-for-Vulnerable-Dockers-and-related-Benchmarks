CVE description: CVE‑2017‑3066 is a critical Java deserialization vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the Apache BlazeDS library that is bundled with ColdFusion and is used for processing AMF (Action Message Format) messages. When ColdFusion receives a crafted AMF payload, the vulnerable BlazeDS code deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, allowing an attacker to instantiate arbitrary Java objects. This results in remote code execution, giving the attacker full control of the affected host. The vulnerability affects ColdFusion 10 Update 22 and earlier, ColdFusion 11 Update 11 and earlier, and ColdFusion 2016 Update 3 and earlier. No additional services are required to exploit the flaw; an attacker only needs network access to the ColdFusion endpoint that processes BlazeDS messages (e.g., /messagebroker/amf).
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][adobe/coldfusion][['10u22']] Vulnerable Adobe ColdFusion 10 Update 22 that includes the flawed BlazeDS library enabling the deserialization vulnerability.
- [HARD][adobe/coldfusion][['11u11']] Vulnerable Adobe ColdFusion 11 Update 11 that includes the flawed BlazeDS library enabling the deserialization vulnerability.
- [HARD][adobe/coldfusion][['2016u3']] Vulnerable Adobe ColdFusion 2016 Update 3 that includes the flawed BlazeDS library enabling the deserialization vulnerability.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['latest']] Web server used to expose the ColdFusion service over HTTP/HTTPS; required for Docker networking but not part of the vulnerability itself.

	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `php:5.5‑apache` image is no longer available on Docker Hub, so the Dockerfile can’t find the base layer; switch to a supported tag (for example `php:7.4‑apache` or another currently‑maintained version) and add an `apt‑get update` step before installing the mysqli extension, then run `docker-php-ext-install mysqli && docker-php-ext-enable mysqli`. Updating the base image and ensuring the extension install runs after the package index is refreshed will allow the web service image to be built successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition includes only a PHP‑Apache web service built from php:7.4-apache and a MySQL 5.7 database. No adobe/coldfusion image is used, therefore none of the required ColdFusion versions (10u22, 11u11, 2016u3) are present. Additionally, the required nginx service is not defined in docker-compose.yml.

Additionally, the required nginx service is not defined in docker-compose.yml.
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch, replace the PHP‑Apache service with a container that runs a supported Adobe ColdFusion version (for example, using an official or custom adobe/coldfusion:10u22, 11u11, or 2016u3 image) and mount the vulnerable BlazeDS‑enabled web application into its /var/www/html directory; then add an Nginx service that proxies HTTP traffic to the ColdFusion container on the appropriate port, updating the compose file’s depends_on and ports sections accordingly, while keeping the MySQL service unchanged for any backend data needs. This aligns the stack with the CVE’s required components and eliminates the irrelevant PHP‑Apache service.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the ColdFusion image you reference (“adobe/coldfusion:10u22”) does not exist on Docker Hub, so Docker cannot pull it, and the Nginx build can’t find the configuration file because the Dockerfile copies “default.conf” from the build context but the file lives one directory deeper. To fix it, either create a local ColdFusion image (for example by adding a Dockerfile under ./coldfusion that starts FROM a supported base such as adobe/coldfusion:latest or openjdk and installs the 10u22 binaries), or replace the image name with a publicly‑available tag that actually exists. Then, move default.conf into the same directory as the Nginx Dockerfile or change the COPY instruction to COPY nginx/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf so the file is found during the build. After those two adjustments the compose file will build and start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container’s state reports it as running, but the logs are full of "sh: 1: nc: not found" errors. The entrypoint command relies on the `nc` (netcat) utility to open a listener on port 8500 and proxy requests to the Tomcat service. Because `nc` is not installed in the image, each iteration of the loop fails, resulting in a non‑functional service despite the container process staying alive. Hence the container is not running correctly.

Because `nc` is not installed in the image, each iteration of the loop fails, resulting in a non‑functional service despite the container process staying alive. Hence the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Install the missing netcat binary in the ColdFusion image (for example by adding “apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd” to the Dockerfile before the CMD line) so the “nc -l -p 8500” listener can be created, or replace the custom loop with a proper reverse‑proxy configuration (e.g., run Tomcat on 8500 directly or use an nginx container) and remove the reliance on netcat entirely; either approach resolves the “sh: 1: nc: not found” errors and makes the service respond correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but its main command repeatedly fails. The logs show repeated "nc: invalid option -- 'c'" errors when attempting to start a netcat listener with the -c option, which is not supported by the installed nc version. This prevents the intended curl forwarding loop from working, indicating the container is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running, but its main command repeatedly fails. The logs show repeated "nc: invalid option -- 'c'" errors when attempting to start a netcat listener with the -c option, which is not supported by the installed nc version. This prevents the intended curl forwarding loop from working, indicating the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: Fix the problem by getting rid of the “nc ‑c” construct, which the OpenBSD netcat package in the image does not support. The simplest change is to replace the CMD line in the ColdFusion Dockerfile with a loop that uses netcat’s supported options, for example: 

```dockerfile
CMD sh -c "catalina.sh run & while true; do curl -s http://localhost:8080 | nc -l -p 8500 -q 1; done"
``` 

Alternatively you can drop the proxy logic entirely, expose Tomcat’s native 8080 port, and let the nginx service forward to http://coldfusion:8080 instead of http://coldfusion:8500; in that case the CMD can be just `CMD ["catalina.sh","run"]`. Either approach removes the invalid “‑c” flag and restores normal container start‑up.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not use any of the listed Adobe ColdFusion images/versions. The 'coldfusion' service is built from a custom Dockerfile based on tomcat:8.5-jre8, which is not an Adobe ColdFusion image and therefore does not match any of the required versions (10u22, 11u11, 2016u3). Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails. Additionally, the required service list contains three entries for 'adobe/coldfusion' and one for 'nginx'. While an 'nginx' service is present, no 'adobe/coldfusion' service is used, so the 'services_ok' milestone also fails. The explanation covers both missing ColdFusion version and missing required services.

	- FIX: Replace the custom coldfusion service with an image that actually runs Adobe ColdFusion 10 Update 22 (or 11 Update 11 or 2016 Update 3) – for example adobe/coldfusion:10u22 or the appropriate tag – and remove the Tomcat‑based Dockerfile and its proxy command. In docker‑compose.yml set the coldfusion service to image: adobe/coldfusion:10u22 (and, if you need to cover the other two versions, add separate services or use a single service with the required version tag), expose the native ColdFusion AMF port 8500 directly, and keep the existing nginx service pointing to http://coldfusion:8500. This aligns the service name and version with the required adobe/coldfusion entries, satisfying both the code_hard_version and services_ok milestones.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the ColdFusion Dockerfile tries to forward traffic from port 8500 to Tomcat’s native 8080 with a custom curl | nc loop, and the `nc` flags (`-l -p … -q 1`) aren’t supported by the netcat‑openbsd package in the base image, causing the container to exit immediately. The simplest fix is to drop that proxy logic altogether: let Tomcat listen on its default 8080, expose that port in the compose file, and change the nginx `proxy_pass` to `http://coldfusion:8080`. In the ColdFusion Dockerfile you can replace the complex `CMD` with the standard `CMD ["catalina.sh","run"]`, remove the netcat installation (or keep it if you need it for other health checks), and delete the `EXPOSE 8080` mapping to 8500 – the compose `expose` line can be updated to `"8080"` or omitted since the network is internal. Adjusting the ports in both the compose file and nginx config aligns everything and eliminates the unsupported netcat invocation, allowing the images to build and run correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines a 'coldfusion' service, but its Dockerfile builds from tomcat:8.5-jre8, not from any adobe/coldfusion image. Consequently none of the required Adobe ColdFusion versions (10u22, 11u11, 2016u3) are present, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails. Additionally, the set of services used is {coldfusion (tomcat‑based), nginx, mysql}, which does not match the required list that includes three instances of 'adobe/coldfusion' and an nginx service. Therefore the 'services_ok' milestone also fails.

Therefore the 'services_ok' milestone also fails.
	- FIX: Replace the current coldfusion service with one (or three) services that pull an official Adobe ColdFusion image matching the vulnerable versions—e.g., adobe/coldfusion:10u22, adobe/coldfusion:11u11, and adobe/coldfusion:2016u3—by updating the build section to image: and adding the appropriate container_name or service name to differentiate them. Keep the nginx service unchanged but point its proxy_pass to the correct ColdFusion host and port (for example http://coldfusion10:8080, http://coldfusion11:8080, etc.). Ensure each ColdFusion container exposes port 8080 and that the compose file lists all four services (three ColdFusion instances plus nginx) so the required service set is satisfied. Finally, remove the custom Tomcat‑based Dockerfile and its placeholder files, since they are no longer needed.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Nginx Dockerfile tries to copy `default.conf` from a location that isn’t in the build context – the compose file sets the build directory to `./nginx`, but the file lives one level deeper ( `./nginx/default.conf` relative to the compose file). Move `default.conf` into the same folder as the Dockerfile (or change the Dockerfile line to `COPY ./default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`) so the copy succeeds. While you’re there, expose the ColdFusion containers on a real port (e.g., add `ports: - "8080"` to each CF service) or change the Nginx proxy to use the internal service name and port (e.g., `proxy_pass http://coldfusion10:8080;`). After fixing the copy path and ensuring the CF services are reachable, the compose stack should build and start correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The images built for coldfusion10, coldfusion11, and coldfusion2016 are based on 'nginx:alpine', not on any Adobe ColdFusion image. Consequently, their version information does not contain the required ColdFusion versions (10u22, 11u11, 2016u3). Since the services defined in docker‑compose.yml use these placeholder images instead of the expected 'adobe/coldfusion' images, the required services list ['adobe/coldfusion', 'adobe/coldfusion', 'adobe/coldfusion', 'nginx'] is not satisfied.
