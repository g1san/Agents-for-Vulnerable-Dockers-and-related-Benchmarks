    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20113066 is a critical Java deserialization vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the Apache BlazeDS library that is bundled with ColdFusion and is used for processing AMF (Action Message Format) messages. When ColdFusion receives a crafted AMF payload, the vulnerable BlazeDS code deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, allowing an attacker to instantiate arbitrary Java objects. This results in remote code execution, giving the attacker full control of the affected host. The vulnerability affects ColdFusion 10 Update 22 and earlier, ColdFusion 11 Update 11 and earlier, and ColdFusion 2016 Update 3 and earlier. No additional services are required to exploit the flaw; an attacker only needs network access to the ColdFusion endpoint that processes BlazeDS messages (e.g., /messagebroker/amf).",
