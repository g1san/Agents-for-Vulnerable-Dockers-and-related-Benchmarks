CVE description: CVE‑2020‑17518 is a directory‑traversal and arbitrary file‑upload vulnerability in the Apache Flink REST API. The vulnerable component is the FileUploadHandler used by the POST /jars/upload endpoint. The handler builds the destination path with `currentUploadDir.resolve(fileUpload.getFilename())` without sanitising the filename supplied by the client. By supplying a filename that contains traversal sequences such as "../../../", an attacker can cause Flink to write the uploaded file to any writable location on the host filesystem. This enables an attacker to place malicious JARs, scripts, or configuration files that can later be executed, leading to full host compromise. The flaw exists in all Flink releases from 1.5.1 (when the handler was introduced) through 1.11.2. The issue was fixed in Flink 1.11.3, where the filename is stripped of any path information before resolution. Exploitation consists of sending a crafted multipart‑POST request with a malicious `filename` value, which results in the file being written (e.g., to /tmp/poc.txt) even if the HTTP response indicates an error.
Attack Type: arbitrary file write on the server filesystem
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/flink][['1.5.1', '1.5.2', '1.6.0', '1.6.1', '1.6.2', '1.6.3', '1.6.4', '1.7.0', '1.7.1', '1.7.2', '1.8.0', '1.8.1', '1.8.2', '1.9.0', '1.9.1', '1.9.2', '1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.11.0', '1.11.1', '1.11.2']] Apache Flink container provides the vulnerable REST API (FileUploadHandler) needed to demonstrate CVE‑2020‑17518. Each listed version is vulnerable because it predates the fix introduced in 1.11.3.
- [SOFT-WEB][docker/compose][['2.20.2']] Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the Flink container and expose its REST port for testing the vulnerable upload endpoint.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Flask container is probably crashing because it tries to open the MySQL connection before the MySQL service is ready; adding a small start‑up wait (for example using `wait-for-it.sh` or a simple loop that retries `get_db_connection()` until it succeeds) will let the database finish initializing before the app starts. You can also improve the compose file by adding a healthcheck to the `vulnerable_db` service and changing `depends_on` to use `condition: service_healthy` so Docker will only start the Flask service when MySQL reports healthy. Removing the unnecessary `privileged: true` flag (the app only needs the socket mount) will also stop the container from being denied permissions on some hosts. After inserting a retry‑on‑failure loop in `app.py` or using a wrapper script in the Dockerfile to invoke the wait script before launching the Flask app, the containers should start and stay up.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup does not include the Apache Flink service at any version, so it cannot be using a vulnerable Flink version listed in the HARD versions list. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. Additionally, while the composition uses Docker Compose (docker/compose), the required Apache Flink service is absent, so the 'services_ok' milestone, which expects both apache/flink and docker/compose, is also not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup does not include the Apache Flink service at any version, so it cannot be using a vulnerable Flink version listed in the HARD versions list. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. Additionally, while the composition uses Docker Compose (docker/compose), the required Apache Flink service is absent, so the 'services_ok' milestone, which expects both apache/flink and docker/compose, is also not satisfied.
	- FIX: Add an Apache Flink service to the Compose file using a vulnerable Flink image (for example apache/flink:1.10.2) and expose its REST port, then make the existing vulnerable_app depend on that service instead of the MySQL container. Update the depends_on section so the Flask container starts after the Flink container is healthy, and include a healthcheck for Flink (e.g., curl http://localhost:8081). This introduces the required apache/flink service at a version listed in the HARD list, satisfying the code_hard_version and services_ok milestones while preserving the existing MySQL service.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the flink service’s health‑check runs curl, but the official apache/flink image does not include the curl binary, so the health‑check command fails and Docker aborts the compose run. To fix the problem you can either replace the health‑check with a command that exists in the base image (for example using wget or simply checking that the HTTP endpoint returns a 200 with nc) or extend the Flink image to install curl. The smallest change is to edit docker‑compose.yml so the flink service health‑check reads something like ["CMD", "wget", "-qO-", "http://localhost:8081"] or to remove the health‑check entirely; after that the vulnerable_app image builds without interruption.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the `flink` service is still referenced with `condition: service_healthy` in the `depends_on` section, but the image does not define a health‑check (the comment says it was removed). Docker Compose therefore aborts the startup of `vulnerable_app` with an “service … has no healthcheck” error. The fix is simply to make the dependency condition match what the service actually provides – either add a lightweight health‑check to the Flink container (for example a short curl or wget against `http://localhost:8081/metrics` with a retry) or drop the `condition: service_healthy` clause and let Docker Compose use the default “service started” ordering. Once the health‑check mismatch is removed, the images build and the stack will come up normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Flink container is fine, the issue is in the vulnerable_app service: the Docker‑socket endpoint returns an invalid HTTP status code (you used “5” instead of a valid three‑digit code) which makes Flask raise an exception and causes the container to exit, and the MySQL health‑check can fail if the init script path is not correctly resolved inside the volume. Change the /docker route to return a proper status such as 200 or 500, and correct the health‑check command to use the fully‑qualified MySQL client (e.g., ["CMD","mysqladmin","-h","localhost","-u","root","-p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}","ping"] ) so the db container is marked healthy; after these edits the compose stack should start normally.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The simplest way to get the stack running is to give the Flink service a health‑check so that Docker can wait for it to become ready before starting the vulnerable_app, and then change the depends_on clause to use that health status; you can add a lightweight curl‑based check (installing curl in the image or using the official flink‑docker‑base that already contains it) and set condition: service_healthy for the flink dependency. Additionally, the MySQL health‑check line needs quoting around the variable expansion – change -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} to -p"${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}" so the container can parse the command correctly. With those two tweaks the containers will start in the proper order and the vulnerable_app will be able to connect to the database, eliminating the startup failure.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the MySQL health‑check command is malformed – the password argument is quoted inside the JSON‑array syntax, which makes Docker‑Compose treat the whole string as a single literal and the `mysqladmin` call can’t parse it. Change the health‑check to pass the password without embedded quotes (or move the whole command into a shell string). In the compose file replace the line  

```yaml
test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "-h", "localhost", "-u", "root", "-p\"${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}\"", "ping"]
```  

with  

```yaml
test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "-h", "localhost", "-u", "root", "-p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}", "ping"]
```  

or, if you prefer a shell form,  

```yaml
test: curl -f http://localhost:3306 || exit 1
```  

After correcting the health‑check, the `vulnerable_app` image builds without error because the rest of the Dockerfile (copying `requirements.txt`, installing the Python packages, and copying the app code) is already valid. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the Python‑based app needs native build tools for the MySQL connector but the slim base image doesn’t provide them, so the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step aborts. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to install the required system packages before running `pip install` – for example add a line that runs `apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc libmariadb-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` right after setting the work directory. After the compiler and the MariaDB/MySQL client headers are available the `pip install` step will succeed and the image will build correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the apk / apt commands in the Dockerfile are trying to install packages that either don’t exist in the python:3.9‑slim repository or need additional dependencies, and the flink service health‑check is using wget which isn’t present in the official Flink image. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so it installs the required build tools and the MySQL client libraries that are actually available (for example, add default-libmysqlclient-dev and python3-dev or replace libmariadb-dev with default-libmysqlclient-dev), and clean up the apt cache after installation. Then update the docker‑compose.yml health‑check for the flink service to use curl instead of wget (e.g., test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8081"] ) or install wget in the image if you prefer to keep the original command. After these two changes the images should build and start without errors.
