{
    "desc": "CVE-2015-3337 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Elasticsearch HTTP API when a site\u2011plugin (such as the head, marvel, bigdesk, or similar plugins) is installed. The plugin handler builds a file path from the request URI and reads the file without properly normalising the path, allowing an attacker to include \"../\" sequences to escape the plugin directory. By sending a crafted request to `/_plugin/<plugin>/../../../../../..../<target\u2011file>` an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause Elasticsearch to read any file that the Elasticsearch process can access on the host filesystem (for example `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, configuration files, private keys, etc.) and return its contents in the HTTP response. The flaw exists in all Elasticsearch releases prior to 1.4.5 and prior to 1.5.2. Versions up to and including 1.4.4 and 1.5.1 are vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in Elasticsearch 1.4.5, 1.5.2 and later, or by disabling site\u2011plugins entirely.",
