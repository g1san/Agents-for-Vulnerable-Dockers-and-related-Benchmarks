CVE description: CVE‑2020‑9402 is a SQL injection vulnerability in Django's geographic information system (GIS) aggregation and function handling when the application is configured to use an Oracle database backend. The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a malicious value to the `tolerance` argument (or to field name parameters in certain aggregation calls). Django concatenates this value directly into raw SQL without proper sanitisation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary Oracle SQL statements. Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure, modification, or deletion of data stored in the Oracle database and may allow further compromise of the host system. The issue affects Django versions prior to the security releases that introduced proper escaping of the `tolerance` parameter.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][django][['1.11.0', '1.11.1', '1.11.2', '1.11.3', '1.11.4', '1.11.5', '1.11.6', '1.11.7', '1.11.8', '1.11.9', '1.11.10', '1.11.11', '1.11.12', '1.11.13', '1.11.14', '1.11.15', '1.11.16', '1.11.17', '1.11.18', '1.11.19', '1.11.20', '1.11.21', '1.11.22', '1.11.23', '1.11.24', '1.11.25', '1.11.26', '1.11.27', '1.11.28', '2.2.0', '2.2.1', '2.2.2', '2.2.3', '2.2.4', '2.2.5', '2.2.6', '2.2.7', '2.2.8', '2.2.9', '2.2.10', '3.0.0', '3.0.1', '3.0.2', '3.0.3']] Django framework provides the GIS aggregation functions where the vulnerable `tolerance` parameter is processed. Using any of the listed vulnerable versions with an Oracle backend makes the container susceptible to the SQL injection.
- [HARD][oracle/database][['19.3.0', '19.5.0', '18.4.0', '12.2.0.1', '12.1.0.2']] Oracle database serves as the backend for the Django application. The vulnerability is exploitable only when Django communicates with an Oracle database, as the injected payload is executed on this server.
- [SOFT-WEB][python][['3.8-slim']] Provides the runtime environment required by the Django application to run inside the container.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is probably failing because Flask 0.12 isn’t compatible with the Python 3.8 runtime you’re using, so the application crashes at import time; change the Dockerfile to install a version of Flask that supports Python 3.8 (for example, replace `pip install Flask==0.12 pymysql` with `pip install Flask==2.2.5 pymysql`) and then rebuild the image, which will allow the Flask app to start correctly and let the rest of the compose stack come up.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails while installing `cx_Oracle` because the Oracle client libraries it needs are not present in the slim‑Python base; the build therefore aborts during the `pip install` step. To fix it, extend the Dockerfile to (1) install the development packages required to compile the Python extension (e.g., `python3-dev gcc libaio-dev`) and (‑ preferably ‑) download and unpack the Oracle Instant Client Basic and SDK zip files (or the corresponding Debian packages), set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `LIBRARY_PATH`) to point at the client libraries, and then run `pip install cx_Oracle`. After these additions the `pip install Django==2.2.24 cx_Oracle` line succeeds and the image builds without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to download the Oracle Instant Client ZIP files directly from Oracle’s public site with a plain wget, but those files are behind a license‑acceptance page and the request is rejected (HTTP 403), so the unzip step never finds any archives and the later `ldconfig` step aborts. To fix the image you need to obtain the client libraries from a source that does not require an interactive license click – for example, copy the already‑downloaded ZIPs into the build context (or mount them as a build‑time volume) and replace the `wget` lines with a simple `COPY` of the archives, or use the Oracle‑provided Debian/Ubuntu packages (`oracle-instantclient19.8-basic`, `oracle-instantclient19.8-sdk`) that can be installed with `apt`. After the archives are available, keep the unzip and `ldconfig` steps unchanged, and make sure the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` points to the actual directory created by the unzip (e.g. `/opt/oracle/instantclient/instantclient_19_8`). With the client libraries correctly placed, the rest of the Dockerfile builds without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to copy the Instant Client zip files into `/opt/oracle/instantclient/` before that directory exists and then unpacks archives that either aren’t there or don’t contain the expected folder name, causing the `unzip` and `ldconfig` steps to error out. To fix it, first create the target directory, then copy the zip files into the build context (e.g., keep them alongside the Dockerfile) and copy them into the container‑side directory that already exists, and finally adjust the unzip command to point at the exact archive names and the extracted folder name (e.g., `instantclient_19_8`). After extracting, set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the path of the extracted client (the folder created by unzip) and run `ldconfig`. In short, ensure the directory hierarchy exists before copying, verify the zip filenames match the `COPY` and `unzip` commands, and use the correct client sub‑directory when configuring the environment variables. Once those steps are corrected the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the web image tries to install cx_Oracle without having the Oracle Instant Client libraries available in the container, and the Dockerfile never extracts the placeholder zip files it ships. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so that it installs the Instant Client libraries before running pip install cx_Oracle. One simple way is to add an `unzip` step (and the `unzip` package) that extracts the two placeholder zip files into `/opt/oracle/instantclient`, set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to that directory, and then install cx_Oracle. For example, after installing `gcc`, `libaio1`, and `libaio-dev`, add `apt-get install -y unzip && unzip instantclient-basic-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip -d /opt/oracle && unzip instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip -d /opt/oracle && rm -f instantclient-*.zip && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_19_8:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before the `pip install` line. This ensures the required client libraries are present, allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to unzip the placeholder files `instantclient-basic-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip` and `instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip`, which are not real zip archives, so the `unzip` command aborts and stops the image creation. Replace those placeholder files with the actual Oracle Instant Client ZIPs (or download them at build time with `wget` or `curl`), then adjust the Dockerfile to extract the real archives (for example, add a `RUN wget … && unzip …`). Once the genuine client files are available, the `unzip` step succeeds, the `cx_Oracle` module can compile against the Instant Client libraries, and the image will build without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to download the Oracle Instant Client zip files at build time, but Oracle requires a licence‑acceptance cookie and the URLs are no longer publicly reachable, so the `wget` commands return a 403 and the subsequent `unzip` step aborts. To fix it, replace the download step with a reliable source for the client libraries – either pull the pre‑built Instant Client packages from the Oracle‑provided APT repository or copy the zipped client files into the build context and untar them locally. A minimal change is to comment out the two `wget` lines and instead install the client via APT:

```dockerfile
# add Oracle Instant Client APT repo
RUN echo "deb http://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/19.8/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oracle-instantclient.list && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends oracle-instantclient19.8-basic oracle-instantclient19.8-sdk && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

If you prefer to keep the zip‑based approach, place the two zip files (the actual Instant Client Basic and SDK archives) in `web/` and change the Dockerfile to unzip those local copies instead of downloading them:

```dockerfile
COPY instantclient-basic-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip /opt/oracle/
COPY instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip /opt/oracle/
RUN cd /opt/oracle && \
    unzip instantclient-basic-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip && \
    unzip instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-19.8.0.0.0dbru.zip && \
    rm -f instantclient-*.zip
```

After the client libraries are successfully installed, keep the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` line and the `pip install` line unchanged. With the client present, the image builds without error and the Django app can connect to the Oracle XE container.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to run `lsb_release -cs` to add the Instant Client APT source, but the `lsb-release` package isn’t installed in the `python:3.8‑slim` image, so the command returns an empty string and the subsequent `apt-get update` cannot locate the repository. To fix it, install `lsb-release` (or simply hard‑code the Debian codename, e.g. “buster”) before adding the Oracle source line, and then add the repository and the client packages as before. In practice the fix is a one‑line change: add `lsb-release` to the first `apt-get install` command (or replace `$(lsb_release -cs)` with `buster`), which resolves the missing‑codename error and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Debian‑based python:3.8‑slim image does not support the Oracle Instant Client APT repository – the repository URL is for Oracle Linux and the apt‑key step is rejected, so the “oracle‑instantclient19.8‑basic” and “‑sdk” packages can’t be installed. To fix it, replace the slim‑Debian base with an Oracle Linux (or Ubuntu) image that includes the Oracle Instant Client repository, or skip the apt‑based installation entirely and download the Instant Client zip files directly from Oracle, unzip them into /usr/lib/oracle/19.8/client64/lib, and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly; then run pip install Django==2.2.24 cx_Oracle==8.3.0 as before. Adjust the Dockerfile accordingly (remove the failing apt‑key/apt‑repo lines, add a curl or wget of the zip, unzip, and clean up) so the image can be built and the Django app can connect to the Oracle XE container.   (All other files can stay unchanged.)


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
