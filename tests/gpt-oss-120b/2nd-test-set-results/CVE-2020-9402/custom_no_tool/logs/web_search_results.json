    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u20119402 is a SQL injection vulnerability in Django's geographic information system (GIS) aggregation and function handling when the application is configured to use an Oracle database backend. The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a malicious value to the `tolerance` argument (or to field name parameters in certain aggregation calls). Django concatenates this value directly into raw SQL without proper sanitisation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary Oracle SQL statements. Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure, modification, or deletion of data stored in the Oracle database and may allow further compromise of the host system. The issue affects Django versions prior to the security releases that introduced proper escaping of the `tolerance` parameter.",
