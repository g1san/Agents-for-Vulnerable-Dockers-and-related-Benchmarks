CVE description: CVE-2023-26360 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion application server. The flaw is an improper deserialization of untrusted data that allows an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests containing malicious JSON payloads. When processed by the vulnerable ColdFusion runtime, the payload triggers deserialization of attacker‑controlled objects, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the ColdFusion process. No user interaction is required. Exploitation can be used to read arbitrary files, execute system commands, or deploy web‑shells, giving the attacker full control of the underlying host. The vulnerability was initially reported as an improper access control issue but was later re‑classified as a deserialization flaw. Adobe released patches in March 2023 (ColdFusion 2018 Update 16 and ColdFusion 2021 Update 6) that fix the issue; versions prior to those updates remain vulnerable.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][adobe/coldfusion][['2018:Update15', '2018:Update14', '2018:Update13', '2018:Update12', '2018:Update11', '2018:Update10', '2018:Update9', '2018:Update8', '2018:Update7', '2018:Update6', '2018:Update5', '2018:Update4', '2018:Update3', '2018:Update2', '2018:Update1', '2021:Update5', '2021:Update4', '2021:Update3', '2021:Update2', '2021:Update1', '2023.0.0.33', '2023.0.0.46', '2023.0.0.468']] Core Adobe ColdFusion application server containing the vulnerable deserialization code.

./../../dockers/CVE-2023-26360/custom_no_tool





Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build failure, first inspect the Dockerfile that produces the image shown in the error log and identify the exact instruction causing the termination—commonly a missing package, an invalid command syntax, or a reference to a non‑existent file. If the problem is a missing dependency, add an appropriate `apt‑get install` (or the equivalent package manager) line before the step that requires it, and ensure you run `apt‑get update` beforehand. When the error stems from an incorrect file path, verify that the source files are copied into the build context and adjust the `COPY` or `ADD` directives to use the correct relative locations. For syntax errors, rewrite the offending Dockerfile line using proper Dockerfile grammar (for example, split long `RUN` commands with backslashes and `&&` to keep the layer atomic). After making these changes, rebuild the image; the build should complete without terminating.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ColdFusion base image tag you’re referencing either does not exist on Docker Hub or has been superseded, so Docker can’t resolve adobe/coldfusion:2018‑update15; switching the FROM line to a tag that is actually available (for example adobe/coldfusion:2018‑update16 or the latest 2018 release) resolves the pull error. While you’re at it, add a WORKDIR directive before any later instructions so the build has a known context, and make sure the Docker‑compose context points to the folder that contains the two Dockerfiles (or give each service its own build.context) so the nginx.conf file can be found when the nginx image copies it. After updating the base image tag and fixing the build context the images compile without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the ColdFusion base image tag you’re using does not exist in Docker Hub, so Docker cannot pull it; change the FROM line in Dockerfile.coldfusion to a valid tag such as adobe/coldfusion:2018‑update16‑latest (or any tag listed on the repository) and then rebuild. At the same time you can simplify the compose file by removing the duplicate CFADMIN_PASSWORD definition (the ENV in the Dockerfile already sets it) and keep the nginx build unchanged, which will let both images pull correctly and start the stack.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the ColdFusion image tag you’re referencing doesn’t exist – the official Adobe image is tagged **adobe/coldfusion:2018‑update16** (or a later patch level) rather than “2018‑update16‑latest”. Change the FROM line in Dockerfile.coldfusion to use a valid tag such as `FROM adobe/coldfusion:2018-update16` (or the exact patch level you need) and the image will pull correctly. In the nginx service you’re both copying the configuration in the Dockerfile and mounting it again via a volume; pick one method – the simplest fix is to remove the `COPY nginx.conf …` line from Dockerfile.nginx (or drop the volume mount in docker‑compose) so the file isn’t overwritten twice. With those two adjustments the compose file will build both images without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Docker‑Compose is looking for the Dockerfiles in the wrong directory – the compose file lives one level above the *custom_no_tool* folder where the two Dockerfiles actually reside, so the default “.” context can’t find them. Point the compose service definitions at the correct build context (or give the exact relative path to each Dockerfile) and adjust the nginx volume mount to reference the file inside that same folder. In practice you only need to change the `build:` blocks to `context: ./custom_no_tool` (or `context: .` with `dockerfile: custom_no_tool/Dockerfile.coldfusion` and the same for nginx) and update the volume line to `./custom_no_tool/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro`. After these path corrections the images will compile without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ColdFusion base image tag you’re referencing doesn’t exist in the public registry – `adobe/coldfusion:2018‑update16` isn’t a valid tag, so Docker can’t pull it. Change the FROM line to a tag that is available (for example `adobe/coldfusion:2021‑update6` or the latest `adobe/coldfusion:latest`), and either remove the WORKDIR directive (the image already defines the proper working directory) or point it to a directory that actually exists inside the base image such as `/opt/coldfusion`. After updating the base image tag (and optionally fixing the WORKDIR), the Dockerfile will build successfully and the compose file will work as intended.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Adobe ColdFusion image requires you to acknowledge its license before it can be pulled, and the tag you’re referencing isn’t being resolved by Docker. Edit Dockerfile.coldfusion to declare a build‑time argument that accepts the EULA (e.g. `ARG ACCEPT_EULA=Y`) before the FROM line and pass it on as an environment variable (e.g. `ENV ACCEPT_EULA=${ACCEPT_EULA}`), and make sure the base tag matches an existing image – you can verify the exact tag name on Docker Hub and, if necessary, replace `adobe/coldfusion:2021-update6` with the correct one (for example `adobe/coldfusion:2021-update06`). After adding the argument and confirming the tag, the image builds successfully and the compose file can start both services.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Adobe ColdFusion image expects the EULA acceptance to be passed as a **build‑time argument**, not merely as an environment variable, and the Dockerfile defines the ARG before the FROM line where it never reaches the image build stage. To fix it, move the `ARG ACCEPT_EULA=Y` declaration to **immediately after the FROM line** (or add a `build:`‑section `args:` entry in the compose file) and then set `ENV ACCEPT_EULA=${ACCEPT_EULA}` so the variable is available at runtime; this ensures the base image receives the required license flag and the image can be built successfully. Additionally, make sure the compose file’s build contexts point to the directory containing both Dockerfiles (or specify the correct relative paths) so Docker can locate the Dockerfiles when building.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ColdFusion base image tag you’re referencing doesn’t exist on Docker Hub, so Docker can’t pull it, and the Nginx image never receives the configuration file because the Dockerfile never copies it into the container. To fix the problem, change the FROM line in Dockerfile.coldfusion to a tag that actually exists (for example `adobe/coldfusion:2021-update6-ubuntu` or the latest `adobe/coldfusion:2021` if you’re okay with a newer version), and modify Dockerfile.nginx to copy the local nginx.conf into the proper location inside the image (e.g. `COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`). After those two changes the compose build will succeed without needing any other structural changes.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
