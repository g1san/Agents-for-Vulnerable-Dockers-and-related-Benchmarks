    "desc": "CVE-2023-26360 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion application server. The flaw is an improper deserialization of untrusted data that allows an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests containing malicious JSON payloads. When processed by the vulnerable ColdFusion runtime, the payload triggers deserialization of attacker\u2011controlled objects, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the ColdFusion process. No user interaction is required. Exploitation can be used to read arbitrary files, execute system commands, or deploy web\u2011shells, giving the attacker full control of the underlying host. The vulnerability was initially reported as an improper access control issue but was later re\u2011classified as a deserialization flaw. Adobe released patches in March\u202f2023 (ColdFusion 2018 Update\u202f16 and ColdFusion 2021 Update\u202f6) that fix the issue; versions prior to those updates remain vulnerable.",
