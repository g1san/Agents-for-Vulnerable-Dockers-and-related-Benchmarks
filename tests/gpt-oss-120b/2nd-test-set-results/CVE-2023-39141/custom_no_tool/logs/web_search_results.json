    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201139141 is a critical path\u2011traversal vulnerability found in the `webui-aria2` project, which provides a Node.js based web user interface for the Aria2 download manager. The vulnerable component is the `node-server.js` file, which constructs a file\u2011system path by directly concatenating the request URL segment (or a query parameter) with a base directory without performing any sanitisation or canonicalisation. As a result, an attacker can supply sequences such as \"../\" in the request path, causing the server to resolve to locations outside the intended web\u2011root. By sending a crafted HTTP request, for example `curl --path-as-is http://<host>:8888/../../../etc/passwd`, the attacker can retrieve the contents of arbitrary files that are readable by the `www` user. This flaw affects every released version of `webui-aria2` up to the most recent commit `109903f0e2774cf948698cd95a01f77f33d7dd2c`; no patched version has been published. The impact is a full confidentiality breach, enabling disclosure of system configuration files, private keys, credentials, and any other readable data on the host. Because the service typically runs without authentication on a network\u2011exposed port, exploitation requires only network access to the WebUI endpoint, making the vulnerability easy to exploit remotely.",
