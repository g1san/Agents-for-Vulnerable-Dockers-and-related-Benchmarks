----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2019‑3396 is a critical vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center that resides in the Widget Connector macro (com.atlassian.confluence.extra.widgetconnector). The macro’s render method accepts a `_template` parameter that specifies a Velocity template to load. The code fails to restrict the value of `_template`, allowing an attacker to supply an arbitrary template path such as `file:///etc/passwd` or a remote URL (e.g., `ftp://attacker.com/malicious.vm`). When the template is processed by Confluence’s Velocity engine, the attacker can execute arbitrary Java code, invoke reflection, and ultimately run operating‑system commands via `java.lang.Runtime.exec`. This server‑side template injection gives the attacker full remote code execution without any authentication. The impact includes reading confidential files, installing back‑doors, lateral movement, and complete takeover of the Confluence host. The vulnerability affects all Confluence Server/Data Center releases prior to the March 20 2019 security update, specifically versions before 6.6.12, 6.12.3, 6.13.3, 6.14.2 and 6.15.1. No additional services are required beyond the vulnerable Confluence application itself; the exploit can be performed simply by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the REST endpoint `/rest/tinymce/1/macro/preview` with a malicious JSON payload.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the Confluence container exits immediately – the server image requires a valid license key and will not start without one, so the service never becomes healthy and Docker reports an error. Add the Atlassian license to the Confluence service’s environment (for example `ATL_LICENSE_KEY: <your‑base64‑encoded‑license>`), and optionally set `ATL_JDBC_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver` to make the JDBC driver explicit. Also make sure the PostgreSQL image gets a password for the default “postgres” super‑user (the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` you set already satisfies that) and that the `init.sql` file is correctly mounted; with the license variable in place the stack will start normally.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Confluence service fails to start in this compose file is that the PostgreSQL initialization script is not being mounted because the relative path `./postgres/init.sql` does not point to the actual file location; adjust the volume definition to reference the correct location (for example `- ./custom_no_tool/postgres/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` or use an absolute path). Next, replace the placeholder `"<base64-encoded-license-key>"` with a real base‑64‑encoded Confluence license or remove the variable entirely if you are testing an unlicensed instance, because an empty or malformed license causes the Confluence container to exit immediately. Finally, add a simple health‑check or `restart: unless‑stopped` for the database and ensure the `depends_on` ordering is respected – you can insert a `command: ["sh","-c","/wait-for-it.sh db:5432 -- /entrypoint.sh"]` wrapper so Confluence only starts after PostgreSQL is ready. Making these three changes to the compose file should bring both containers up correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Confluence service stays in a crashed state is that the compose file asks the container to run `/wait-for-it.sh` but never makes that script available inside the image; as a result the entrypoint cannot be found and the container exits immediately. Add a bind‑mount (or a Docker‑file‑based copy) that puts the local wait‑for‑it.sh into the container’s filesystem, for example by extending the Confluence image with a tiny Dockerfile that copies the script to `/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh` and makes it executable, then change the command line to reference that path. Alternatively you can mount the script directly in docker‑compose.yml under the Confluence service (e.g. `- ./wait-for-it.sh:/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh:ro`) and update the command to `["sh","-c","/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh db:5432 -- /entrypoint.sh"]`. After adding the script the Confluence container will be able to wait for the database to become healthy and start correctly. If you also want to eliminate the underlying vulnerability, replace the `atlassian/confluence-server:6.14.1` image with a patched version (≥ 6.14.2) or apply the official security update.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Confluence service never starts is that the wait‑for‑it script tries to use `nc`, but the official atlassian/confluence‑server image does not include netcat, so the script exits and the container stops. Fix it by building a small wrapper image that adds netcat (e.g., `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y netcat-openbsd`) and copies the existing `wait‑for‑it.sh` into it, then point the compose file’s confluence service to that new image. At the same time, remove the empty ATL_LICENSE_KEY environment variable or supply a valid trial key, because an empty string forces the application to abort during startup. After these two changes the health check will succeed, the database will be ready, and the Confluence container will come up normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Container logs show repeated "Waiting for db:5432..." messages, indicating the wait‑for‑it script is still waiting for the database service and the container has not progressed to its normal operation. This suggests the container is not running correctly.
	- ERROR: Container logs show repeated "Waiting for db:5432..." messages, indicating the wait‑for‑it script is still waiting for the database service and the container has not progressed to its normal operation. This suggests the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The wait‑for‑it script is being called with a single argument “db:5432”, but the nc command inside the script expects the host and the port as separate parameters, so the test never succeeds and the Confluence container never starts. Change the compose file so the script receives the host and the port as two arguments (for example `wait-for-it.sh db 5432`) and adjust the script to accept this form (or simply replace the loop with `nc -z "$host" "$port"` after splitting the argument). After passing the correct host‑port pair the health‑check will succeed, the wait‑for‑it loop will exit, and the Confluence container will proceed to run `/entrypoint.sh` as intended.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common cause is that the command you set replaces the image’s original entrypoint, so the Confluence start‑up script never runs after the wait‑for‑it check finishes. Change the service definition to use the script as an entrypoint instead of a command and pass the original entrypoint as the final argument, for example: entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh","db","5432","--","/entrypoint.sh"] and remove the command line entirely. If the health‑check on the Postgres container fails, ensure the database environment variables are correct and that the POSTGRES_PASSWORD matches the one used by pg_isready in the healthcheck. After applying these two tweaks the Confluence container should start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Confluence container is probably exiting because the custom entrypoint can’t find or run the wait‑for‑it script, so the start‑up fails before the Atlassian server launches. First make sure the script is copied into the image at the exact path used in the compose file (the Dockerfile already copies it to /usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh) and verify that the file has Unix line endings and the executable flag set; you can add a debug line like `RUN ls -l /usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh && cat -v /usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh` to the Dockerfile to confirm. Next, adjust the service definition to call the script with the full path and the proper arguments, for example change the entrypoint line to `entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh","db","5432","--","/entrypoint.sh"]` so Docker uses the exact location. If the script still fails, replace the netcat check with a simpler loop that uses `bash -c "while !</dev/tcp/$host/$port> /dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done"` to avoid missing the nc binary. Finally, ensure the database volume is writable by the postgres user (the default Docker image sets correct permissions, but a mismatch can occur if the host directory already exists); you can delete any pre‑existing host‑side `db_data` directory or run `chmod -R 777 db_data` temporarily to see if that resolves the health‑check failure. After these changes rebuild the image (`docker compose build`) and bring the stack up again; Confluence should start once the database reports healthy.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Confluence service stays down is that the custom entrypoint overwrites the image’s original start‑up script, so after the wait‑for‑it loop finishes the container has nothing to launch. Fix it by keeping the wait‑for‑it wrapper but invoking the original Confluence entrypoint afterwards. Change the entrypoint line to call the script and then exec the image’s default command (normally /entrypoint.sh or /opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start‑confluence.sh). For example:

```
entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh","db","5432","--","/entrypoint.sh"]
```

If /entrypoint.sh expects additional arguments, pass them exactly as the upstream image does (often “-fg”). After updating the compose file, run docker‑compose up again; the wait‑for‑it script will pause until PostgreSQL is ready and then hand control to Confluence’s proper start‑up, allowing the container to run correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is probably failing because the custom entrypoint replaces Confluence’s original startup script, so the application never launches after the wait‑for‑it check finishes. Change the compose file to run the wait‑for‑it script as a `command` instead of overriding the image’s `entrypoint`, letting the image’s default entrypoint start Confluence. In docker‑compose.yml replace the `entrypoint:` line with `command: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh","db","5432","--","/entrypoint.sh"] (or point to the actual Confluence start script bundled in the image). After this adjustment the wait script will block only until PostgreSQL is ready and then hand control back to the original Confluence entrypoint, allowing the container to come up correctly.
