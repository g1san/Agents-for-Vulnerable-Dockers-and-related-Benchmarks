    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20111000353 is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Jenkins. The flaw resides in the older remoting\u2011based Jenkins command\u2011line interface (CLI) which accepts a serialized Java SignedObject from an unauthenticated client. The server deserializes the object with a new ObjectInputStream, bypassing the deserialization blocklist and allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Jenkins controller. Exploitation requires only network access to the Jenkins CLI endpoint (typically port 50000) and no credentials. The vulnerability affects Jenkins core versions up to and including 2.56 and LTS versions up to and including 2.46.1. The issue was mitigated by adding SignedObject to the blocklist, disabling the old remoting\u2011based CLI by default, and releasing patched versions (Jenkins\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.57, LTS\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.46.2).",
