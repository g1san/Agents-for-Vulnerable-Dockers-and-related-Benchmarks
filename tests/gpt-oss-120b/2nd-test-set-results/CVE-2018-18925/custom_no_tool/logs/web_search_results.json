    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201118925 is a vulnerability in Gogs, a self\u2011hosted Git service built on the Macaron framework. The flaw resides in the file\u2011based session provider used by Macaron. Gogs does not properly validate the session identifier contained in the `i_like_gogits` cookie. An attacker can craft a session ID that includes directory\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\") so that the server resolves the session file path directly. This allows the attacker to place a malicious Gob\u2011encoded session file on the server (for example by uploading it as an attachment) and then force Gogs to load that file as a session. By setting the fields of the deserialized session (uid, uname, etc.) the attacker can impersonate any user, including the administrator. Once an administrator session is obtained, the attacker can create or modify Git hook scripts (such as pre\u2011receive or post\u2011receive hooks) in any repository, causing the server to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands when the hook is triggered. The overall impact is full remote command execution on the host running Gogs, combined with authentication bypass that grants administrative privileges.",
