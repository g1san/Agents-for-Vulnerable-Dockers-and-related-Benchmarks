CVE description: CVE‑2018‑18925 is a vulnerability in Gogs, a self‑hosted Git service built on the Macaron framework. The flaw resides in the file‑based session provider used by Macaron. Gogs does not properly validate the session identifier contained in the `i_like_gogits` cookie. An attacker can craft a session ID that includes directory‑traversal sequences (e.g., "../") so that the server resolves the session file path directly. This allows the attacker to place a malicious Gob‑encoded session file on the server (for example by uploading it as an attachment) and then force Gogs to load that file as a session. By setting the fields of the deserialized session (uid, uname, etc.) the attacker can impersonate any user, including the administrator. Once an administrator session is obtained, the attacker can create or modify Git hook scripts (such as pre‑receive or post‑receive hooks) in any repository, causing the server to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands when the hook is triggered. The overall impact is full remote command execution on the host running Gogs, combined with authentication bypass that grants administrative privileges.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file and Docker images use nginx:1.14, php:5.6-apache, and mysql:5.7. None of these correspond to the gogs/gogs service, which is the only service listed in the hard‑version list. Therefore no vulnerable gogs version is present, causing code_hard_version to be false. Additionally, the required service gogs/gogs is absent from the configuration, so services_ok is also false.
	- ERROR: The compose file and Docker images use nginx:1.14, php:5.6-apache, and mysql:5.7. None of these correspond to the gogs/gogs service, which is the only service listed in the hard‑version list. Therefore no vulnerable gogs version is present, causing code_hard_version to be false. Additionally, the required service gogs/gogs is absent from the configuration, so services_ok is also false.
	- FIX: Add a gogs service to the compose file using an image that matches one of the listed vulnerable versions (for example gogs/gogs:0.11.39), mount the required configuration and data directories, and remove the unrelated web/app/db services or replace them with the official Gogs containers. Adjust the Nginx reverse‑proxy to forward traffic to the Gogs service instead of the custom PHP app, and ensure the session storage path points to a location that the Gogs container can write to, thereby aligning the stack with the hard‑version list and satisfying the services_ok check.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to mount a configuration file that lives in a sibling directory, but the relative path `./web/default.conf` is resolved from the directory where Docker Compose is executed, not from the location of the `docker‑compose.yml` itself, so Docker can’t find the file and aborts the build. The quickest fix is to point the bind‑mount at the absolute location of the file (or use a `${PWD}`‑style substitution) and make sure the named volume is declared correctly. Change the nginx service’s volume line to something like  

```yaml
- ${PWD}/web/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
```  

and replace the top‑level volume stanza with an explicit empty definition (for clarity)  

```yaml
volumes:
  gogs_data: {}
```  

With those two changes Docker Compose will be able to locate the Nginx config and bring up both containers without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is missing a version header and the host‑side path for the nginx config is being interpolated with ${PWD}, which Docker Compose often can’t resolve when the file isn’t launched from its own directory. Add a version line (e.g. `version: "3.8"`), replace the `${PWD}/web/default.conf` bind‑mount with a plain relative path (`./web/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro`), and make sure the `web` folder and `default.conf` actually exist next to the compose file. Those two tweaks will stop the build‑time error and let the stack start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Docker can’t find the N‑ginx configuration file you mount into the container; make sure a “web” directory exists at the same level as the compose file and that it contains a file called default.conf with the contents you posted. If the path is correct, also verify that the file permissions allow the Docker daemon to read it (for example, chmod 644 ./web/default.conf). After creating the missing directory/file (or fixing the relative path), docker‑compose up will start both services without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the nginx service is trying to mount a configuration file that the compose file can’t locate – the path `./web/default.conf` is not relative to the compose file’s directory. Change the volume line to point at the actual location of the file (for example `./custom_no_tool/web/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro` or move the file into a `web` folder next to the compose file) so that Docker can copy it into the container during startup. Once the path is corrected and the file is present, the compose stack should bring up both Gogs and nginx without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the bind‑mount for the nginx configuration pointing at a non‑existent location (or a path that Docker can’t resolve from the compose file’s directory). To fix it, move the *default.conf* file into the same folder as the compose file (or adjust the path to the exact location where the file lives) and change the volume line to reference that correct relative path, for example:

```
volumes:
  - ./default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
```

If you keep the original folder structure, make sure the compose file is placed in `./../../dockers/CVE-2018-18925/custom_no_tool/web/` or update the mount to `./web/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro`. Removing the duplicate `container_name` entries (or giving them unique names) also prevents naming collisions that can abort the compose up process. After correcting the mount path (and optionally the container names), `docker‑compose up` will pull the images and start the services without errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The containers do not expose the services on their default host ports. Gogs maps its SSH service (22) to host port 2222 instead of the default 22, and its web UI (3000) is correctly mapped but the SSH port is not default. Nginx maps its HTTP port (80) to host port 8080, which also deviates from the default of 80. Because at least one service per container uses a non‑default host port, the 'network_setup' milestone is not met.
	- ERROR: The containers do not expose the services on their default host ports. Gogs maps its SSH service (22) to host port 2222 instead of the default 22, and its web UI (3000) is correctly mapped but the SSH port is not default. Nginx maps its HTTP port (80) to host port 8080, which also deviates from the default of 80. Because at least one service per container uses a non‑default host port, the 'network_setup' milestone is not met.
	- FIX: Update the compose file so each container publishes its service on the same host port it runs internally: change the Gogs SSH mapping from "2222:22" to "22:22", keep the web UI as "3000:3000", and modify the Nginx mapping from "8080:80" to "80:80". With these adjustments the services will be reachable on their default host ports, satisfying the network_setup milestone.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
