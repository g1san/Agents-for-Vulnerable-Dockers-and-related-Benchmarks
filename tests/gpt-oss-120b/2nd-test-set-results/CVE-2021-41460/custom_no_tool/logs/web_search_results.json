    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201141460 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in ECShop version 4.1.0. The flaw resides in the core ECShop application code where user\u2011supplied input is concatenated into SQL statements without proper sanitisation or parameterisation. An attacker can craft malicious values that are incorporated into database queries, allowing execution of arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information and payment details stored in the ECShop database, as well as possible modification or deletion of database records. The vulnerability is present in the application layer itself and does not require any additional modules or services to be exploited.",
