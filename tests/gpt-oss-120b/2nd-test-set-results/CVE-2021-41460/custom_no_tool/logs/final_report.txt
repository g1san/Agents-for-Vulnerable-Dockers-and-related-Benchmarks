CVE description: CVE‑2021‑41460 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in ECShop version 4.1.0. The flaw resides in the core ECShop application code where user‑supplied input is concatenated into SQL statements without proper sanitisation or parameterisation. An attacker can craft malicious values that are incorporated into database queries, allowing execution of arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information and payment details stored in the ECShop database, as well as possible modification or deletion of database records. The vulnerability is present in the application layer itself and does not require any additional modules or services to be exploited.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ecshop/ecshop][['4.1.0']] Core ECShop web application that contains the vulnerable SQL query handling. This service is essential for reproducing the CVE‑2021‑41460 vulnerability.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7.41']] Relational database used by ECShop to store its data. Required for the Docker environment to run ECShop but not directly related to the vulnerability.
- [SOFT-WEB][httpd][['2.4.46']] Apache HTTP Server that provides the web server front‑end for ECShop. Needed to serve the application in the Docker stack.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Container state is 'running' but the application fails to start properly: logs show a DB connection error (ECONNREFUSED to 172.18.0.2:3306). The app cannot reach its MySQL database, so the service is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: Container state is 'running' but the application fails to start properly: logs show a DB connection error (ECONNREFUSED to 172.18.0.2:3306). The app cannot reach its MySQL database, so the service is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The connection fails because the web container tries to open the MySQL socket as soon as it starts, while the database service is still initializing; the depends_on directive only orders container start‑up but does not wait for the DB to become reachable. To fix it, add a simple retry loop around db.connect that catches ECONNREFUSED and re‑attempts the connection after a short delay (e.g., 2 seconds) until it succeeds, and optionally use a health‑check on the db service together with depends_on condition service_healthy so Docker will delay launching the web container until MySQL reports “ready”. This ensures the web app only attempts the query after the database is fully up, eliminating the ECONNREFUSED error.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Container state shows it is running, but the logs contain repeated 'DB connection refused' errors, indicating the application cannot connect to its database and is not functioning correctly.
	- ERROR: Container state shows it is running, but the logs contain repeated 'DB connection refused' errors, indicating the application cannot connect to its database and is not functioning correctly.
	- FIX: The DB container never reports “healthy” because the health‑check is trying to ping MySQL without authenticating, so the web service keeps trying to connect before the database is ready and gets ECONNREFUSED each time. Fix it by changing the healthcheck in the compose file to include the root credentials (e.g. `["CMD","mysqladmin","ping","-h","localhost","-u","root","-p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"]`) so the db service reaches the *healthy* state, and keep the existing `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`. Once the healthcheck succeeds the web container’s retry loop will connect successfully and the app will run.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Although the container state shows it is running, the logs contain repeated 'DB connection refused' errors, indicating the application cannot connect to its database and is not functioning correctly.
	- ERROR: Although the container state shows it is running, the logs contain repeated 'DB connection refused' errors, indicating the application cannot connect to its database and is not functioning correctly.
	- FIX: The DB‑refused messages stem from the web container trying to open a MySQL connection before the database is fully ready; in Compose 3 the *condition* syntax is ignored, so the web service starts immediately. Fix it by making the Node app wait a bit longer before the first attempt (e.g., wrap the initial connectWithRetry call in a setTimeout of 5–10 seconds) and by switching to a connection pool (`mysql.createPool`) that automatically retries on “ECONNREFUSED” until a successful connection is obtained. With the delayed start and a resilient pool the app will eventually connect once the MySQL container finishes its initialization and the health‑check passes.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines two services: 'web' based on node:12-alpine and 'db' based on mysql:5.7. It does not include the required services 'ecshop/ecshop' or 'httpd', therefore the 'services_ok' milestone is not met. Additionally, the only service that could match the vulnerable version list is 'ecshop/ecshop' version 4.1.0, which is not present in the images used, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is also not met.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines two services: 'web' based on node:12-alpine and 'db' based on mysql:5.7. It does not include the required services 'ecshop/ecshop' or 'httpd', therefore the 'services_ok' milestone is not met. Additionally, the only service that could match the vulnerable version list is 'ecshop/ecshop' version 4.1.0, which is not present in the images used, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is also not met.
	- FIX: To satisfy the services_ok milestone you need to add the missing ECShop and Apache containers to the compose file, for example by defining an ecshop service that uses the official ecshop/ecshop:4.1.0 image and an httpd service based on httpd:2.4.46 that proxies requests to the Node app or serves the ECShop web files. Then update the web service to depend on both ecshop and httpd so the stack starts in the correct order. Finally, ensure the ECShop service runs the vulnerable 4.1.0 version (or the exact tag you need) so the code_hard_version milestone is met; this may require pulling the correct image tag or building a small Dockerfile that sets ECSHOP_VERSION=4.1.0 and installs the appropriate code. Once those services are present and correctly version‑ed, the composition will meet both milestones.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The container that’s crashing is the one that Docker can’t create because the `ecshop/ecshop:4.1.0` image simply isn’t available in any public registry, so the compose pull fails and the whole stack aborts. To get the stack running you have two quick options: either replace that reference with a real, reachable image (for example `ghcr.io/ecshop/ecshop:4.1.0` or whatever tag you’ve built locally) or add a small Dockerfile under `./ecshop` that builds the ECShop source and then change the service definition to `build: ./ecshop` instead of `image:`. While you’re editing the compose file, fix the health‑check command syntax so the password variable is expanded correctly – change `-p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` to `-p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}`. After swapping the missing image for a valid one (or building it locally) and correcting the health‑check line, the compose file will load all three services without error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the **httpd** Dockerfile is trying to copy a file that isn’t where the build context expects it to be – the `conf/httpd.conf` path is relative to the *build context* (`./httpd`), so the Dockerfile must reference the file inside that context. Changing the `COPY` line to use the correct relative location (for example `COPY ./conf/httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf`) fixes the copy error, and the image can be built successfully. Once the copy path is corrected, the compose stack starts without the previous termination.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the compose file references images that no longer exist in the public registries – the `ecshop/ecshop:4.1.0` image has been removed and the `node:12‑alpine` base has been deprecated, so Docker cannot pull them. To fix it, replace the ECShop service with a custom‑built image (or point it at a current tag that actually exists) and change the Node Dockerfile to use a supported LTS base such as `node:14-alpine` (or a newer 12‑alpine variant that still exists). After updating the `image:` line for ECShop (or adding a `build:` section that creates the ECShop container from a local Dockerfile) and editing the `FROM` line in `web/Dockerfile` to the newer Node tag, run `docker compose build` again; the images will pull successfully and the stack will start.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the ECShop stage can’t finish the “wget … ecshop.zip” line – the URL that points at the GitHub tag no longer returns a zip file (GitHub now redirects to a release page, and the plain “v4.1.0.zip” link is dead). Change the Dockerfile to fetch a known‑good archive (for example the official release archive `https://codeload.github.com/ecshop/ecshop/zip/refs/tags/v4.1.0`) and then unzip that file. After the download succeeds the rest of the steps (unzip, move the files, set permissions) run without error, so the whole compose stack starts normally.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the ECShop Dockerfile tries to download a zip file that no longer exists at the hard‑coded GitHub URL, so the `wget` command fails and the image can’t be created. Edit the Dockerfile in `custom_no_tool/ecshop` to point to a valid source – for example replace the current `wget -O ecshop.zip https://codeload.github.com/ecshop/ecshop/zip/refs/tags/v4.1.0` line with a command that clones the repository or uses a working archive URL (such as `git clone --depth 1 --branch v4.1.0 https://github.com/ecshop/ecshop.git .` or a direct link to a known zip file). After correcting the download step, the rest of the Dockerfile will run normally and the compose stack will start.
