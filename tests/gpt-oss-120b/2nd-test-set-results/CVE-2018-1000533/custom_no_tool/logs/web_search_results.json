    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111000533 is a server\u2011side template injection vulnerability in GitList versions up to and including 0.6. The vulnerable `searchTree` function concatenates user\u2011controlled input directly into a system call without any sanitisation or escaping. An attacker can submit a specially crafted POST request to the search form, causing the PHP process to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the web\u2011server user. This permits execution of any command the web\u2011server can run, leading to full compromise of the host running GitList. The flaw was fixed in GitList 0.7 (commit 87b8c26b023c3fc37f0796b14bb13710f397b322).",
