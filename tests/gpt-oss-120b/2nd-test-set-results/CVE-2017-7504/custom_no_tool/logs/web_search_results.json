    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20117504 is a remote, unauthenticated insecure deserialization vulnerability in the JBoss Application Server (JBoss AS) 4.x series. The flaw resides in the `HTTPServerILServlet` class, which implements the JMS\u2011over\u2011HTTP invocation layer of the JBossMQ messaging subsystem. The servlet accepts raw POST data, deserializes it without any class\u2011filtering or validation, and therefore an attacker can send a crafted Java serialized object that is deserialized on the server. This leads to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the JBoss process. Exploitation requires only network access to the servlet endpoint (default URL `http://<host>:8080/jbossmq-httpil/HTTPServerILServlet`) and does not require authentication.",
