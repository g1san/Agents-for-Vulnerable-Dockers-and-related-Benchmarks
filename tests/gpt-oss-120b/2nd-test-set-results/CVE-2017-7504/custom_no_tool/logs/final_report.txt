CVE description: CVE‑2017‑7504 is a remote, unauthenticated insecure deserialization vulnerability in the JBoss Application Server (JBoss AS) 4.x series. The flaw resides in the `HTTPServerILServlet` class, which implements the JMS‑over‑HTTP invocation layer of the JBossMQ messaging subsystem. The servlet accepts raw POST data, deserializes it without any class‑filtering or validation, and therefore an attacker can send a crafted Java serialized object that is deserialized on the server. This leads to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the JBoss process. Exploitation requires only network access to the servlet endpoint (default URL `http://<host>:8080/jbossmq-httpil/HTTPServerILServlet`) and does not require authentication.
Attack Type: remote insecure deserialization resulting in arbitrary code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only two services: a Python Flask web app (based on python:2.7-slim) and a MySQL database (image mysql:5.7). Neither service is jbossas, and no jbossas image or version appears in the Dockerfiles, images, or inspect output. Consequently, the required service jbossas is missing, and no matching hard‑coded version can be verified. Both milestones therefore fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only two services: a Python Flask web app (based on python:2.7-slim) and a MySQL database (image mysql:5.7). Neither service is jbossas, and no jbossas image or version appears in the Dockerfiles, images, or inspect output. Consequently, the required service jbossas is missing, and no matching hard‑coded version can be verified. Both milestones therefore fail.
	- FIX: To resolve the missing JBoss AS service, add a new service entry to the compose file that pulls a vulnerable JBoss AS 4.x image (for example jboss/base-jbossas:4.2.3) and exposes its HTTP port, then update the web service to depend on this JBoss container instead of the unrelated Flask app or simply replace the Flask service with the JBoss one if the test scenario requires the vulnerable servlet. Ensure the JBoss service’s environment and volume mounts match the version‑specific configuration so the `HTTPServerILServlet` endpoint is reachable at the expected URL. After adding the JBoss service and adjusting any dependent links, the composition will contain the required hard‑coded JBoss AS version.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build error is caused by using the legacy python:2.7‑slim image, which no longer ships a functional pip and cannot satisfy the old Flask 0.12 dependency; replace the base with a current slim Python image (for example python:3.9‑slim), update requirements.txt to a supported Flask version (e.g., Flask>=2.0) and then run pip install as before—this resolves the missing‑toolchain problem and allows the Dockerfile to complete successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the JBoss start‑up script isn’t executable (and, on some base images, the TLS certificates needed for the HTTPS download are missing), so the `wget` step either can’t fetch the archive or the container can’t later run `bin/run.sh`. To fix it, modify the JBoss Dockerfile to install `ca‑certificates` before the download, and add a `chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh` line after the move operation; you can also reference the script via the `$JBOSS_HOME` variable instead of a hard‑coded path. With those two changes the image will download, unpack, and launch JBoss without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the JBoss‑4.2.3 archive can’t be retrieved and the container also lacks a proper `JAVA_HOME` for the supplied run script; to cure both problems you can change the JBoss Dockerfile so that it (1) sets a Java home directory that the `run.sh` script expects, (2) uses a resilient download command (curl with `-L` to follow redirects) and (3) verifies that the archive actually exists before trying to unzip it. In practice you would replace the `wget` line with something like: 

```dockerfile
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl unzip ca-certificates && \
    curl -L -o /tmp/jboss.zip https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.2.3/jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip && \
    unzip /tmp/jboss.zip -d /opt && \
    mv /opt/jboss-4.2.3.GA $JBOSS_HOME && \
    rm /tmp/jboss.zip && \
    chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh
``` 

Adding the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and swapping `wget` for `curl -L` (which follows any moved‑resource redirects) resolves the download failure and gives the JBoss startup script the Java path it needs, allowing the image to be built successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the JBoss archive can’t be retrieved or unpacked as written – the URL in the Dockerfile points to a location that no longer serves the zip file (or the file name is slightly different), so the `curl` step returns a 404, leaving nothing for `unzip` to extract and causing the subsequent commands to error out. To fix it, change the download line to use the exact, currently‑available archive name (for example `https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.2.3/jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip`), or download a copy you host locally and copy it into the image with a `COPY` instruction; then keep the unzip step exactly as‑is. Also make sure the unzip utility is installed (the existing `apt‑get install unzip` line already does that) and that the `run.sh` script is marked executable before you try to start JBoss (the `chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh` line is fine). After correcting the URL (or swapping in a local copy) and rebuilding, the JBoss image should build successfully and the whole compose stack will start.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the JBoss 4.2.3 image is being assembled on a minimal JRE base that lacks a full JDK and a reliable JAVA_HOME path, so the startup script can’t find the compiler/runtime it expects; to fix it you can switch the base image to `openjdk:8-jdk-slim` (which provides the full JDK and a correct `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64` directory), keep the `apt‑get` line that installs `curl unzip ca-certificates`, and then run the same `curl…unzip…` sequence – the only other tweak is to ensure the `chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh` line runs after the zip is extracted (as it already does). After rebuilding with the JDK‑based image the container should start without the previous error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the JBoss archive URL is wrong – the 4.2.3 distribution is hosted under the *4.2.3.GA* directory, not *4.2.3*, so the curl request returns a 404 and unzip has nothing to extract. Change the `curl` line in `dockers/CVE-2017-7504/custom_no_tool/jboss/Dockerfile` to point to the correct location, for example:

```dockerfile
RUN curl -f -L -o /tmp/jboss.zip https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.2.3.GA/jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip \
    && unzip /tmp/jboss.zip -d /opt/ \
    && mv /opt/jboss-4.2.3.GA $JBOSS_HOME \
    && rm /tmp/jboss.zip \
    && chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh
```

After correcting the URL, the image downloads, extracts, and the Docker build proceeds without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the JBoss archive URL in the Dockerfile is incorrect, so the curl command downloads an HTML error page that unzip can’t extract; fixing it simply requires correcting the download link (for example, using `https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.2.3.GA/jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip` or another valid mirror), keeping the `apt-get install -y curl unzip` step, and then the `unzip` will produce the expected `jboss-4.2.3.GA` directory that can be moved to `/opt/jbossas`. After the archive is correctly extracted, the existing `chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh` and the CMD line work as intended, so the image builds without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the JBoss Dockerfile assumes the ZIP file will expand to a directory called `jboss-4.2.3.GA` and then moves that directory to `$JBOSS_HOME`; however the archive actually unpacks to a folder named `jboss-4.2.3.GA/` (with a trailing slash) and the `run.sh` script inside that folder isn’t marked executable after the move, so the subsequent `chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh` can’t find the file. Fix the Dockerfile by (1) unzipping the archive into a temporary location, (2) moving the exact extracted directory (`/opt/jboss-4.2.3.GA`) to `$JBOSS_HOME`, and (3) making the `run.sh` script executable after the move. A minimal change looks like this:

```dockerfile
# ... previous steps ...

RUN curl -f -L -o /tmp/jboss.zip https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.2.3.GA/jboss-4.2.3.GA.zip \
    && unzip /tmp/jboss.zip -d /opt/ \
    && mv /opt/jboss-4.2.3.GA $JBOSS_HOME \
    && rm /tmp/jboss.zip \
    && chmod +x $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh
```

If the URL no longer serves the file, replace it with a reachable mirror (for example `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/...`). After these adjustments the JBoss image builds successfully and the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
