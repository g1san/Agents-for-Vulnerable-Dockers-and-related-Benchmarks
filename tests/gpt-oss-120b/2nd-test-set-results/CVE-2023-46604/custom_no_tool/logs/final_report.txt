CVE description: CVE‑2023‑46604 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Java OpenWire protocol marshaller used by Apache ActiveMQ Classic and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. The marshaller deserializes class types received over the OpenWire wire protocol without proper validation. An attacker who can reach the OpenWire service (default port 61616) can send a specially‑crafted OpenWire command that forces the broker or any Java client to instantiate an arbitrary class present on its classpath with a single‑String argument. If the instantiated class contains code that runs on construction (for example Spring's ClassPathXmlApplicationContext loading a remote XML file), the attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the broker or client process. Exploitation requires only network connectivity to the OpenWire endpoint and a malicious payload; no additional services are required.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/activemq][['5.15.15', '5.16.6', '5.17.5', '5.18.2']] Apache ActiveMQ Classic broker that includes the vulnerable OpenWire marshaller. These specific versions are prior to the security fixes and are directly exploitable via crafted OpenWire payloads.
- [HARD][apache/activemq-artemis][['2.31.1']] Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker that can load the Classic OpenWire libraries. Version 2.31.1 contains the vulnerable marshaller code and can be exploited in the same way as the Classic broker.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile is based on `vulnerable/app:1.0` — a web‑app image that doesn’t contain the PostgreSQL entry‑point script infrastructure (`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`) and also expects a plain SQL file, not an executable script. To fix the problem, either change the base image of this Dockerfile to the official PostgreSQL image (so the init‑db directory exists) or, more cleanly, drop the Dockerfile entirely and let the `db` service initialise the database by mounting the SQL file as a volume. In practice you would remove the custom Dockerfile, add a volume mount in `docker‑compose.yml` under the `db` service like `- ./init-db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sql:ro`, and delete the `RUN chmod +x …` line because a `.sql` file does not need to be executable. This gives PostgreSQL the script it expects and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Add a top‑level `version` key (for example `version: "3.8"`) so Docker Compose knows which schema to validate, and make sure the indentation of each block is consistent; the YAML you posted is otherwise correct, but without the version field Compose may try to interpret the file with an unexpected default and fail during image preparation. Also verify that the Artemis service’s port mapping is exactly `"61617:61616"` (host 61617 → container 61616) and that no other container on the host is already bound to port 61616, because a port conflict will abort the compose up process. After adding the version line and confirming the port mapping and any existing host‑level bindings, the services should start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build‑time failure you should first verify that the compose file is syntactically correct and that each service can be started independently; the most common issue in this file is the port mapping for the Artemis container – the host port (61617) is being bound to the same container port (61616) that the ActiveMQ service already exposes, which can cause a bind conflict if both containers try to listen on the same host interface. Change the mapping to something like "61617:61617" (or any unused host port) and update the environment variable name to match the Artemis image’s expected variables (for example ARTEMIS_USER and ARTEMIS_PASSWORD instead of ARTEMIS_USERNAME/ARTEMIS_PASSWORD if required). After correcting the port mapping and ensuring the environment variable names are valid for the chosen images, run docker‑compose up again; the containers should start without the previous error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the two containers try to bind the same internal port (61616) on the host and the Activemq image does not recognize the VULN_MODE variable, causing the container to fail at start‑up; you can resolve this by removing the unsupported VULN_MODE environment line from the activemq service and assigning a different host port to one of the brokers— for example, keep “61616:61616” for the activemq service and change the artemis mapping to “61617:61616” (or any free port) while retaining its required AR­TEMIS_USER and AR­TEMIS_PASSWORD variables. After these adjustments the compose file will start both images without conflicts.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is likely due to the fact that the compose file only references pre‑built images, so the error actually occurs when Docker tries to pull one of them; the “activemq” service uses the tag 5.17.5 which does not exist in the rmohr/activemq repository (the official tags stop at 5.17.4), causing a “manifest not found” error. To fix it, change the image reference to a valid tag such as rmohr/activemq:5.17.4 or use the updated official image apache/activemq:5.17.5 instead. Additionally, the Artemis service maps its internal 61616 port to the host’s 61617, which is fine, but make sure the environment variables are correctly indented under the service definition (they already are) and that Docker has internet access to pull both images; after correcting the activemq tag the compose file will start both containers without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Add a version line at the top of the compose file (for example `version: "3.8"`), then make sure the service definitions are correctly indented under it; this satisfies the Compose schema and stops the parser from failing. If the error was due to a port conflict, keep the host‑to‑container mapping as‑is (61616 → 61616 for the ActiveMQ service and 61617 → 61616 for the Artemis service) so each container listens on its own host port. After inserting the version key and confirming the YAML indentation, the file should load and the containers will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file isn’t actually building anything, it’s just pulling images, so the failure is coming from an invalid image reference or a port conflict. The quickest fix is to point each service to a tag that really exists and make sure the host ports don’t clash. Replace the “rmohr/activemq:5.17.5” line with a known‑good image such as “apache/activemq:5.17.5” (or the exact tag that matches the vulnerable version you need), and keep the Artemis service as is – its host‑to‑container port mapping (61617:61616) is already distinct from the ActiveMQ mapping (61616:61616). After correcting the image name, `docker compose up` will pull the proper layers and the stack will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is valid YAML, but the error comes from Docker Compose expecting a version header and from the two services trying to bind the same internal port without any network isolation conflict. Adding a top‑level `version: "3.9"` (or any supported version) line fixes the parsing problem, and explicitly naming a custom bridge network (or simply leaving the default network) ensures each container can use its own 61616 port internally while only the host ports differ. So insert `version: "3.9"` as the first line, keep the rest of the file unchanged, and Docker Compose will start both images without the build‑time failure.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the Artemis service maps the container’s 61616 port to host 61617 but does not expose the internal port that the image actually listens on; the image expects the environment variable ARTEMIS_INSTANCE to point to a running broker, and without a volume for the data directory the container crashes on startup. To fix it, change the ports line to map the same internal port (61616) to the host port you want (for example "61617:61616") and add a persistent volume for the broker’s data (e.g., volumes: - artemis-data:/var/lib/artemis-instance). Also ensure the environment variables are correctly indented under the artemis service. After correcting the port mapping and adding the volume, docker‑compose up will build and start both containers without errors.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
