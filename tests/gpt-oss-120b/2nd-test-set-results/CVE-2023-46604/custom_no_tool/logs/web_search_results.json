    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201146604 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Java OpenWire protocol marshaller used by Apache ActiveMQ Classic and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. The marshaller deserializes class types received over the OpenWire wire protocol without proper validation. An attacker who can reach the OpenWire service (default port 61616) can send a specially\u2011crafted OpenWire command that forces the broker or any Java client to instantiate an arbitrary class present on its classpath with a single\u2011String argument. If the instantiated class contains code that runs on construction (for example Spring's ClassPathXmlApplicationContext loading a remote XML file), the attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the broker or client process. Exploitation requires only network connectivity to the OpenWire endpoint and a malicious payload; no additional services are required.",
