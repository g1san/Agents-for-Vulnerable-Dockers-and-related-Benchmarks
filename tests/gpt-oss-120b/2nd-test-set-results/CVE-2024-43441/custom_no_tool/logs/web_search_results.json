    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201143441 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph\u2011Server. The flaw exists in the server\u2019s handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The server treats the JWT secret as immutable, but an attacker can forge or replay tokens because the secret can be altered or is effectively empty. This allows an unauthenticated adversary to obtain full access to the graph database, read, modify, or delete graph data, and change server configuration. The vulnerability is classified as Authentication Bypass by Assumed\u2011Immutable Data (CWE\u2011302) and receives a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical). Public exploits are available and the vulnerability can be triggered remotely against any exposed HugeGraph endpoint. The issue is present in all HugeGraph\u2011Server releases from version 1.0.0 up to, and including, the last 1.4.x release. It is fixed in version 1.5.0 and later.",
