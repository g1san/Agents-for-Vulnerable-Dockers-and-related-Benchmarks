    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201116509 is a vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter. Versions of Ghostscript earlier than 9.24 contain an unsafe handling of the /invalidaccess exception that allows the internal -dSAFER sandbox protection to be bypassed. By supplying a crafted PostScript or EPS file that triggers a failed grestore, an attacker can cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary shell commands (for example via the \\%pipe% instruction). The flaw is typically reached when an application such as Python's Pillow library invokes Ghostscript to rasterize EPS/PS images. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution with the privileges of the process running Ghostscript.",
