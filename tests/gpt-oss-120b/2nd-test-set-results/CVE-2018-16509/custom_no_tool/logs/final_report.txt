CVE description: CVE‑2018‑16509 is a vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter. Versions of Ghostscript earlier than 9.24 contain an unsafe handling of the /invalidaccess exception that allows the internal -dSAFER sandbox protection to be bypassed. By supplying a crafted PostScript or EPS file that triggers a failed grestore, an attacker can cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary shell commands (for example via the \%pipe% instruction). The flaw is typically reached when an application such as Python's Pillow library invokes Ghostscript to rasterize EPS/PS images. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution with the privileges of the process running Ghostscript.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `python:2.7‑slim` image no longer contains a version of pip that can install packages for an EOL interpreter – the pip that ships with that image has already dropped Python 2 support, so the `pip install Flask==0.12 mysql‑connector‑python==2.1.7` step aborts. The quickest fix is to switch the base image to a still‑supported Python version, keep the same (or a newer) Flask release that still works with the exploit demo, and make sure pip is upgraded before installing the requirements. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to:

```
FROM python:3.9‑slim

# upgrade pip to a version that can still install the old packages
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip==20.3.4

# install the vulnerable Flask version and its MySQL driver
RUN pip install Flask==0.12 mysql‑connector‑python==2.1.7

WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This replacement restores a functional pip, lets the legacy package versions install, and eliminates the build‑time error while preserving the intended vulnerable behavior for the CVE‑2018‑16509 demonstration. (If you prefer to stay on Python 2 you would have to pin an older pip release manually, but moving to Python 3.9‑slim is simpler and more reliable.)


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most likely reason the “web” service can’t start is that Flask 0.12 is not compatible with the Python 3.9‑slim base image, so the pip install fails and the container exits before it even runs the application; additionally the app never installs Pillow or Ghostscript, which are required for the CVE‑2018‑16509 exploitation path. To fix it, change the Dockerfile to use a supported Flask release (for example Flask==2.2.5), add a `pip install Pillow==9.5.0 ghostscript` line, and rebuild the image; once the build succeeds the container will launch and you can then address the deliberate SQL‑injection bug in app.py if needed.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs Ghostscript via `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript` without pinning a specific version. On the base image python:3.9-slim (Debian based) the package resolves to a recent Ghostscript release (e.g., 9.55 or newer), which is not included in the provided vulnerable version list (which stops at 9.23). Therefore the image does not use a vulnerable Ghostscript version. All other required services (python, Flask, Pillow) are present, so the services_ok milestone passes.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile installs Ghostscript via `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript` without pinning a specific version. On the base image python:3.9-slim (Debian based) the package resolves to a recent Ghostscript release (e.g., 9.55 or newer), which is not included in the provided vulnerable version list (which stops at 9.23). Therefore the image does not use a vulnerable Ghostscript version. All other required services (python, Flask, Pillow) are present, so the services_ok milestone passes.
	- FIX: To make the container actually run a vulnerable Ghostscript version you need to pin the package to one of the affected releases, for example by changing the install line in the Dockerfile to `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript=9.22* && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, or by adding a specific Debian repository that contains the older 9.22 package and then installing that exact version. Alternatively you could base the image on an older Debian/Ubuntu tag that still ships the vulnerable Ghostscript version and then install it without a version range. In either case the key change is to replace the unpinned `apt-get install ghostscript` with a command that explicitly installs a Ghostscript version listed as vulnerable.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Debian‑based python:3.9‑slim image’s package index does not contain a “ghostscript=9.22*” package, so the apt‑get line cannot satisfy the version pin; to fix it, remove the version constraint (or replace it with a source‑compile step) and drop the pip‑installed ghostscript wrapper if you only need the binary – for example, change the Dockerfile to install the default ghostscript package with `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript` (or add a step that downloads the 9.22 tarball, builds it with `./configure && make && make install`), then remove the separate `pip install ghostscript` line, which eliminates the conflicting version requirement and allows the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs Ghostscript with `apt-get install ghostscript`, which pulls the default package from the underlying Debian distribution used by the python:3.9-slim base image. That package version is a recent release (e.g., 9.55.x or later) and is not included in the allowed vulnerable versions list (9.23‑9.00, 8.71‑7.07). Consequently the `code_hard_version` milestone is not met. All required services—ghostscript, python, flask, and pillow—are present in the image, so the `services_ok` milestone is satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile installs Ghostscript with `apt-get install ghostscript`, which pulls the default package from the underlying Debian distribution used by the python:3.9-slim base image. That package version is a recent release (e.g., 9.55.x or later) and is not included in the allowed vulnerable versions list (9.23‑9.00, 8.71‑7.07). Consequently the `code_hard_version` milestone is not met. All required services—ghostscript, python, flask, and pillow—are present in the image, so the `services_ok` milestone is satisfied.
	- FIX: To meet the code_hard_version milestone you replace the generic apt‑get install ghostscript command with a step that fetches and installs a Ghostscript release that lies in the vulnerable range (for example 9.23). This can be done by adding a wget or curl download of the .deb package from a Debian snapshot repository for the exact version, installing it with dpkg -i and then cleaning the apt cache, or by building Ghostscript 9.23 from source and copying the binaries into the image. After that the rest of the Dockerfile (Python, Flask, Pillow, MySQL, and the app code) remains unchanged, satisfying both the version constraint and the required services.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the snapshot repository you add does not contain a matching package index entry for the exact ghostscript version you request, so apt cannot resolve `ghostscript=9.23-0`. Fix it by pointing the snapshot to a date that actually includes that package (for example `20210201T000000Z` for stretch) and by installing the full ghostscript suite (the binary plus its data package) in a single apt command. In the Dockerfile replace the current “install ghostscript” block with something like:

```dockerfile
# add a stretch snapshot that has the 9.23 packages
RUN echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20210201T000000Z stretch main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/snapshot.list && \
    apt-get update -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript=9.23-0 libgs9-common=9.23-0 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /etc/apt/sources.list.d/snapshot.list
```

If the exact version still cannot be found, drop the version pinning and let apt pull the highest‑available 9.23‑series package:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript=9.23*
```

Either approach ensures apt can locate a satisfying package, eliminates the “Unable to locate package” error, and lets the image build successfully. No other code changes are required.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the snapshot repository you add does not contain the exact “9.23‑0” package identifiers, so the apt‑install line cannot resolve the Ghostscript binaries and their dependencies. The simplest fix is to pull the older Ghostscript version from a snapshot that actually ships the matching package names (for example the Debian 9 “stretch” snapshot from 2021‑02‑01) and to install it with a wildcard version selector, or just drop the explicit version pins entirely and let apt pick the best available 9.23 release from that snapshot. In practice you can change the Dockerfile’s Ghostscript installation block to first add the snapshot source, run apt‑get update, then run apt‑get install -y --no-install-recommends ghostscript=9.23* libgs9-common=9.23* (or omit the version numbers), and finally clean the apt cache; this will let the image build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the snapshot repository you add doesn’t contain the exact package names you request on the python:3.9‑slim (base bookworm) image, so apt can’t resolve ghostscript=9.23* and libgs9-common=9.23*. Fix it by either pulling the vulnerable Ghostscript from a source that matches the base distro (for example, add the official Debian stretch repository and install the exact version numbers that exist there) or by building Ghostscript from source inside the Dockerfile. In practice you can replace the current RUN block with one that adds the stretch archive, runs apt‑get update, installs the exact package versions (e.g. ghostscript=9.23~dfsg-1 and libgs9-common=9.23~dfsg-1), and then cleans up, or you can download the .deb files for 9.23 from snapshot.debian.org and install them with dpkg -i instead of using the wildcard selector. Either approach ensures the packages are found and the image builds successfully.
