CVE description: CVE-2014-3704, known as Drupalgeddon, is a pre‑authentication SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal core 7.x. The flaw resides in the `expandArguments()` function of Drupal's database abstraction layer, which improperly builds prepared statements. By supplying specially crafted array keys in request parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands. The vulnerability affects all Drupal 7 releases prior to 7.32, allowing remote unauthenticated execution of SQL that can lead to data theft, modification, creation of new administrative accounts, and full system compromise.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][drupal][['7.0-apache', '7.1-apache', '7.2-apache', '7.3-apache', '7.4-apache', '7.5-apache', '7.6-apache', '7.7-apache', '7.8-apache', '7.9-apache', '7.10-apache', '7.11-apache', '7.12-apache', '7.13-apache', '7.14-apache', '7.15-apache', '7.16-apache', '7.17-apache', '7.18-apache', '7.19-apache', '7.20-apache', '7.21-apache', '7.22-apache', '7.23-apache', '7.24-apache', '7.25-apache', '7.26-apache', '7.27-apache', '7.28-apache', '7.29-apache', '7.30-apache', '7.31-apache']] Drupal core provides the vulnerable application component; specific Drupal 7 versions prior to 7.32 contain the SQL injection flaw.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] MySQL supplies the database backend required by Drupal; any compatible version works with the vulnerable Drupal images.

	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑5.6 image you’re using does not contain the old `mysql_*` functions that the custom Drupal driver calls – those functions were removed from PHP long ago and are not compiled into the official `php:5.6‑apache` runtime. To get the image to compile you have two options: either install the legacy mysql extension (which is no longer provided in the official image) or, far better, rewrite the driver to use the modern mysqli/PDO API that is available in the base image.

The quickest fix is to change the Dockerfile so the mysqli extension is compiled and then modify the driver to call `mysqli_query` (or PDO) instead of `mysql_query`. In the Dockerfile add `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` (or `pdo_mysql` if you prefer PDO) to the list of extensions that are installed. Then replace the three `mysql_query` calls in `mysql.inc` with their mysqli equivalents – for example, create a global `$mysqli` connection when the container starts (using the same environment variables) and do `mysqli_query($mysqli, $query)` in `db_query`. Also drop the `@vsprintf` line or, even better, stop interpolating arguments directly and use prepared statements, but keeping the string interpolation for a minimal change will at least let the image build and run.

In short: add the mysqli extension in the Dockerfile, change the driver to use `mysqli_query` (or PDO) instead of the removed `mysql_*` functions, and the image will build without errors. This also moves the code away from the deprecated API, making the container more stable.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Drupal service is built from the Dockerfile using the base image php:5.6-apache, which does not match any of the allowed Drupal version tags (7.0‑apache through 7.31‑apache). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. The compose file does include both drupal and mysql services, so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Drupal service is built from the Dockerfile using the base image php:5.6-apache, which does not match any of the allowed Drupal version tags (7.0‑apache through 7.31‑apache). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. The compose file does include both drupal and mysql services, so the 'services_ok' milestone is satisfied.
	- FIX: Replace the custom PHP 5.6‑Apache image with the official Drupal image that matches the required tag, for example change the Dockerfile to use `FROM drupal:7.31-apache` (or another 7.x tag up to 7.31) and remove the manual copy of the Drupal source; the official image already contains the correct code layout. Adjust the compose file so the drupal service builds from this updated Dockerfile (or simply reference the image directly with image: drupal:7.31-apache) and keep the environment variables for the database connection. This aligns the service with the allowed Drupal version tags and satisfies the code_hard_version milestone while preserving the existing MySQL service.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to compile the mysqli extension on the drupal:7.31‑apache image without first installing the build tools and header files that the PHP‑extension installer needs, and it also references a source directory that isn’t present in the build context. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so that it first updates the package list and installs the required development packages (for example apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev && docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli), then copy the vulnerable Drupal files from the correct relative path (e.g. COPY ./drupal/ /var/www/html/ instead of COPY drupal/ /var/www/html/ if the drupal folder lives next to the Dockerfile). After these two adjustments the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the MySQL client development package name used in the Dockerfile does not exist in the underlying Debian release, so the apt‑get step aborts before the docker-php-ext-install command can run; replace default-libmysqlclient-dev with the correct package name (e.g., libmysqlclient-dev) and keep default-mysql-client as is, then the docker-php-ext-install mysqli step will succeed. After fixing the package name, the image will compile the mysqli extension, the COPY of the Drupal source will proceed, and the container will start without a build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Drupal‑7.31 image does not contain the helper script **docker‑php‑ext‑install** or the PHP development headers that are required to compile the mysqli extension, so the `RUN … && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && …` line aborts. Fix the problem by installing the PHP‑dev package (and the build‑essential tools it depends on) before invoking the helper, or by switching to a base image that already provides the helper (e.g. the official `php:5.6-apache` image) and then adding Drupal on top of it. In practice you can change the Dockerfile to first `apt-get install -y php5-dev default-mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli` (or the equivalent `php-dev` package for the PHP version in the base), then continue with the rest of the steps. This supplies the missing compiler headers and makes the `docker-php-ext-install` command succeed, allowing the image to build correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile assumes it is running on an official **php‑*‑apache** image (where the helper script `docker-php-ext-install` and the meta‑package `php5-dev` exist), but the base you are using – `drupal:7.31‑apache` – is a Debian‑based image that does not provide those items. To fix it, replace the “install PHP extensions” block with the packages that actually exist in that distribution and enable the mysqli extension the Debian way. For example, change the RUN line to update the package list, install `php5-mysql` (or `php-mysql` on newer Debian releases) together with any build tools you really need, and drop the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` call; then clean up the apt cache. After that the rest of the Dockerfile (copying the vulnerable code and fixing ownership) will run without errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base image drupal:7.31‑apache uses PHP 5.6 on a Debian‑based distribution where the package name is php5-mysql only on older releases, so the apt‑get line cannot find it; replace that line with the generic php-mysql (or the exact versioned package matching the PHP version in the image, e.g. php5.6-mysql or php7.0-mysql) and be sure to enable the mysqli extension, then remove the stray back‑slash after the COPY command if the path drupal/ does not exist relative to the build context. After adjusting the package name and confirming the copy source directory is correct, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base **php:5.6‑apache** image no longer provides a `php5‑mysql` Debian package, so the `apt‑get install php5‑mysql` line aborts with “package not found”. Replace that line with the official PHP extension installer that comes with the image: after installing the build‑time libraries (`libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev git wget`), run `docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo_mysql` (or just `mysqli` if you only need the global `$mysqli` you create). Remove `php5‑mysql` from the apt list, keep the other packages, and clean up the apt cache as before. This change supplies the same MySQLi functionality the driver expects while allowing the image to compile successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to copy a directory named `drupal/` from the build context into `/var/www/html/`, but that folder never exists – the Drupal source is downloaded into `/usr/src/drupal` inside the image and never moved out. To fix it, replace the `COPY drupal/ /var/www/html/` instruction with a command that copies the files that were just extracted, for example:

```dockerfile
# after the wget…tar line
RUN cp -R /usr/src/drupal/. /var/www/html/
```

or, if you prefer a separate build stage, use a multi‑stage build and `COPY --from=builder /usr/src/drupal/ /var/www/html/`. This ensures the web root actually receives the Drupal files and eliminates the “no such file or directory” error that stops the image from being built. Once the correct copy is in place, the rest of the Dockerfile (PHP extensions, permissions, etc.) will execute without further changes.
