    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u201120933 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the HTTP API of InfluxDB, a time\u2011series database. The flaw resides in the `authenticate` function of `services/httpd/handler.go`, where a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains an empty `SharedSecret` field is incorrectly accepted as valid. Consequently, an attacker can craft a JWT with an empty shared secret, send it to the InfluxDB HTTP endpoint (default port 8086), and obtain unauthenticated access to the query API. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary InfluxQL statements, read or write any database, create or drop databases, and potentially achieve code execution through specially crafted queries. The vulnerability affects all InfluxDB releases up to and including version 1.7.5. It was fixed in version 1.7.6, where the JWT validation logic was updated to reject tokens with an empty shared secret. Exploits are publicly available and require only the vulnerable InfluxDB service; no additional services are required to reproduce the issue.",
