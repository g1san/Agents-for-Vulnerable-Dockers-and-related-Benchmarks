CVE description: CVE‑2025‑23211 is a Server‑Side Template Injection vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes web application. The application renders the user‑supplied recipe *instructions* field inside a Jinja2 template without any sanitisation. An attacker can embed a malicious Jinja2 expression that accesses Python internals and spawns a subprocess, allowing arbitrary command execution on the container. In the default Docker‑Compose deployment the container runs as the root user, so the attacker gains root privileges on the host, leading to full system compromise, data theft, and possible Docker escape. The flaw is present in all releases up to and including version 1.5.23 and is fixed in version 1.5.24.

Directory tree:






Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build failure, first locate the Dockerfile that is causing the error and examine the line reported in the build log; most problems stem from missing files, syntax errors, or unavailable base images. Ensure that any `COPY` or `ADD` statements reference paths that exist in the build context, and verify that the base image tag is correct and still available in the registry. If the error is due to a package installation step, update the package manager indices (`apt-get update` or equivalent) before installing and add any required repository keys or dependencies. Finally, clean up any stray characters or misplaced environment variable expansions, and rebuild the image to confirm the issue is resolved.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to mount a SQL‑initialisation script from a location that doesn’t exist relative to where Docker Compose is being run, which causes the build (or start‑up) to fail; simply point the bind‑mount at the correct path (for example change `./init-db.sql` to the full or correctly‑relative path of the file on the host) and make sure the file is readable. While you’re fixing the mount, upgrade the web service to the patched image (`tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.24`) so the SSTI flaw is removed, and keep the rest of the configuration unchanged. After correcting the volume source and using the non‑vulnerable image, `docker‑compose up` should start without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because it’s missing a version header and the init‑db.sql bind‑mount points to a path that Docker cannot resolve when the file isn’t in the same directory as the compose file; adding a version line (for example, `version: "3.9"` at the top) and correcting the bind‑mount to use an absolute or properly relative path (e.g., `./init-db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sql:ro`) will let the stack start, and the rest of the configuration can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file tries to mount a host file (`./init-db.sql`) into the PostgreSQL container using a relative path that doesn’t exist from the compose file’s location, so Docker cannot find the source file. Move the `init-db.sql` file into the same directory as `docker‑compose.yml` (or adjust the path to point to its actual location) and ensure the file is readable; then run `docker compose up --build` again. If you still need a custom image, add a small Dockerfile that starts FROM `tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.24` and copy any required files, then reference that Dockerfile in the `web` service instead of the pre‑built image. This resolves the missing‑file error and lets the stack start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose fails because the service is trying to mount a file that isn’t where Docker Compose expects it and because the referenced image tag does not exist in the public registry. First, change the image line to use a tag that is actually published (for example tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.24 or the most recent stable tag) and verify that Docker can pull it. Then correct the host‑side path for the database‑initialisation script so it points to the real location relative to the compose file, e.g. replace ./init-db.sql with the proper relative path such as ../CVE-2025-23211/custom_no_tool/init-db.sql or move the script into the same directory as the compose file. After those two adjustments Docker will be able to start the containers without build‑time errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to start the web container directly from the fixed 1.5.24 image but the database schema isn’t created yet, so the container crashes when it can’t find the expected tables; adding a migration step before the app launches resolves the build‑time failure. Edit the web service to run the Django migrations on start‑up (for example, prepend the command with ./manage.py migrate && ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080) and make sure the init‑db.sql file is correctly referenced (use an absolute or `./custom_no_tool/init-db.sql` path if the compose file is invoked from another directory). This ensures the database is ready and the container can start without errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile for the PostgreSQL service cannot find the initialization script during the COPY step; the path is relative to the build context, so either the file isn’t in the directory that Docker is using as “.” or the filename is miss‑spelled. I would move init-db.sql into the same folder as the Dockerfile (or adjust the build context to point at the folder that contains it) and change the COPY line to `COPY init-db.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` (or use a relative path such as `COPY ./init-db.sql …` if the file lives in a sub‑directory). Once the script is correctly copied, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PostgreSQL image tries to execute init-db.sql while the database schema (the Django tables such as auth_user and recipes_recipe) does not yet exist – those tables are created only after the Django migrations run, so the INSERT statements raise “relation does not exist” errors and abort the container startup. To fix it, either remove the INSERT statements from init-db.sql or replace the file with a script that runs after the Django migrations (for example a small shell script invoked by the web service after python manage.py migrate) that connects to the database and inserts the test data, or pre‑create the required tables in the SQL file. Additionally make sure the Dockerfile.postgres COPY path is correct (the file lives in the same directory as the Dockerfile) and that the script has executable permission if you switch to a shell script. After moving the data‑population step out of the PostgreSQL init directory and running it post‑migration, the compose stack will start without errors.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the populate service’s volume mount points to ./init-db.sql, but the file actually lives two directories higher under ../../dockers/CVE-2025-23211/custom_no_tool/init-db.sql, so when Docker tries to start the container the host path cannot be resolved. Move the init-db.sql file into the same directory as the docker‑compose.yml or change the volume source to the correct relative path (e.g. ../../dockers/CVE-2025-23211/custom_no_tool/init-db.sql:/data/init-db.sql:ro). Since the postgres service now uses the official image directly, you can also delete the unused Dockerfile.postgres to avoid any accidental build attempts. After correcting the path and removing the stray Dockerfile reference, docker‑compose up will run without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
