    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u201123211 is a Server\u2011Side Template Injection vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes web application. The application renders the user\u2011supplied recipe *instructions* field inside a Jinja2 template without any sanitisation. An attacker can embed a malicious Jinja2 expression that accesses Python internals and spawns a subprocess, allowing arbitrary command execution on the container. In the default Docker\u2011Compose deployment the container runs as the root user, so the attacker gains root privileges on the host, leading to full system compromise, data theft, and possible Docker escape. The flaw is present in all releases up to and including version 1.5.23 and is fixed in version 1.5.24.",
