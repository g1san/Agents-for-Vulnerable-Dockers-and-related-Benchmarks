    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201136401 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the open\u2011source GeoServer geospatial server. The flaw resides in GeoServer\u2019s handling of property\u2011name expressions (XPath) within the GeoTools library. User\u2011supplied OGC request parameters such as those in WFS GetFeature, GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, GetFeatureInfo, GetLegendGraphic, and WPS Execute are interpreted as XPath expressions by the Apache Commons JXPath engine. Because the evaluation is performed without proper sanitisation, an attacker can inject malicious Java code (for example `${java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('cmd')}`) that is executed by the Java Virtual Machine running GeoServer. The vulnerability is unauthenticated and actively exploited in the wild, enabling threat actors to download and run arbitrary scripts, backdoors, and malware on the compromised host. Affected GeoServer releases are all versions prior to the security\u2011fixed releases 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2. Patching to any of these fixed versions or later eliminates the flaw; a temporary mitigation is the removal of the vulnerable GeoTools complex module JARs, though this may break functionality.",
