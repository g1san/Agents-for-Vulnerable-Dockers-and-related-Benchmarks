----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2024‑36401 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the open‑source GeoServer geospatial server. The flaw resides in GeoServer’s handling of property‑name expressions (XPath) within the GeoTools library. User‑supplied OGC request parameters such as those in WFS GetFeature, GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, GetFeatureInfo, GetLegendGraphic, and WPS Execute are interpreted as XPath expressions by the Apache Commons JXPath engine. Because the evaluation is performed without proper sanitisation, an attacker can inject malicious Java code (for example `${java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('cmd')}`) that is executed by the Java Virtual Machine running GeoServer. The vulnerability is unauthenticated and actively exploited in the wild, enabling threat actors to download and run arbitrary scripts, backdoors, and malware on the compromised host. Affected GeoServer releases are all versions prior to the security‑fixed releases 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2. Patching to any of these fixed versions or later eliminates the flaw; a temporary mitigation is the removal of the vulnerable GeoTools complex module JARs, though this may break functionality.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines two services only: 'vulnerable-redis' (based on redis:6.2.5) and 'vulnerable-app' (built from a Python 3.10‑slim image). No service uses the 'geoserver' image, and therefore no version of geoserver is present to be checked against the allowed version list. Consequently the 'services_ok' milestone fails because the required 'geoserver' service is missing, and the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails because no geoserver version is used.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines two services only: 'vulnerable-redis' (based on redis:6.2.5) and 'vulnerable-app' (built from a Python 3.10‑slim image). No service uses the 'geoserver' image, and therefore no version of geoserver is present to be checked against the allowed version list. Consequently the 'services_ok' milestone fails because the required 'geoserver' service is missing, and the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails because no geoserver version is used.
	- FIX: Add a GeoServer container to the compose file using an image version that is patched against CVE‑2024‑36401 (for example geoserver:2.25.2 or a later tag), and expose the ports you need. Then make the Python app talk to GeoServer instead of—or in addition to—the Redis service, supplying the correct host and port via environment variables. By including the required hardened GeoServer service with a safe version, the composition will satisfy both the “services_ok” and “code_hard_version” checks.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the python:3.10‑slim image doesn’t contain the curl binary that the health‑check later expects, and the pip version in that slim image can be too old to reliably resolve the three pure‑Python dependencies. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile so that it first updates the package index and installs curl (and any other minimal utilities you might need), upgrades pip, and then installs the requirements; for example, add a line like `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`. This ensures the container can be built successfully and the health‑check can run without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Docker‑Compose cannot find the Dockerfile for the hardened‑geoserver service – the relative `build: ./geoserver` path is wrong from the location of the compose file, so the context is pointing at a non‑existent directory. Change the compose entry to give an explicit context (for example `build: {context: ./geoserver, dockerfile: Dockerfile}` or adjust the relative path so it points at the actual folder that contains the Dockerfile). Once the correct build context is supplied, the image builds successfully and the rest of the stack can start.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the *hardened‑geoserver* service referencing a pre‑built image (`kartoza/geoserver:2.25.2`) while you also ship a custom Dockerfile in `geoserver/Dockerfile`. Because the compose file never tells Docker to use that Dockerfile, the image it pulls does not contain **curl**, so the health‑check command cannot be executed and the service aborts during startup.  

Fix it by making the service build from the local Dockerfile (or by removing the Dockerfile altogether). In the compose file replace the `image:` line with a `build:` stanza that points at the `geoserver` directory, for example:

```yaml
hardened-geoserver:
  build: ./geoserver
  ports:
    - "8081:8080"
  environment:
    - GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD","curl","-f","http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
```

Now Docker will use your custom Dockerfile (which installs curl), the health‑check will succeed, and the compose stack will start without the previous error. If you prefer to keep the pre‑built image, simply remove the custom Dockerfile and add curl to the base image by extending it in a separate Dockerfile and referencing that new image. Either way, aligning the service definition with the Dockerfile resolves the build/run problem.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the osgeo/geoserver image runs as a non‑root user, so the apt‑get commands in the geoserver/Dockerfile fail with permission errors. Add a temporary switch to the root user before the package install and then revert to the original user (or the geoserver user) afterwards; for example, insert `USER root` before the RUN apt‑get … line and `USER geoserver` (or the appropriate user) after it. This lets the curl package be installed and the health‑check succeed, allowing the image to build without modifying any other files.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile for the GeoServer service is trying to pull a non‑existent image named `geoserver:2.25.2`; the official GeoServer images are published under the `osgeo/geoserver` namespace, so you should change the first line to `FROM osgeo/geoserver:2.25.2`. After that, keep the rest of the Dockerfile as‑is (installing curl as root and then switching back to the `geoserver` user) and the image will build correctly. If the healthcheck still errors, point it at the container’s internal port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web`) which is already the case, so no further change is needed.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the GeoServer image you are extending does not contain the curl binary that the health‑check in the compose file expects, so the container aborts as soon as the health‑check is started. The simplest way to fix it is to install curl inside the GeoServer image **before** the health‑check can run and to make sure the image is built with the correct user permissions. Edit the geoserver/Dockerfile so that the `apt‑get` line is executed **before** the `USER geoserver` line (as you already do) and then add a small `RUN` step that verifies curl exists; this guarantees the binary is present when Docker starts the container and the health‑check executes. After rebuilding the geoserver service the compose file will start without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile switches to a user that doesn’t exist in the base GeoServer image and then tries to install packages as that user; the apt‑get step therefore runs without the required privileges and aborts. To fix it, keep the container running as root while you install curl, then switch back to the correct, existing GeoServer user (which is `jetty` in the official image) before completing the Dockerfile. In the compose file, make sure the health‑check points at the internal port (8080) that the container actually listens on; the published port (8081) is only for the host and doesn’t affect the health‑check. Updating the Dockerfile accordingly resolves the build error and lets the service start correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the hardened‑geoserver image is being created without curl available when the health‑check is executed – the health‑check runs against the container’s *internal* port 8080, but the base osgeo/geoserver image doesn’t ship curl, so the test command can’t be found. Fix it by installing curl in the same layer where you switch back to the jetty user (or simply keep the container as root until the health‑check finishes) and make sure the health‑check URL matches the internal service port (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web`). In practice you can modify the geoserver/Dockerfile to install curl before the USER jetty line (or add a RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl after the USER jetty line) and then rebuild; the compose file can stay unchanged because the port mapping already exposes the service on 8081 externally while the container itself still listens on 8080. This small change supplies the missing binary and resolves the build‑time error.
