CVE description: CVE‑2019‑6341 is a stored and reflected cross‑site scripting vulnerability in the core File module of the Drupal content management system. The flaw allows an attacker to upload a file that is identified as an image (for example a crafted GIF) but actually contains arbitrary HTML or JavaScript. Drupal stores the file unchanged in the public files directory (`/sites/default/files/pictures/<YYYY‑MM>/`) and serves it with a MIME type that browsers interpret as HTML. When a victim (including an authenticated administrator) accesses the URL of the uploaded file, the embedded script executes in the context of the vulnerable site, enabling cookie theft, session hijacking, phishing, or further privilege escalation. The vulnerability is present in all Drupal 7 releases prior to 7.65 and in Drupal 8 releases prior to 8.5.14 and 8.6.13. It is mitigated by upgrading to Drupal 7.65, 8.5.14, 8.6.13, or any later version, and by tightening file‑type validation and MIME‑type checks on uploads.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile assumes a package‑lock.json file is present and runs `npm ci --only=production`. In this source tree only package.json exists, so `npm ci` aborts with “cannot find package‑lock.json”. Change the Dockerfile to install dependencies with the regular `npm install` command (or generate a lock file locally and copy it in). For example, replace the line  

```dockerfile
RUN npm ci --only=production
```  

with  

```dockerfile
RUN npm install --production
```  

and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged. This lets the image build successfully while still installing only the production dependencies required by the app. If you later need reproducible builds, you can generate a lock file locally (`npm ci` on your host) and add it to the COPY statement.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to copy package‑lock.json even though that file isn’t present in the source tree, so the `COPY package.json package-lock.json ./` step aborts. The simplest fix is to either add a proper package‑lock.json to the webapp directory or edit the Dockerfile so it only copies the existing package.json (e.g. `COPY package.json ./`). After that change the `npm install --production` step will run normally and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common cause for the mongo service not becoming healthy is the healthcheck’s use of “localhost”, which inside the container does not resolve to the Mongo server because it is bound to all interfaces; change the test to point at the container name (mongo) – for example: test: ["CMD","sh","-c","mongo --host mongo --eval \"db.runCommand({ping:1})\""] – and the healthcheck will succeed, allowing the dependent initmongo service to run and the webapp to connect. If you prefer to simplify the composition, you can also drop the separate initmongo service and place the init‑mongo.js script in a Docker volume mounted at /docker-entrypoint‑initdb.d of the mongo service, which Mongo will execute automatically on first start. After updating the healthcheck (or using the built‑in init mechanism) restart the stack and all containers should start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack won’t start is that the “initmongo” helper never finishes because it’s trying to run a script against a container that isn’t yet reachable, and the compose file also contains an unnecessary extra Mongo instance. To fix it, drop the initmongo service entirely and instead mount the init‑mongo.js file directly into the mongo service under /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d so MongoDB will execute the seed data automatically when it first starts; also make the webapp service wait for the Mongo health‑check by adding condition: service_healthy under its depends_on entry. After those two changes the webapp will be able to connect to a healthy MongoDB instance and the containers will stay up.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines a Node.js webapp and a MongoDB container. No Drupal service is present, so the image does not use any of the listed vulnerable Drupal versions (code_hard_version is false). Additionally, the required services list ['drupal','mysql'] is not satisfied because the stack uses MongoDB instead of MySQL and no Drupal service at all (services_ok is false).
	- ERROR: The compose file defines a Node.js webapp and a MongoDB container. No Drupal service is present, so the image does not use any of the listed vulnerable Drupal versions (code_hard_version is false). Additionally, the required services list ['drupal','mysql'] is not satisfied because the stack uses MongoDB instead of MySQL and no Drupal service at all (services_ok is false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the required service list you must replace the MongoDB‑based Node application with a Drupal stack backed by MySQL. Change the compose file so that the webapp service builds the official Drupal image (or a custom Dockerfile that installs Drupal 7.64 or earlier), add a db service that uses mysql:5.7, map the Drupal files directory to a volume, and set the DRUPAL_DB_URL environment variable to point to the MySQL container. Remove the Mongo service and its healthcheck, update any init scripts to load the Drupal database schema instead of the Mongo seed data, and ensure the MySQL container exposes its port and uses a persistent volume. After these adjustments the stack will contain the hard‑coded Drupal service and a compatible MySQL version, making services_ok true.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Drupal service maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default HTTP port 80, so it is not accessible via the expected default network port. MySQL uses the default port 3306, but the overall setup fails the milestone because not all services use their default host ports.
	- ERROR: The Drupal service maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default HTTP port 80, so it is not accessible via the expected default network port. MySQL uses the default port 3306, but the overall setup fails the milestone because not all services use their default host ports.
	- FIX: To bring the Drupal container onto the default HTTP port, edit the docker‑compose.yml so the ports section for the drupal service reads "80:80" instead of "8080:80" (or simply remove the ports key so Docker publishes the container’s port 80 on the host’s port 80). Likewise, ensure any other services that need to be reachable on their standard ports are either left without explicit host‑port mappings (letting Docker use the same port) or have matching host‑port numbers, e.g., keep MySQL as "3306:3306" which already uses the default. After updating the port mapping, redeploy the stack so all services are exposed on their conventional host ports.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
