    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116341 is a stored and reflected cross\u2011site scripting vulnerability in the core File module of the Drupal content management system. The flaw allows an attacker to upload a file that is identified as an image (for example a crafted GIF) but actually contains arbitrary HTML or JavaScript. Drupal stores the file unchanged in the public files directory (`/sites/default/files/pictures/<YYYY\u2011MM>/`) and serves it with a MIME type that browsers interpret as HTML. When a victim (including an authenticated administrator) accesses the URL of the uploaded file, the embedded script executes in the context of the vulnerable site, enabling cookie theft, session hijacking, phishing, or further privilege escalation. The vulnerability is present in all Drupal 7 releases prior to 7.65 and in Drupal 8 releases prior to 8.5.14 and 8.6.13. It is mitigated by upgrading to Drupal 7.65, 8.5.14, 8.6.13, or any later version, and by tightening file\u2011type validation and MIME\u2011type checks on uploads.",
