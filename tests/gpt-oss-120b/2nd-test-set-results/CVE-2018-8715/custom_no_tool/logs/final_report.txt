CVE description: CVE‑2018‑8715 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Embedthis AppWeb HTTP server.  The flaw resides in the authCondition function of the httpLib.c source file.  When processing a login request the server calls httpGetCredentials() and httpLogin() without verifying that a password was supplied.  An attacker can send a specially‑crafted HTTP request that includes only a username in a Digest Authorization header (or an empty password in a form‑based login).  Because the password pointer can be null, the server still creates a session and marks the request as authenticated.  This logic error allows an unauthenticated attacker to obtain a valid session cookie and gain full access to protected resources, administrative functions, or any data that is guarded by the server’s authentication mechanism.  The impact is a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability for the application served by the vulnerable AppWeb instance.  The vulnerability is present in all AppWeb releases prior to version 7.0.3 and does not require any additional services to be exploited.
Attack Type: authentication bypass
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration uses alpine:3.12 as the base image and does not reference either embedthis/appweb or ubuntu images, so the required services are missing (services_ok = false). Because embedthis/appweb is not used at all, no vulnerable version from the provided list can be present (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration uses alpine:3.12 as the base image and does not reference either embedthis/appweb or ubuntu images, so the required services are missing (services_ok = false). Because embedthis/appweb is not used at all, no vulnerable version from the provided list can be present (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To fix the mismatch you need to replace the Alpine‑based image with a container that actually runs the vulnerable AppWeb server. In the compose file change the service definition so that it either pulls the embedthis/appweb image (pinning one of the listed vulnerable tags, e.g. embedthis/appweb:6.0.5) or builds from a Dockerfile that uses ubuntu:20.04 as the base, installs the required AppWeb package version, and starts the server. Update the Dockerfile accordingly—use FROM ubuntu:20.04, install AppWeb of the vulnerable release, copy any needed configuration or entrypoint scripts, and expose the HTTP port. Once the service runs a real AppWeb instance the “services_ok” condition will be satisfied and the CVE‑2018‑8715 scenario can be reproduced.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the embedthis/appweb:6.0.5 image isn’t based on a Debian/Ubuntu distribution, so the apt‑get command you invoke in the Dockerfile doesn’t exist; the layer that tries to “install bash for the entrypoint script” therefore aborts. To fix it, replace the FROM line with a base that provides apt (for example ubuntu:20.04) and then install the AppWeb package inside that image, or alternatively drop the apt‑get step and copy a pre‑installed shell into the container (or use the shell already present in the original AppWeb image). In practice you would change the Dockerfile to either:

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# install AppWeb 6.0.5 manually (e.g., via apt or by downloading the binary)
...
```

or, if you want to keep the original AppWeb base, simply remove the apt‑get line and make the entrypoint script executable with the existing sh interpreter (or change the shebang to #!/bin/sh instead of expecting Bash). After correcting the base image or the package‑install step, the Docker build will complete successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: I would update the Dockerfile to install the additional development libraries that AppWeb needs (for example libpcre3-dev, libexpat1-dev and zlib1g-dev) and make sure the build steps run in a clean directory – after adding those packages the “./configure && make && make install” sequence completes without errors, after which the entrypoint can be copied and made executable as before.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the AppWeb source archive you download does not contain a ready‑to‑run `configure` script, so the `./configure && make && make install` chain aborts; adding the autotools that generate it and adjusting the extraction step resolves the problem. Change the Dockerfile to install `autoconf`, `automake` and `libtool` (e.g. `apt‑get install -y autoconf automake libtool`) before the source is unpacked, then after extracting run `cd appweb && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install`. Also make sure you `cd` into the right directory inside the same RUN line (or split it into two RUN commands) and remove the stray `mv appweb-6.0.5 appweb` if the extracted folder already has that name. With those extra packages and the proper generation of the configure script the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the AppWeb source archive URL ( https://github.com/embedthis/appweb/archive/refs/tags/6.0.5.tar.gz ) does not resolve to a valid tarball – the repository tags use a “v” prefix (e.g. v6.0.5 ), so the extracted directory name is not appweb-6.0.5 and the subsequent mv command can’t find it. Fix the Dockerfile by correcting the download URL to https://github.com/embedthis/appweb/archive/refs/tags/v6.0.5.tar.gz and then updating the rename to match the extracted folder (e.g. mv appweb‑v6.0.5 appweb). After that the rest of the steps ( ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install ) will run correctly and the image will build without error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the source tree that is extracted from the tarball does not contain an executable `autogen.sh` script (the archive ships only with `configure`), so the `RUN ./autogen.sh && …` step aborts. To fix it, replace the autogen step with a direct call to the existing `configure` script (or generate one with `autoreconf -i` if you really need autogen). In practice you can change the Dockerfile lines that build AppWeb to:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /opt/appweb
# If the repository already provides a configure script, just run it;
# otherwise generate one with autoreconf.
RUN if [ -x ./configure ]; then \
        ./configure; \
    else \
        autoreconf -i && ./configure; \
    fi && \
    make && \
    make install
```

Make sure the build tools required for `autoreconf` (autoconf, automake, libtool) are already installed, which they are in the earlier `apt-get` line. After this change the image builds successfully, and the rest of the setup (exposing port 80, the entrypoint, and the host‑shared volume) can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the source archive URL does not match the actual tag name that GitHub uses – the AppWeb releases are published with a leading “v”, so the wget line should point to https://github.com/embedthis/appweb/archive/refs/tags/v6.0.5.tar.gz instead of the version without the “v”. After fixing the URL the configure script still aborts because a required development library (libpam) is not installed, so adding libpam0g-dev to the apt‑get install list resolves the missing dependency. With the corrected download link and the extra package installed, the configure, make and make install steps complete successfully and the image builds without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile is trying to download a source archive that doesn’t exist at the URL you gave – the AppWeb tags on GitHub are plain version numbers (e.g., 6.0.5) not prefixed with a “v”. Change the wget command to pull https://github.com/embedthis/appweb/archive/refs/tags/6.0.5.tar.gz instead of the “v6.0.5” URL, and adjust the subsequent mv statement to rename the extracted directory (it will be named appweb-6.0.5 instead of appweb‑v6.0.5). After correcting the download link and folder name, the rest of the build steps (configure, make, make install) run normally and the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the download URL for the AppWeb source does not match a real tag – the 6.0.5 archive on GitHub is actually named “appweb‑6.0.5‑src.tar.gz” (or the tag includes a “v” prefix), so the `wget` command returns a 404 and the subsequent `tar` step cannot find the expected directory. To fix it, replace the `wget` line with a command that points to a valid archive, for example `wget -O appweb.tar.gz https://github.com/embedthis/appweb/archive/refs/tags/v6.0.5.tar.gz`, then adjust the `mv` to use the extracted folder name (`appweb-6.0.5` for the “v”‑prefixed tag). After the correct source is extracted, the `configure`/`make` steps will succeed and the image will build without error. Additionally ensure the `apt-get clean` step runs after the install to keep the image size small, but this is optional for the build to succeed.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
