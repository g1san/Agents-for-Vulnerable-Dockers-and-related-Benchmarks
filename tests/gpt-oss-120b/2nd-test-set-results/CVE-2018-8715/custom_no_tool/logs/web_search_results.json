    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20118715 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Embedthis AppWeb HTTP server.  The flaw resides in the authCondition function of the httpLib.c source file.  When processing a login request the server calls httpGetCredentials() and httpLogin() without verifying that a password was supplied.  An attacker can send a specially\u2011crafted HTTP request that includes only a username in a Digest Authorization header (or an empty password in a form\u2011based login).  Because the password pointer can be null, the server still creates a session and marks the request as authenticated.  This logic error allows an unauthenticated attacker to obtain a valid session cookie and gain full access to protected resources, administrative functions, or any data that is guarded by the server\u2019s authentication mechanism.  The impact is a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability for the application served by the vulnerable AppWeb instance.  The vulnerability is present in all AppWeb releases prior to version 7.0.3 and does not require any additional services to be exploited.",
