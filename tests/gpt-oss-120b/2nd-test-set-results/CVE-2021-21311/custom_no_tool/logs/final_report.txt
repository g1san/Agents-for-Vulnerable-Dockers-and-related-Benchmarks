CVE description: CVE‑2021‑21311 is a Server‑Side Request Forgery vulnerability that affects Adminer, the single‑file PHP database management tool. The flaw exists in the way Adminer processes the connection parameters supplied through its web interface. An attacker can control the `server` field (for example by submitting a crafted POST request) and cause Adminer to perform an arbitrary HTTP request to any URL reachable from the host. The response from the requested URL is reflected in the error page, allowing the attacker to read internal resources such as cloud metadata services, internal APIs, or other sensitive endpoints. The vulnerability is present in all Adminer releases from version 4.0.0 through version 4.7.8 inclusive and was fixed in version 4.7.9. Successful exploitation can lead to leakage of internal data, credential disclosure, and further compromise of the surrounding environment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem stems from the fact that the Python‑based vulnerable‑app image does not contain a Docker client, so the call to docker run fails silently and prevents the container from starting correctly. To fix it, modify the Dockerfile to install the Docker CLI (for example by adding apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y docker.io or by copying the Docker binary from the official docker image) before the CMD instruction, and keep the ENV variable DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375 so the client talks to the daemon exposed on port 2375. After rebuilding the image, the app.py script will be able to invoke docker run successfully when the /exploit endpoint is hit.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The “vulnerable‑app” service cannot reach the Docker daemon because the two containers are on different default networks and the Docker client binary is not installed correctly. Add a shared network (or just rely on the default network) and install the Docker CLI instead of the whole docker.io package, then point DOCKER_HOST at the service name “docker”. In the Dockerfile replace the apt line with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-cli && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, and in docker‑compose add a `networks: default:` block (or simply omit any custom network so both services share the default one). Finally, ensure the environment variable is set inside the container (it already is) and optionally add a small sleep or retry loop in app.py so the app starts after the Docker daemon is ready. With these changes the “vulnerable‑app” container will be able to connect to the Docker daemon on tcp://docker:2375 and start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines only two services: 'docker' (using the image docker:20.10.5-dind) and 'vulnerable-app' (built from a Python Flask Dockerfile). No service named 'adminer' is present, so none of the listed vulnerable adminer versions are used. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. Additionally, the required services ['adminer', 'php'] are absent from the configuration, so the 'services_ok' milestone is also not met.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines only two services: 'docker' (using the image docker:20.10.5-dind) and 'vulnerable-app' (built from a Python Flask Dockerfile).

Additionally, the required services ['adminer', 'php'] are absent from the configuration, so the 'services_ok' milestone is also not met.
	- FIX: To satisfy the missing adminer and php requirements you should add two new services to the compose file: one that runs the official PHP‑Apache image (e.g., php:8.2-apache) and another that runs an Adminer container built from a Dockerfile that copies the vulnerable adminer‑4.7.8.php script into /var/www/html so it is served by the PHP service. Then update the vulnerable‑app service to depend on both the php and adminer services (or expose the Adminer endpoint through the PHP container) and configure its DOCKER_HOST environment variable as before. Finally, ensure the Adminer image uses the exact vulnerable version (4.7.8) and that the PHP container is reachable on the expected port, which will meet the code_hard_version and services_ok milestones.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file does not expose all services on their typical default ports. The PHP/Apache container runs on internal port 80 but is published to host port 8081, deviating from the standard host port 80. The vulnerable-app runs Flask on port 8080, which is not Flask's default (5000) and is exposed as 8080:8080, indicating a custom port choice. The Adminer container does not publish any port at all, relying on a shared volume with the PHP container, so it is not directly accessible via its usual port (generally 8080). Consequently, the setup does not meet the "default network ports" requirement.

Consequently, the setup does not meet the "default network ports" requirement.
	- FIX: To make the stack use its usual ports, change the php service to map the standard HTTP port (80:80) instead of 8081, adjust the vulnerable‑app service to expose Flask on its default port (5000:5000) and update the Flask app to listen on 5000, and add a ports line to the adminer service so it publishes the typical Adminer port (e.g., 8080:80). After those three port mappings are updated, the containers will be reachable on their conventional host ports and the “default network ports” requirement will be satisfied.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Adminer service is mapped to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which does not match its default HTTP port 80. All other services use their default ports, but this deviation means the network setup milestone is not fully satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Adminer service is mapped to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which does not match its default HTTP port 80. All other services use their default ports, but this deviation means the network setup milestone is not fully satisfied.
	- FIX: To align the Adminer container with its default HTTP port, change its ports line in docker‑compose.yml from "8080:80" to "80:80". After updating the compose file, restart the stack so Adminer is reachable on the host’s standard port 80 just like the other services, eliminating the port‑mapping inconsistency. Ensure any external scripts or tests that previously pointed to localhost:8080 are updated to use localhost:80 as well.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build itself is fine – the failure comes from the compose file, where both the **php** service and the **adminer** service try to bind the container’s port 80 to the host’s port 80 at the same time. When Docker brings the stack up the second bind attempt hits “port already in use” and aborts the whole deployment. To fix it, change the adminer service’s port mapping to an unused host port (for example `"8080:80"`), or remove the host‑port bind completely if you only need to reach it through the internal network. After that adjustment the images will build and the stack will start normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The php service is mapped to host port 8081 ("8081:80"), which deviates from its default HTTP port 80. Since not all services expose their default network ports, the network_setup milestone is not achieved.
	- ERROR: The php service is mapped to host port 8081 ("8081:80"), which deviates from its default HTTP port 80. Since not all services expose their default network ports, the network_setup milestone is not achieved.
	- FIX: Change the php service so it publishes its container port 80 on the host’s standard HTTP port 80 instead of 8081; in the docker‑compose file replace the line `- "8081:80"` with `- "80:80"`. This makes the php service reachable on its default port, allowing the environment to meet the network‑setup requirement without needing any additional port redirections.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Adminer service does not have a host port binding; it is only reachable internally via the Docker network. Therefore it is not accessible on its default HTTP port (80) from the outside, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The Adminer service does not have a host port binding; it is only reachable internally via the Docker network. Therefore it is not accessible on its default HTTP port (80) from the outside, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Add a host‑port mapping to the **adminer** service so that its Apache listener is reachable from outside the Docker network—e.g., under the service definition insert `ports: ["8080:80"]` (or any unused host port). Because the adminer container already mounts the same `adminer_www` volume as the php container, exposing its own port is the simplest way to make the vulnerable Adminer UI accessible to the test harness and let the `network_setup` milestone succeed. After adding the port mapping, redeploy the stack; the adminer UI will be reachable at `http://localhost:8080` (or the chosen host port).
