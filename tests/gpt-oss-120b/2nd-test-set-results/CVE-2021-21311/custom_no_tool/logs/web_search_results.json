    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201121311 is a Server\u2011Side Request Forgery vulnerability that affects Adminer, the single\u2011file PHP database management tool. The flaw exists in the way Adminer processes the connection parameters supplied through its web interface. An attacker can control the `server` field (for example by submitting a crafted POST request) and cause Adminer to perform an arbitrary HTTP request to any URL reachable from the host. The response from the requested URL is reflected in the error page, allowing the attacker to read internal resources such as cloud metadata services, internal APIs, or other sensitive endpoints. The vulnerability is present in all Adminer releases from version 4.0.0 through version 4.7.8 inclusive and was fixed in version 4.7.9. Successful exploitation can lead to leakage of internal data, credential disclosure, and further compromise of the surrounding environment.",
