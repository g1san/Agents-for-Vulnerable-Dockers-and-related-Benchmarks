CVE description: CVE‑2022‑41678 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ caused by an unsafe exposure of the Jolokia HTTP‑JMX bridge (org.holokia.http.AgentServlet) at the path /api/jolokia. When an attacker authenticates to the ActiveMQ web console (default credentials admin:admin) they can send crafted JSON requests to the Jolokia endpoint. The request is processed by ExecHandler, which allows invocation of arbitrary JMX operations. By targeting vulnerable MBeans—particularly the Java Flight Recorder MBean (jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl) and Log4j appender MBeans—an attacker can write arbitrary files (e.g., a JSP web‑shell) to the filesystem and subsequently execute them, achieving full remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability does not rely on Java deserialization and can be exploited over the network with low complexity.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is most likely caused by the `docker‑compose.yml` pointing to a non‑existent Dockerfile path – the `web` service uses `build: ./web` while the compose file lives in `custom_no_tool`, so Docker looks for `custom_no_tool/web/Dockerfile` (which exists) but then copies the whole context (`custom_no_tool/web`) and cannot find the `package-lock.json` because it’s actually one directory up. To fix it, move the `Dockerfile` (and the `package*.json` files) into a dedicated build context folder (e.g., create a `custom_no_tool/web/build` directory) and change the compose entry to `build: ./web/build`. Then adjust the `COPY` lines in the Dockerfile to reference the files relative to that new context (e.g., `COPY package*.json ./`). This guarantees that all needed files are present when the image is built and eliminates the “file not found” error. Additionally, adding a simple healthcheck for MySQL and delaying the application start until the database is ready will prevent runtime connection errors, but the immediate build issue is solved by aligning the build context with the actual location of the source files.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to run `npm install --only=production --legacy-peer-deps` on an Alpine base that lacks the build tools required for some of the transitive dependencies, and the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag can cause npm to resolve to a broken dependency tree. The quickest fix is to replace the install line with a clean, Alpine‑friendly command such as `npm ci --only=production` (which uses the lockfile and does not need extra tooling), add `RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++` before the install if any native modules are still required, and set `ENV NODE_ENV=production` so that only production packages are pulled. After these changes the image should build without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Node 14 image doesn’t include the compilation tools that some of the npm packages (e.g., transitive dependencies of express) need when `npm ci` runs, so the install step aborts. Fix it by extending the Dockerfile to add the required build utilities before the `npm ci` step (for example, `apk add --no‑cache make gcc g++ python3`) or by switching the base image to a non‑Alpine variant such as `node:14‑buster` which already ships with the needed toolchain. After installing the build tools (or changing the base image) the `npm ci --only=production` step will complete and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Node image 14‑buster no longer includes the `python3` package name expected by the Dockerfile, and the `apt-get update && apt-get install … && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` line may be leaving the package list in a stale state. Replace the install line with `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential python3-minimal && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` so the required tools are installed and the cache cleared. Also ensure the working directory and copy commands are correct; moving the `COPY . .` after `npm ci` is fine, but verify that `package-lock.json` exists in the source folder. After these adjustments the Docker image should build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile pulls in unnecessary native‑build prerequisites that aren’t needed for the pure‑JavaScript dependencies you use, and on some hosts the `apt‑get` step can error out (for example when the base image does not include the expected package lists). Simplify the Dockerfile by removing the `apt‑get update && apt‑get install …` line, keep only the `WORKDIR`, copy the lockfile, run `npm ci --only=production`, copy the source, expose the port, and start the app; this eliminates the failing package installation and still produces a functional image.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Node image can’t install the dependencies – the bundled package‑lock.json contains placeholder integrity fields (the “sha512‑…” entries) that make npm reject the install. The quickest fix is to stop using that lock file when the image is built: delete package‑lock.json or add a line in the Dockerfile to ignore it (for example, copy only package.json and then run npm install without the --production flag if you need dev dependencies, or simply drop --production if you want all modules). After removing the broken lock file (or replacing it with a valid one generated on a working machine), the npm install step will succeed and the image will build correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration only includes a Node.js web service (built from node:14-bullseye) and a MySQL 5.7 database. Neither the image nor the compose file references the apache/activemq service, so no vulnerable activemq version from the listed set is used (code_hard_version = false). Additionally, the required services list ['apache/activemq', 'docker'] is not satisfied because apache/activemq is absent and there is no service named 'docker' in the compose definition; only 'web' and 'db' are present (services_ok = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration only includes a Node.js web service (built from node:14-bullseye) and a MySQL 5.7 database. Neither the image nor the compose file references the apache/activemq service, so no vulnerable activemq version from the listed set is used (code_hard_version = false). Additionally, the required services list ['apache/activemq', 'docker'] is not satisfied because apache/activemq is absent and there is no service named 'docker' in the compose definition; only 'web' and 'db' are present (services_ok = false).
	- FIX: Add a proper apache/activemq service to the compose file – for example, declare a activemq service that uses an image such as rmohr/activemq:5.16.0 (or any of the listed vulnerable versions), expose the required ports (usually 61616 for TCP and 8161 for the web console) and set any needed environment variables for the broker. This brings the missing hard‑dependency into the stack, satisfies the required‑service list and makes the CVE‑2022‑41678 scenario applicable. Once the Activemq container is running, you can point any client code that needs to talk to the broker to the activemq service name instead of the previous placeholder, completing the fix in just a few lines of YAML.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the health‑check defined for the **activemq** service uses `curl`, but the `rmohr/activemq:5.16.0` image does not contain the curl binary, so the test command cannot be executed and Docker aborts the compose start‑up. The fix is to make the health‑check command available inside the container – either by swapping it for a tool that already exists (for example `wget` or `nc`) or, more reliably, by extending the activemq image and installing curl. You can create a small Dockerfile such as:

```
FROM rmohr/activemq:5.16.0
RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

and then reference this Dockerfile in the compose file (replace `image: rmohr/activemq:5.16.0` with `build: ./activemq`). After rebuilding the stack the health‑check will succeed and the container will start normally. No other changes to the Node‑JS web app or the MySQL service are required for the build to complete.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the web image is trying to install its Node dependencies without the lock file, which can cause version mismatches or missing transitive packages, and the activemq image’s health‑check runs before the curl binary is available. To fix it, edit the web/Dockerfile so that it copies package-lock.json alongside package.json (e.g. COPY package*.json ./ ) and then runs npm ci instead of npm install to install the exact locked versions; this guarantees a reproducible install and avoids npm errors. In the activemq/Dockerfile make sure the curl package is installed before the container’s health‑check is evaluated (the current RUN line already does that, but keeping it at the end of the Dockerfile ensures the binary is present when the health‑check runs). After these two small changes the images should build without terminating.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
