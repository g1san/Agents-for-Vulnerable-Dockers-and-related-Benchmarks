    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201141678 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ caused by an unsafe exposure of the Jolokia HTTP\u2011JMX bridge (org.holokia.http.AgentServlet) at the path /api/jolokia. When an attacker authenticates to the ActiveMQ web console (default credentials admin:admin) they can send crafted JSON requests to the Jolokia endpoint. The request is processed by ExecHandler, which allows invocation of arbitrary JMX operations. By targeting vulnerable MBeans\u2014particularly the Java Flight Recorder MBean (jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl) and Log4j appender MBeans\u2014an attacker can write arbitrary files (e.g., a JSP web\u2011shell) to the filesystem and subsequently execute them, achieving full remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability does not rely on Java deserialization and can be exploited over the network with low complexity.",
