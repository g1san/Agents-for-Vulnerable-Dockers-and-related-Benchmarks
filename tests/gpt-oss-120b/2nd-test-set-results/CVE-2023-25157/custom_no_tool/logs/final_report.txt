CVE description: CVE‑2023‑25157 is a severe SQL injection vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the OGC filter handling code (CQL_FILTER parameter) which forwards user‑supplied filter expressions directly to the GeoTools library. GeoTools then concatenates those expressions into the SQL statement sent to the underlying relational datastore without proper escaping or the use of prepared statements. When GeoServer is configured with a JDBC datastore (e.g., PostGIS, Oracle, or any other JDBC‑compatible database) an attacker can craft a malicious CQL_FILTER value (such as in a WFS GetFeature request) that injects arbitrary SQL. The injected SQL is executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data and, depending on database privileges, potentially achieve full system compromise. The vulnerability affects GeoServer versions prior to 2.21.4 and the 2.22.x series before 2.22.2, and it is linked to vulnerable GeoTools library versions (< 28.2, < 27.4, < 26.7, < 25.7, < 24.7). The CVSS score is 9.8, reflecting high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][geoserver][['2.18.7', '2.19.7', '2.20.7', '2.21.0', '2.21.1', '2.21.2', '2.21.3', '2.22.0', '2.22.1']] GeoServer version that contains the vulnerable OGC filter parsing code; required to demonstrate the CVE.
- [SOFT-DB][postgis/postgis][['13-3.3']] Relational database with PostGIS extension used as the backend datastore for GeoServer; needed for GeoServer to execute SQL queries.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.25.3-alpine']] Web server acting as a reverse proxy in front of GeoServer to provide typical Docker‑compose networking; not required for the vulnerability itself but useful for a realistic deployment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines only two services: 'web' (based on php:7.4-apache) and 'db' (based on mysql:5.7). Neither geoserver, postgis/postgis nor nginx are present, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, the only potential 'HARD' service listed for version checking is geoserver, which is not used at all; therefore the required versions (2.18.7‑2.22.1) are not employed, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines only two services: 'web' (based on php:7.4-apache) and 'db' (based on mysql:5.7). Neither geoserver, postgis/postgis nor nginx are present, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, the only potential 'HARD' service listed for version checking is geoserver, which is not used at all; therefore the required versions (2.18.7‑2.22.1) are not employed, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the “services_ok” milestone you would add a GeoServer container to the compose file, using an image that runs the vulnerable version (for example geoserver:2.21.3) and configure it to connect to a PostGIS‐enabled database; you can replace the MySQL service with a postgis/postgis:13-3.3 image (or add it alongside MySQL if you prefer to keep both databases). In the web service you would adjust the environment variables so DB_HOST points to the PostGIS container and update the PHP code to use the PostgreSQL driver (or keep the MySQL example for a parallel test). Finally, ensure the GeoServer service is built or pulled with the exact version range required (2.18.7 through 2.22.1) so the “code_hard_version” check passes. This brings the composition in line with the declared HARD service and the required version constraints.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because Docker can’t locate the `geoserver:2.21.3` image you reference – the official GeoServer images are published under the `geoserver/geoserver` repository, not as a bare name. Change the service definition to pull the correct tag, e.g.:

```yaml
geoserver:
  image: geoserver/geoserver:2.21.3
  ports:
    - "8081:8080"
  depends_on:
    - db
  environment:
    - SKIP_DEMO_DATA=true
```

While you’re here, tidy up the PHP‑Apache image so the build doesn’t run out of space or leave dangling apt caches. After installing `libpq-dev` and the PostgreSQL extensions, clean the package list:

```dockerfile
FROM php:7.4-apache
COPY index.php /var/www/html/
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libpq-dev && \
    docker-php-ext-install pgsql pdo_pgsql && \
    docker-php-ext-enable pgsql pdo_pgsql && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

These two small changes (pointing to the proper GeoServer image and cleaning up apt in the PHP image) resolve the build‑time failure and let the stack start successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑PostgreSQL extensions are being compiled before the required development libraries are present, so the docker‑php‑ext‑install step cannot find libpq headers. Fix it by updating the web/Dockerfile to install the PostgreSQL client development package (libpq‑dev) before invoking docker‑php‑ext‑install, and combine the two extension builds in a single command (e.g. docker‑php‑ext‑install pgsql pdo_pgsql). After adding the apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y libpq-dev line (and cleaning up the apt cache) the image will compile successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP image doesn’t have the compilation tools needed to compile the pgsql and pdo_pgsql extensions, so the docker‑php‑ext‑install step aborts. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to install the build‑essential packages (e.g., build-essential or gcc make autoconf pkg‑config) before running apt‑get update and adding libpq-dev, then keep the docker‑php‑ext‑install and docker‑php‑ext‑enable commands as they are; after that the image will compile the PostgreSQL extensions successfully and the build will complete.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP‑Apache image does not have the PostgreSQL client libraries needed for the pgsql and pdo_pgsql extensions, and the Dockerfile tries to install them after the extension build step; the apt‑get line also leaves the package index in a state that prevents the later install commands from finding the required headers. To fix it, move the installation of the build tools and libpq‑dev package to the same RUN instruction that performs the extension compilation, then clean up the apt cache in the same layer, for example by replacing the Dockerfile’s two‑step RUN with a single command that updates the package lists, installs build‑essential and libpq‑dev, runs `docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) pgsql pdo_pgsql`, enables the extensions, and finally removes the apt cache. Also ensure that the `COPY index.php /var/www/html/` line points to a file that actually exists in the build context (the `web` directory). After these adjustments the image builds correctly and the container can start.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image can’t compile the PostgreSQL extensions – the required development headers aren’t present. To fix it, adjust the Dockerfile so that the `libpq-dev` package (and its build tools) are installed before invoking `docker-php-ext-install`, and then clean up the apt cache after the extensions are compiled. In practice you would replace the current RUN line with something like:  

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential libpq-dev && \
    docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) pgsql pdo_pgsql && \
    docker-php-ext-enable pgsql pdo_pgsql && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```  

This ensures the PostgreSQL client libraries are available when the extensions are built, allowing the image to compile successfully. Afterwards the services can start normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP extensions are being compiled before the required development headers are fully available, so I would modify the web Dockerfile to first install the build tools and libpq‑dev packages, clean the apt cache, and then run the php‑ext‑install commands in a single layer – for example, update the Dockerfile to run “apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential libpq-dev && docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) pgsql pdo_pgsql && docker-php-ext-enable pgsql pdo_pgsql && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*”. Adding the “ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive” line before the apt commands also prevents interactive prompts that abort the build. After these changes the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php:7.4‑apache image is no longer maintained in the official registry, so the compiler can’t find the matching libraries for the pgsql extensions; swapping the base to a current, supported variant (for example php:8.2‑apache or php:8.1‑apache) resolves the problem and the rest of the Dockerfile can stay the same, letting docker‑php‑ext‑install compile pgsql/pdo_pgsql against the libpq‑dev packages that are installed. After changing the FROM line to a valid tag, rerun docker‑compose and the web image will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image tries to compile the PostgreSQL extensions before the system’s build tools and libraries are fully prepared – the `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` argument isn’t actually exported as an environment variable and the required `postgresql-client` package (which provides `pg_config` needed by `docker-php-ext-install`) is missing. Fix it by turning the ARG into an ENV (or adding a separate ENV line) so the apt commands run non‑interactively, installing `postgresql-client` together with `libpq-dev`, and then running the extension install; the final Dockerfile would start with `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and use a RUN line like `apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential libpq-dev postgresql-client && docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) pgsql pdo_pgsql && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. After this change the web image builds successfully and the compose stack can start.
