{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201125157 is a severe SQL injection vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the OGC filter handling code (CQL_FILTER parameter) which forwards user\u2011supplied filter expressions directly to the GeoTools library. GeoTools then concatenates those expressions into the SQL statement sent to the underlying relational datastore without proper escaping or the use of prepared statements. When GeoServer is configured with a JDBC datastore (e.g., PostGIS, Oracle, or any other JDBC\u2011compatible database) an attacker can craft a malicious CQL_FILTER value (such as in a WFS GetFeature request) that injects arbitrary SQL. The injected SQL is executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data and, depending on database privileges, potentially achieve full system compromise. The vulnerability affects GeoServer versions prior to 2.21.4 and the 2.22.x series before 2.22.2, and it is linked to vulnerable GeoTools library versions (<\u202f28.2,\u202f<\u202f27.4,\u202f<\u202f26.7,\u202f<\u202f25.7,\u202f<\u202f24.7). The CVSS score is 9.8, reflecting high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.",
