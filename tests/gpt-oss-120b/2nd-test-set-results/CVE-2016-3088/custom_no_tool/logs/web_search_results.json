    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20113088 is a severe vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x that resides in the Fileserver web application bundled with the broker. The Fileserver servlet, provided by the embedded Jetty server, accepts unauthenticated HTTP\u202fPUT requests to upload arbitrary files to a configurable directory and then allows an HTTP\u202fMOVE operation that can relocate the uploaded file to any location on the server's file system without any path validation. An attacker can therefore upload a malicious JSP, servlet, or script and move it into a directory that is served or executed by Jetty (for example, the admin web\u2011application directory). Once placed, the payload is executed with the same privileges as the ActiveMQ process, resulting in unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability affects every ActiveMQ release from the initial 5.0 series up to, but not including, version 5.14.0. No authentication, special privileges, or additional services are required to exploit the flaw; only network access to the ActiveMQ HTTP console (default port 8161) is needed. Successful exploitation gives an attacker full control over the host running ActiveMQ and the ability to pivot to other systems on the network.",
