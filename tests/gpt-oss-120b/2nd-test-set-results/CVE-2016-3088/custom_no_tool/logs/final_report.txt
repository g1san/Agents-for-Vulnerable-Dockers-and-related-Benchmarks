CVE description: CVE‑2016‑3088 is a severe vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x that resides in the Fileserver web application bundled with the broker. The Fileserver servlet, provided by the embedded Jetty server, accepts unauthenticated HTTP PUT requests to upload arbitrary files to a configurable directory and then allows an HTTP MOVE operation that can relocate the uploaded file to any location on the server's file system without any path validation. An attacker can therefore upload a malicious JSP, servlet, or script and move it into a directory that is served or executed by Jetty (for example, the admin web‑application directory). Once placed, the payload is executed with the same privileges as the ActiveMQ process, resulting in unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability affects every ActiveMQ release from the initial 5.0 series up to, but not including, version 5.14.0. No authentication, special privileges, or additional services are required to exploit the flaw; only network access to the ActiveMQ HTTP console (default port 8161) is needed. Successful exploitation gives an attacker full control over the host running ActiveMQ and the ability to pivot to other systems on the network.
Attack Type: Remote Code Execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apacheactivemq/activemq][['5.0.0', '5.0.1', '5.1.0', '5.2.0', '5.3.0', '5.4.0', '5.5.0', '5.6.0', '5.7.0', '5.8.0', '5.9.0', '5.10.0', '5.11.0', '5.12.0', '5.13.0', '5.13.1', '5.13.2']] Core Apache ActiveMQ broker image that includes the vulnerable Fileserver servlet; required to reproduce the CVE‑2016‑3088 remote code execution flaw.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker Compose defines a service "registry" using the image "registry:2", which is not the required "apacheactivemq/activemq" service. Consequently, the services_ok milestone is not met. Since no apacheactivemq image is used, no vulnerable version from the listed versions is present, so code_hard_version is false (no vulnerable version used).
	- ERROR: The Docker Compose defines a service "registry" using the image "registry:2", which is not the required "apacheactivemq/activemq" service. Consequently, the services_ok milestone is not met. Since no apacheactivemq image is used, no vulnerable version from the listed versions is present, so code_hard_version is false (no vulnerable version used).
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestone you need to replace the current “registry” service with an Apache ActiveMQ service that uses a vulnerable image from the listed releases. Change the service name (or keep it as registry) and set its image to apacheactivemq/activemq:5.13.2 (or any version between 5.0.0 and 5.13.2). Update the port mapping to expose the ActiveMQ console (for example 8161:8161) and remove the registry‑specific environment variables and volume definitions that are no longer needed. The resulting compose file should define a single service running the vulnerable ActiveMQ container on the correct port, thereby meeting the services_ok and code_hard_version conditions.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to start an ActiveMQ container but it never builds because the compose definition is incomplete – the registry service that the compose file expects isn’t declared and the registry configuration file points at a filesystem root that doesn’t exist inside any container. The quickest way to get the stack running is to add a minimal Registry service definition and bind‑mount the config file and a persistent storage directory, then make sure the ActiveMQ container can reach the registry (if it needs to pull images from it). In practice you would edit *docker‑compose.yml* to insert a `registry:` service section that uses the official `registry:2` image, sets `ports: - "5000:5000"`, mounts `./registry/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml` and mounts a host directory such as `./registry/data:/var/lib/registry`. Also add a `depends_on: - registry` line under the `activemq` service so Docker knows to start the registry first. Finally, create the host directories (`registry/data` and `registry`) before running `docker compose up`. This resolves the build‑time failure by supplying the missing registry definition and ensuring all referenced paths exist.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim JDK image does not include the tar utility needed to unpack the ActiveMQ archive, so the `curl … | tar -xz …` step aborts. Add tar to the list of packages installed in the same `apt‑get` command (for example `apt‑get install -y curl tar`) and extract the file after downloading it to a temporary location (download with `curl -fSL -o /tmp/activemq.tgz …` then run `tar -xzf /tmp/activemq.tgz -C $ACTIVEMQ_HOME --strip-components=1` and finally remove the temporary file). This ensures the archive is correctly unpacked and the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim OpenJDK image does not contain the CA certificates needed for HTTPS downloads, so the `curl` request to the Apache archive is rejected and the tar extraction never runs. Add the `ca-certificates` package (and optionally clean up the apt cache) to the install line, e.g. change the `RUN` instruction to install `ca-certificates` together with `curl` and `tar`, then the download succeeds and the image can be unpacked; after that the rest of the Dockerfile works unchanged.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ActiveMQ archive is being untarred into a non‑existent directory – the `$ACTIVEMQ_HOME` variable is expanded only after the `mkdir -p $ACTIVEMQ_HOME` line runs, but the shell used in the `RUN` command doesn’t inherit the earlier `ENV` definition when it’s executed in a single `&&` chain. To fix this, split the commands into separate `RUN` steps (or use an explicit `WORKDIR /opt/activemq` before extracting) so the directory exists when the tar operation runs; for example, add a `WORKDIR $ACTIVEMQ_HOME` line right after creating the folder and then extract the archive there. Additionally, ensure the `curl` command runs after `ca‑certificates` is installed (or combine the install of `curl` and `ca‑certificates` in the same `apt‑get install` line) so TLS verification doesn’t abort the download. After making these adjustments the image should build without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Activemq container only publishes port 8161 (HostPort 8161) while its default TCP broker port 61616 is not bound to any host port. Consequently, the service is not accessible on its expected default network port, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The Activemq container only publishes port 8161 (HostPort 8161) while its default TCP broker port 61616 is not bound to any host port. Consequently, the service is not accessible on its expected default network port, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Add a port mapping for the broker’s TCP listener in the compose file so the container’s 61616 port is reachable from the host; for example, under the activemq service replace the existing ports section with ‑ "8161:8161" and ‑ "61616:61616". This publishes the broker port on the host, allowing clients and the network‑setup test to connect to the expected default port while still exposing the web console on 8161. No other changes are required.
