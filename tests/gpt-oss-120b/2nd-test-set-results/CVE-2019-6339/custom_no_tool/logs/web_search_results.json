    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116339 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core that stems from improper handling of the PHP \\\"phar\\\" stream wrapper. When a Drupal site (versions 7.x earlier than 7.62, 8.5.x earlier than 8.5.9, or 8.6.x earlier than 8.6.6) processes a user\u2011supplied path that contains a `phar://` URL, the PHP interpreter will deserialize data from the PHAR archive. An attacker can upload a malicious image or file, then set the Drupal temporary\u2011file directory (or other configurable path) to a `phar://` URI that points to the uploaded file. When Drupal saves the configuration, it follows the `phar://` stream, parses the archive and executes the attacker\u2011controlled PHP code. The code runs with the privileges of the web\u2011server user, giving the attacker full control over the host \u2013 the ability to run arbitrary commands, install back\u2011doors, read or modify any data the web server can access, and move laterally within the network. The flaw is triggered via a normal HTTP POST request to the Drupal administration interface (for example `/admin/config/media/file-system`). No special privileges are required other than the ability to reach the vulnerable endpoint and, in many exploit paths, to perform an administrative action such as changing configuration or uploading a file. The vulnerability was fixed in Drupal 7.62, 8.5.9, and 8.6.6.",
