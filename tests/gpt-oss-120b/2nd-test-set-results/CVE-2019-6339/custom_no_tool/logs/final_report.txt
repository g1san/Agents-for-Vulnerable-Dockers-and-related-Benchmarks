----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2019‑6339 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core that stems from improper handling of the PHP \"phar\" stream wrapper. When a Drupal site (versions 7.x earlier than 7.62, 8.5.x earlier than 8.5.9, or 8.6.x earlier than 8.6.6) processes a user‑supplied path that contains a `phar://` URL, the PHP interpreter will deserialize data from the PHAR archive. An attacker can upload a malicious image or file, then set the Drupal temporary‑file directory (or other configurable path) to a `phar://` URI that points to the uploaded file. When Drupal saves the configuration, it follows the `phar://` stream, parses the archive and executes the attacker‑controlled PHP code. The code runs with the privileges of the web‑server user, giving the attacker full control over the host – the ability to run arbitrary commands, install back‑doors, read or modify any data the web server can access, and move laterally within the network. The flaw is triggered via a normal HTTP POST request to the Drupal administration interface (for example `/admin/config/media/file-system`). No special privileges are required other than the ability to reach the vulnerable endpoint and, in many exploit paths, to perform an administrative action such as changing configuration or uploading a file. The vulnerability was fixed in Drupal 7.62, 8.5.9, and 8.6.6.

- [SOFT-DB][mariadb][['10.5']] Relational database required by Drupal to store site data. This service is needed only for the Docker environment to run a functional Drupal site.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition only defines a single 'web' service based on nginx. Neither 'drupal' nor 'mariadb' services are present, so the required services list is not satisfied. Consequently, there is no Drupal version in use to check against the vulnerable version list, resulting in a failure for both the 'services_ok' and 'code_hard_version' milestones.

Consequently, there is no Drupal version in use to check against the vulnerable version list, resulting in a failure for both the 'services_ok' and 'code_hard_version' milestones.
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch you should extend the compose file so it provisions a Drupal container that runs a vulnerable core version (for example 7.61 or 8.6.5) and a MariaDB container for its database, then connect the Nginx “web” service to Drupal as a reverse proxy. Add a “drupal” service that builds from the official Drupal image with the appropriate tag, set its environment variables (e.g., DRUPAL_DB_HOST=mariadb, DRUPAL_DB_NAME, DRUPAL_DB_USER, DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD) and mount the Drupal code into /var/www/html, and add a “mariadb” service using the 10.5 image with a persistent volume for data. Update the Nginx configuration to forward PHP requests to the Drupal container (e.g., using fastcgi_pass to the Drupal service) and remove the unrelated large_client_header_buffers directive unless needed for testing. With these three services defined and correctly linked, the stack satisfies the required service list and the version checks will succeed.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The web service exposes port 80 inside the container but maps it to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default HTTP port (80). This means the service is not accessible on its standard network port. The drupal and mariadb services do not publish any ports to the host, so they are not reachable on their default ports either. Consequently, the configuration does not meet the requirement that all services be set up on their default network ports.

This means the service is not accessible on its standard network port. The drupal and mariadb services do not publish any ports to the host, so they are not reachable on their default ports either. Consequently, the configuration does not meet the requirement that all services be set up on their default network ports.
	- FIX: To make each service listen on its standard port, edit the docker‑compose file so the web container maps the container’s port 80 to the host’s port 80 instead of 8080, and add explicit port mappings for the Drupal PHP‑FPM process and the MariaDB database – for example, expose drupal’s internal port 9000 as host port 9000 (or map it to 80 if you intend to serve PHP directly) and expose mariadb’s internal port 3306 as host port 3306. Updating the “ports” sections for web, drupal, and mariadb to use their default numbers will ensure the services are reachable on their conventional network ports.
