CVE description: CVE-2018-19475 is a sandbox‑bypass vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter. A crafted PostScript document can cause Ghostscript to execute a %pipe% operator even when it is started with the -dSAFER option. The vulnerability resides in the restore handling code (psi/zdevice2.c) of Ghostscript versions prior to 9.26, allowing an attacker to overflow the operand stack, abort restoration of safety flags, and then set the OutputFile parameter to "%pipe%<command>". This results in arbitrary operating‑system command execution with the privileges of the Ghostscript process, leading to full system compromise.
Attack Type: remote command execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php‑5.6‑apache image does not have the libraries required to compile the mysqli extension, so the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` step aborts. Edit the Dockerfile in `custom_no_tool/web` to first update the package index and install the MySQL client development headers (and any other build tools) before invoking the extension installer, for example by adding a line such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && docker-php-ext-enable mysqli`. After installing those dependencies the image should compile successfully and the compose file will bring up the stack.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To fix the build failure, adjust the web/Dockerfile so that it either installs the missing compilation tools before trying to build the mysqli extension or drops the unnecessary build step because the php:5.6‑apache image already includes mysqli. The quickest fix is to replace the current RUN line with a simple apt‑get install of the MySQL client (e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client) and then remove the docker-php-ext-install mysqli && docker-php-ext-enable mysqli commands; this prevents the compile‑time error caused by missing libraries. If you still need to compile extensions, prepend the install of build essentials (e.g., apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config) and the appropriate dev packages (such as libmariadb-dev‑compat) before running docker-php-ext-install mysqli. After updating the Dockerfile accordingly, the image should build without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP 5.6‑Apache image still points to standard Debian mirrors that no longer serve the old snapshot repositories, so the “apt‑get update” step cannot find any package lists. Change the Dockerfile to replace the default sources with the historic archive URLs (as you already do) and then add the `--allow-releaseinfo-change` flag to the update command so apt will accept the expired metadata, for example: `apt-get update -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false -o Acquire::Check-Date=false --allow-releaseinfo-change`. After that, make sure the `apt-get install` line only requests packages that exist in the archived repository (e.g., `default-mysql-client` and any other tools you need) and clean up the apt cache as before. With those adjustments the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the old php:5.6‑apache image points to Debian repositories that are no longer available, so the `sed` commands that rewrite `/etc/apt/sources.list` end up leaving the file in an invalid state and `apt‑get update` cannot retrieve package lists, which also makes the `default‑mysql‑client` package unavailable. The quickest fix is to switch to a current, supported PHP base (for example `php:8.2-apache`) that uses an up‑to‑date Debian release, then drop the two `sed` lines and run a normal `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y default-mysql-client && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. This restores a functional package manager, pulls the MySQL client correctly, and allows the image to be built without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup does not include the Ghostscript service at all, therefore it cannot be using any of the listed vulnerable Ghostscript versions. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met (the code does not use a vulnerable version). Additionally, while the base image php:8.2-apache is built on Debian, the composition does not incorporate the Ghostscript service, so the required services list ['ghostscript', 'debian'] is not fully satisfied. Hence the 'services_ok' milestone fails.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup does not include the Ghostscript service at all, therefore it cannot be using any of the listed vulnerable Ghostscript versions. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met (the code does not use a vulnerable version). Additionally, while the base image php:8.2-apache is built on Debian, the composition does not incorporate the Ghostscript service, so the required services list ['ghostscript', 'debian'] is not fully satisfied. Hence the 'services_ok' milestone fails.
	- FIX: To satisfy the “code_hard_version” and “services_ok” milestones you need to add a Ghostscript container that runs a vulnerable 9.x or 8.x release on a Debian‑based image and link it to the existing web service. In the compose file declare a new service (e.g., ghostscript) that uses debian:stretch‑slim as the base, installs the specific Ghostscript package version (for example apt‑get install ghostscript=9.25‑*), and expose a port or mount a shared volume so the PHP app can invoke it; then adjust the web service’s Dockerfile or runtime configuration to call that Ghostscript binary instead of the default system one. This ensures both required services—Ghostscript at a vulnerable version and a Debian OS—are present, fulfilling the milestones.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Ghostscript package line in the ghostscript Dockerfile asks the Debian package manager to install a version with a glob pattern (`ghostscript=9.25*`). Debian’s apt‑get doesn’t accept wild‑cards in version specifications, so it can’t resolve a matching package and aborts the build. To fix it, replace that line with a concrete version that actually exists in the stretch‑slim repositories (for example `ghostscript=9.25~dfsg-0+deb9u1`) or, if you just need a vulnerable version, drop the version constraint entirely and let the builder install the latest 9.x series (`apt-get install -y ghostscript`). After changing the RUN statement to something like:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ghostscript=9.25~dfsg-0+deb9u1 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

or simply:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ghostscript && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

the Ghostscript image will build successfully and the whole compose stack can start.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the stretch‑slim image no longer has the exact 9.25 ghost‑script package in its standard archives, so the “apt‑get install ghostscript=9.25…” line cannot resolve a matching version. To fix it, change the Ghostscript Dockerfile to use the snapshot.debian.org archive for stretch (or add the old‑stretch security repository) and relax the version check, for example by replacing the repository lines with “deb http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20190501T000000Z stretch main” (and the corresponding security line), keeping the “Acquire::Check-Valid-Until false;” line, then run “apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --allow-downgrades ghostscript=9.25~dfsg-0+deb9u1”. This ensures the required version is available and the image can be built successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the stretch‑slim image does not contain the old package metadata needed to resolve the exact 9.25 ghost‑script version from the snapshot repository, and the unsigned snapshot URLs also trigger signature errors. Switch the base image to the full `debian:stretch` (or add the missing tools `gnupg2` and `ca-certificates`), then after writing the snapshot sources add the line `Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories "true";` (or use `[trusted=yes]` on each URL) so the apt client will accept the old, unsigned indices, run a normal `apt-get update`, and finally install the pinned version with a wildcard – e.g. `apt-get install -y ghostscript=9.25*`. Those small changes let the Dockerfile finish the image build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Ghostscript package can’t be found – the snapshot repository you add is missing the signing keys and the package index isn’t being refreshed correctly, so `apt-get install ghostscript=9.25…` returns “Unable to locate package”. Fix it by first installing the tools needed to trust the snapshot archives (gnupg and apt‑transport‑https), then add the snapshot sources, explicitly disable signature checking, update the package list, and finally force‑install the exact Ghostscript version. In practice you would modify the ghostscript Dockerfile to install `gnupg` (or `apt-transport-https` if you switch to an HTTPS snapshot URL), write the snapshot lines, add `Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories "true";` and `Acquire::Check-Valid-Until "false";`, run `apt-get update` with those options, and then run `apt-get install -y --allow-downgrades --no-install-recommends ghostscript=9.25~dfsg-0+deb9u1`. After the install you can clean up the apt cache as before. This sequence ensures the correct package is available and the image builds successfully.
