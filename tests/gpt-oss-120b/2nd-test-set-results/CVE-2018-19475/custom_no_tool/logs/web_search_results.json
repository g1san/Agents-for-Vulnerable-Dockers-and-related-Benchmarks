    "desc": "CVE-2018-19475 is a sandbox\u2011bypass vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter. A crafted PostScript document can cause Ghostscript to execute a %pipe% operator even when it is started with the -dSAFER option. The vulnerability resides in the restore handling code (psi/zdevice2.c) of Ghostscript versions prior to 9.26, allowing an attacker to overflow the operand stack, abort restoration of safety flags, and then set the OutputFile parameter to \"%pipe%<command>\". This results in arbitrary operating\u2011system command execution with the privileges of the Ghostscript process, leading to full system compromise.",
