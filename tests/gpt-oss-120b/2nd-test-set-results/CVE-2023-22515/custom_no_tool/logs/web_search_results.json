    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201122515 is a critical broken access\u2011control vulnerability affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center versions 8.0.0 through 8.5.1. The flaw resides in the public /setup/ endpoints (for example /setup/setupadministrator.action). An unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication checks and send specially crafted requests to these endpoints, causing the application to create a new user that is automatically placed in the confluence\u2011administrators group. This grants the attacker full administrative privileges on the Confluence instance, allowing data exfiltration, credential theft, malicious plug\u2011in installation and any other action that a legitimate administrator could perform. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without any credentials and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0 (Critical). Fixed versions are 8.3.3, 8.4.3, 8.5.2 LTS, and any later release. Until patched, external access to all /setup/* URLs should be blocked at the network or application layer.",
