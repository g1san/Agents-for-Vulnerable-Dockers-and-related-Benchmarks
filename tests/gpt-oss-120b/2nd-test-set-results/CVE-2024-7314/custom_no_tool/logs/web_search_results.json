    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u20117314 is an authentication\u2011bypass vulnerability in the anji\u2011plus AJ\u2011Report web application. An unauthenticated remote attacker can append the string `;swagger\u2011ui` to any HTTP request URL handled by AJ\u2011Report. This malformed request bypasses the normal login checks and reaches the Swagger UI endpoint, which is not protected. The Swagger UI exposes internal APIs that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server, resulting in full remote code execution and complete compromise of the affected host (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). The flaw affects all AJ\u2011Report releases prior to version 1.4.1 and can be exploited simply by sending a crafted HTTP request over the network; no credentials, user interaction, or prior access are required. The vulnerability is classified under CWE\u2011288 (Improper Authentication) and CWE\u2011280 (Improper Authorization).",
