    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20116271, also known as Shellshock, is a critical flaw in the GNU Bash (Bourne\u2011Again Shell) interpreter. Bash parses environment variables that contain function definitions. When a variable includes a function definition followed by additional characters after the closing brace, Bash incorrectly treats those trailing characters as normal command input and executes them. This means that any process which sets environment variables and then invokes Bash \u2013 such as CGI scripts invoked by a web server, OpenSSH's ForceCommand, DHCP client scripts, or other network daemons \u2013 can be tricked into executing attacker\u2011supplied commands. An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject a specially crafted string (for example `() { :;}; <malicious\u2011command>`) into an HTTP header, an SSH environment variable, or any other vector that becomes part of Bash's environment. When a vulnerable Bash version processes that input, the malicious command runs with the privileges of the Bash process, resulting in remote code execution. The original fix was incomplete, leading to a related advisory (CVE\u20112014\u20117169). The vulnerability affects Bash versions up to and including 4.3, and many earlier 4.2 releases. Systems that rely on Bash for script execution are therefore exposed unless they have been updated to Bash version 4.3\u201125 or later, or to any newer major release.",
