CVE description: CVE‑2014‑6271, also known as Shellshock, is a critical flaw in the GNU Bash (Bourne‑Again Shell) interpreter. Bash parses environment variables that contain function definitions. When a variable includes a function definition followed by additional characters after the closing brace, Bash incorrectly treats those trailing characters as normal command input and executes them. This means that any process which sets environment variables and then invokes Bash – such as CGI scripts invoked by a web server, OpenSSH's ForceCommand, DHCP client scripts, or other network daemons – can be tricked into executing attacker‑supplied commands. An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject a specially crafted string (for example `() { :;}; <malicious‑command>`) into an HTTP header, an SSH environment variable, or any other vector that becomes part of Bash's environment. When a vulnerable Bash version processes that input, the malicious command runs with the privileges of the Bash process, resulting in remote code execution. The original fix was incomplete, leading to a related advisory (CVE‑2014‑7169). The vulnerability affects Bash versions up to and including 4.3, and many earlier 4.2 releases. Systems that rely on Bash for script execution are therefore exposed unless they have been updated to Bash version 4.3‑25 or later, or to any newer major release.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][bash][['bash:4.2', 'bash:4.2.42', 'bash:4.2.45', 'bash:4.2.46', 'bash:4.3', 'bash:4.3.30']] Vulnerable Bash interpreter that contains the Shellshock flaw. Required to reproduce the vulnerability inside the Docker container.
- [SOFT-WEB][httpd][['httpd:2.4.54']] Apache HTTP Server used to expose a CGI endpoint that invokes Bash, allowing the crafted header to reach the vulnerable Bash process.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the package name `libapache2-mod-cgi` does not exist in the Ubuntu 14.04 repositories, so the `apt‑get install` step aborts; you can fix this by installing only the core `apache2` package (which already includes the CGI module) and then enabling the correct module with `a2enmod cgi` (or `cgid` if you prefer the threaded MPM). After that, the rest of the Dockerfile – copying the vulnerable script, setting it executable, exposing port 80 and launching Apache with `apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND` – will build successfully.


Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
