    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201114144 is a vulnerability in the self\u2011hosted Git service Gitea. Versions from 1.1.0 through 1.12.5 allow an authenticated user who has the permission to create or modify Git hooks to upload a malicious post\u2011receive hook via the web UI. The hook is executed by the Gitea process each time a push is received, giving the attacker the ability to run arbitrary commands on the host with the privileges of the Gitea user. This results in remote code execution and can lead to full system compromise if the Gitea process is not isolated. The issue was fixed in Gitea 1.13.0, where custom Git hooks are disabled by default.",
