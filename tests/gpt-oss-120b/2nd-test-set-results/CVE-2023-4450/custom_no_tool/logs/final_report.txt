CVE description: CVE‑2023‑4450 is a critical vulnerability in the JimuReport module of the JeecgBoot low‑code platform.  The flaw resides in the "Template Handler" component that processes the `sql` parameter of the HTTP POST endpoint `/jmreport/queryFieldBySql`.  The supplied value is directly embedded in a FreeMarker template and evaluated without any sanitisation.  An attacker can supply a FreeMarker payload that creates an instance of `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` (or other utility classes) and thereby execute arbitrary operating‑system commands on the server.  The vulnerability affects all JeecgBoot releases that bundle JimuReport version 1.6.0 or older (i.e., versions ≤ 1.6.0).  Successful exploitation requires no authentication and results in full remote code execution, allowing data theft, modification, service disruption, lateral movement and privilege escalation.  The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.8 (Critical).  Mitigation consists of upgrading JimuReport to version 1.6.1 or later, restricting access to the vulnerable endpoint, and disabling unsafe FreeMarker utilities.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines only two services: app (a Node.js application) and db (MySQL 5.7). The required service list includes 'jeecgboot' and 'nginx', which are absent, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, there is no 'jeecgboot' service, therefore no version of jeecgboot is used, and the image does not match any of the allowed jeecgboot versions, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines only two services: app (a Node.js application) and db (MySQL 5.7). The required service list includes 'jeecgboot' and 'nginx', which are absent, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, there is no 'jeecgboot' service, therefore no version of jeecgboot is used, and the image does not match any of the allowed jeecgboot versions, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required service list you must add a JeecgBoot container and an Nginx reverse‑proxy to the compose file, then reference a JeecgBoot image that contains the JimuReport module version 1.5.x (or any version from the allowed list) so the “code_hard_version” check passes; for example, use an image tag such as jeecgboot:1.5.6 and define it as a service named jeecgboot with the same environment variables the application needs. Next, create an Nginx service that links to the JeecgBoot container (e.g., forwarding port 8080) and expose the appropriate ports. Finally, adjust the existing app service to depend on jeecgboot instead of the MySQL‑only setup, or keep the MySQL service if JeecgBoot requires it, and update any network aliases so the three services can communicate, thereby allowing the milestone checks to succeed.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Docker is trying to pull an image named `jeecgboot:1.5.6` that doesn’t exist in any registry and there is no local Dockerfile to build it, so the compose launch aborts before it even gets to the `app` service. The quick fix is to replace that reference with a real, pullable image (for example `jeecgboot:latest` or the exact tag that the project publishes) or add a `build:` section that points to a Dockerfile that creates the JeecgBoot image. While you’re at it, upgrade the Node base image to a supported LTS (e.g. `node:18`) so the `npm install` step won’t hit deprecation‑related errors. Once the `jeecgboot` service can start, the rest of the compose file will build and run without the earlier termination.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Docker cannot find a valid image for the jeecgboot service – you reference image: jeecgboot:latest but no such image exists locally and there is no Dockerfile to build it, so the compose run aborts. Fix it by either pulling a published JeecgBoot image (e.g. image: jeecgboot/jeecg-boot:1.6.0) or, if you have source code, replace the image key with a build: section that points at a directory containing a proper Dockerfile for JeecgBoot. Once the service can be built or pulled, the compose file will start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because Docker can’t locate a valid base image for the jeecgboot service – the tag `jeecgboot/jeecg-boot:1.5.9` doesn’t exist in any public registry, so the pull fails and the whole composition aborts. To fix it, edit `docker-compose.yml` and replace the non‑existent tag with a real one (for example `jeecgboot/jeecg-boot:latest` or any other version that is listed on Docker Hub). Once the image reference points to a downloadable image, the compose file will bring up all containers without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the node‑serialize module used in the app does not compile under the Node 18 image you’re pulling, so the `npm install` step aborts; the quickest fix is to base the Dockerfile on a Node version that the library still supports (for example node:14‑slim), then rebuild the image—replace the first line of ./app/Dockerfile with `FROM node:14-slim` (or another compatible LTS release), keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged, and run `docker compose up --build` again. This change lets the dependency install succeed and the service start without modifying any other code.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the slim Node 14 base you’re using doesn’t contain the libraries needed for npm to resolve and install the node‑serialize package (it expects a full‑featured environment with a working npm registry cache and the ability to compile any optional native modules). Switch the base image to a more complete Node version—e.g. `node:16-bullseye`—or install the missing utilities (git, python, make, gcc) before running `npm install`. In practice the quickest fix is to change the first line of the Dockerfile to `FROM node:16-bullseye` (or any recent non‑slim tag), then keep the existing `WORKDIR`, `COPY package.json .`, `RUN npm install`, `COPY . .` sequence; the build will succeed and the container will start normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile copies only package.json into the image and runs npm install before the rest of the source files are present, so the node‑serialize dependency cannot be resolved when the later COPY . . overwrites the node_modules directory and breaks the installation. Fix it by copying the entire application directory first (or at least the package.json and package-lock.json together), then running npm ci or npm install once, and finally copying the remaining source files. In practice, change the Dockerfile to:

```
FROM node:16-bullseye
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci   # or npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node","server.js"]
```

This ensures the dependency tree is installed correctly before the source files are added, eliminating the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile uses `npm ci`, which expects a `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` to be present, and the source directory only contains a `package.json`. Change the install step to run `npm install` instead (or generate a lock file), for example replace `RUN npm ci` with `RUN npm install`. After that the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Node service copies the entire source tree before installing its dependencies, which means npm tries to process files that don’t belong in package.json (e.g., the Dockerfile itself) and can also pick up a stray package-lock.json that is out‑of‑sync with the declared versions, causing the install step to abort. Move the COPY commands so only the manifest files are added first, run npm install there, and then copy the application code; for example, change the Dockerfile to copy package.json (and package-lock.json if present) into /usr/src/app, run npm ci or npm install, and finally COPY . . This ensures a clean dependency install and resolves the build error. Additionally, verify that the JeecgBoot image tag you reference actually exists (e.g., use a known‑good tag or build the image yourself) so Docker Compose can pull it successfully.
