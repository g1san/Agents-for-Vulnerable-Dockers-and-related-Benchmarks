    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u20114450 is a critical vulnerability in the JimuReport module of the JeecgBoot low\u2011code platform.  The flaw resides in the \"Template Handler\" component that processes the `sql` parameter of the HTTP POST endpoint `/jmreport/queryFieldBySql`.  The supplied value is directly embedded in a FreeMarker template and evaluated without any sanitisation.  An attacker can supply a FreeMarker payload that creates an instance of `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` (or other utility classes) and thereby execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the server.  The vulnerability affects all JeecgBoot releases that bundle JimuReport version 1.6.0 or older (i.e., versions \u2264\u202f1.6.0).  Successful exploitation requires no authentication and results in full remote code execution, allowing data theft, modification, service disruption, lateral movement and privilege escalation.  The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.8 (Critical).  Mitigation consists of upgrading JimuReport to version\u202f1.6.1 or later, restricting access to the vulnerable endpoint, and disabling unsafe FreeMarker utilities.",
