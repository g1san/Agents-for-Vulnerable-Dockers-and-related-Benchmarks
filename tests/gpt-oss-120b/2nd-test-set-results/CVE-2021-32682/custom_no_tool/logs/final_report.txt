CVE description: CVE‑2021‑32682 is a critical vulnerability in the elFinder web‑based file manager. The flaw resides in the default PHP connector (e.g., `connector.minimal.php` or `connector.php`) that ships with elFinder versions up to 2.1.58. The connector mishandles user‑controlled parameters in several commands – notably the `upload`, `mkfile`, and `archive` commands. It fails to properly validate uploaded file names, MIME types, and path components, allowing an attacker to:
1. Upload a file with a `.php` (or other executable) extension disguised as an allowed type and execute it directly via a web request.
2. Perform directory‑traversal and arbitrary file‑move/rename operations, enabling replacement of critical configuration files.
3. Inject arguments into the system `zip` utility through the `archive` command, leading to execution of arbitrary shell commands.
These primitives can be chained to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with the privileges of the web‑server process, resulting in full server compromise, data theft, and persistence. The vulnerability is present in all releases of elFinder prior to 2.1.59; patches released in 2.1.59 address path validation, block `.phar` uploads, and harden the archive command.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][elfinder][['2.1.57', '2.1.58']] Vulnerable PHP connector for elFinder; provides the file‑manager endpoint that contains the insecure upload and archive handling allowing exploitation of CVE‑2021‑32682.
- [SOFT-WEB][php][['8.0-apache']] Web server with PHP interpreter required to run the elFinder connector; serves the vulnerable PHP files and executes uploaded payloads.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is likely failing because the Flask CLI isn’t finding the FLASK_APP environment variable when the image starts, so the flask run command exits immediately. Add an ENV line in the Dockerfile to set FLASK_APP=app.py and change the CMD to invoke the module directly, e.g., CMD ["python","-m","flask","run","--host=0.0.0.0","--port=5000"] instead of relying on the environment from compose; this guarantees the app is launched correctly. After rebuilding the image and restarting the compose stack, the service should start without errors.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the compose file overwrites the Dockerfile’s CMD with a plain `flask run` that doesn’t inherit the working‑directory or environment settings defined in the image, so Flask can’t locate app.py when it starts. Fix it by removing the custom `command:` line from the docker‑compose.yml or replace it with the exact same invocation used in the Dockerfile (e.g., `python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000`). With the image’s CMD restored, the app will start correctly using the FLASK_APP environment variable that is already set in the Dockerfile.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image builds a Python Flask application. No elfinder library or php runtime is present in the Dockerfile, requirements.txt, or the application code. Consequently, the image does not use the elfinder service at any version, let alone the vulnerable versions 2.1.57 or 2.1.58, and it also lacks a php service. Therefore both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones are not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Docker image builds a Python Flask application. No elfinder library or php runtime is present in the Dockerfile, requirements.txt, or the application code. Consequently, the image does not use the elfinder service at any version, let alone the vulnerable versions 2.1.57 or 2.1.58, and it also lacks a php service. Therefore both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones are not satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required milestones you must add a PHP environment that provides the vulnerable elFinder connector alongside the existing Flask service. First, create a separate Dockerfile (or extend the current one) that installs Apache (or another web server) with PHP 8, copies the elFinder source (including `connector.minimal.php` from version 2.1.57/2.1.58) into the web root, and configures the server to serve that directory; then reference this image in a new service definition (e.g., `elfinder`) in docker‑compose.yml, exposing the appropriate port. Finally, adjust the compose file so that both services—`vulnerable-app` (the Flask API) and `elfinder` (the PHP‑based file manager)—are declared, thereby providing the hard‑coded vulnerable component and meeting the `code_hard_version` and `services_ok` criteria.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
