    "desc": "CVE-2023-26031 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache Hadoop YARN. The native `container-executor` binary, which must be owned by root and have the set\u2011uid bit set for secure container launches, was changed to load shared libraries from a relative run\u2011path `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. An unprivileged user can write a malicious `libcrypto.so` (or other shared library) into a directory that resolves to this run\u2011path. When `container\u2011executor` is invoked, the malicious library is loaded and executed with root privileges, allowing the attacker to obtain a root shell. The flaw affects Hadoop versions 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 on Linux. It can be exploited locally by any user who can write to the vulnerable library path, and remotely if the YARN cluster accepts job submissions from authenticated users that run on the host without proper container isolation. The vulnerability is fixed in Hadoop 3.3.5, which reverts the run\u2011path change.",
