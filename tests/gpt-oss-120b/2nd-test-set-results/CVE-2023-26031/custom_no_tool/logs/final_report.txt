CVE description: CVE-2023-26031 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache Hadoop YARN. The native `container-executor` binary, which must be owned by root and have the set‑uid bit set for secure container launches, was changed to load shared libraries from a relative run‑path `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. An unprivileged user can write a malicious `libcrypto.so` (or other shared library) into a directory that resolves to this run‑path. When `container‑executor` is invoked, the malicious library is loaded and executed with root privileges, allowing the attacker to obtain a root shell. The flaw affects Hadoop versions 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 on Linux. It can be exploited locally by any user who can write to the vulnerable library path, and remotely if the YARN cluster accepts job submissions from authenticated users that run on the host without proper container isolation. The vulnerability is fixed in Hadoop 3.3.5, which reverts the run‑path change.
Attack Type: privilege escalation
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/hadoop][['3.3.1', '3.3.2', '3.3.3', '3.3.4']] Provides the Hadoop YARN service with the vulnerable container-executor binary. Versions 3.3.1‑3.3.4 contain the insecure RUNPATH that enables loading of a malicious library as root.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only a Redis service (redis:6.2.6) and a custom Flask webapp built from python:3.10‑slim. No apache/hadoop image is used, so the required service list ['apache/hadoop'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Consequently, there is no apache/hadoop version to compare against the vulnerable versions ['3.3.1','3.3.2','3.3.3','3.3.4']; because the service is absent, the code does not use a vulnerable HARD version (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only a Redis service (redis:6.2.6) and a custom Flask webapp built from python:3.10‑slim. No apache/hadoop image is used, so the required service list ['apache/hadoop'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Consequently, there is no apache/hadoop version to compare against the vulnerable versions ['3.3.1','3.3.2','3.3.3','3.3.4']; because the service is absent, the code does not use a vulnerable HARD version (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: Add a Hadoop YARN service to the compose file using an image that provides the vulnerable apache/hadoop binary (for example docker.io/apache/hadoop:3.3.4) and give it a distinct container name, then expose the required ports (e.g. 8032, 8088) and set any environment variables needed for YARN to start. By including this service the compose stack now contains a HARD dependency that matches one of the vulnerable versions, so the detection logic will see services_ok as true and code_hard_version as true. No other changes to the Flask or Redis services are required.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim Python base image does not contain the tools needed to install the Flask CLI entry‑point and the Redis client cleanly; adding the missing system packages and making sure the Flask command is run from the container’s environment fixes the problem. Edit the Dockerfile so that it updates the package index, installs the small set of native tools required for pip (e.g., `build-essential` and `libffi-dev`), and then proceeds with the pip install; also replace the `flask run …` command with an explicit `python -m flask …` call (or add the Flask binary’s location to `PATH`) so the container can locate the executable at start‑up. After these few changes the image builds without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Hadoop service is trying to pull an image tag that does not exist on Docker Hub – `apache/hadoop:3.3.4` isn’t published, so Docker can’t resolve the image reference. To fix it, either point the service to a valid tag (for example `apache/hadoop:3.3.4‑hadoop‑3.3.4` or whatever the exact repository name is) or add a local Dockerfile that builds the vulnerable version from source and change the compose entry to `build: ./hadoop‑image` instead of `image:`. Once the Hadoop image resolves, the Python‑based webapp will also build correctly; the only other tweak you might need is to install `libssl-dev` (or any other missing native library) in the Python Dockerfile if the pip install of Flask/Redis fails, which you can do by adding it to the `apt‑get install` line. After correcting the Hadoop image reference (or providing a local build) and ensuring all native build dependencies are present, the compose stack will start without the previous image‑not‑found error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Hadoop Dockerfile tries to change ownership of the container‑executor binary to root inside a container that runs as the default non‑root user, and the base openjdk:8‑jdk‑slim image does not contain a root user with write access to /opt/hadoop/bin. To fix it, add a USER root statement before the chmod/chown commands (or run the whole Dockerfile as root, which is the default for most official images) and then, after setting the set‑uid bit, switch back to a non‑privileged user for the rest of the image (e.g., USER 1000). Also make sure the wget download succeeds by installing ca‑certificates so TLS works, and remove the stray “&& \” after the rm command that could leave the line hanging. With these changes the image will build without permission errors and the demonstration of the CVE will work.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to change the mode and ownership of `$HADOOP_HOME/bin/container‑executor` before the binary actually exists in the extracted Hadoop distribution; the tarball does not contain that file by default, so the `chmod` and `chown` commands return “No such file or directory”. To fix it, remove the two lines that modify `container‑executor` (or replace them with a step that first builds/install the native YARN binaries so the file is present) and keep the image running as the default non‑root user after the Hadoop installation. In practice the Dockerfile should install Hadoop, extract the archive, and then immediately switch to `USER 1000` without trying to set the set‑uid bit on a missing binary. This change eliminates the build‑time error while still providing a functional Hadoop node for the rest of the composition.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the image switches to UID 1000 without first creating a matching account, so Docker cannot set the user at runtime. Add a step that creates a non‑privileged user (for example, `RUN adduser --uid 1000 --disabled-password --gecos "" hadoopuser`) before the `USER 1000` line (or simply remove the `USER` instruction to run as root if you need the `container‑executor` set‑uid binary). With the user present, the container will start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim JDK image does not contain the tar utility that the Dockerfile uses to unpack the Hadoop archive, and because the Hadoop‑user is switched to before the required runtime directories (such as /tmp/hadoop‑… and /var/log/hadoop) are created and owned. To fix it, add tar to the list of packages installed in the apt‑get command (e.g., apt‑get install -y wget gnupg ca‑certificates tar) and create the needed Hadoop directories with the proper ownership before the USER hadoopuser line (for example, mkdir -p $HADOOP_HOME/tmp $HADOOP_HOME/logs && chown -R hadoopuser:hadoopuser $HADOOP_HOME). Optionally, write the PATH environment variable with explicit expansion ( ENV PATH="${HADOOP_HOME}/bin:${PATH}" ) to avoid any interpolation issues. After these changes the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim image does not contain the adduser utility that the Dockerfile calls, so the user‑creation step aborts; you can fix it by installing the adduser package (apt‑get install -y adduser) before invoking adduser. Additionally, the Hadoop container‑executor binary must retain its set‑uid‑root bit, so you should either keep the container running as root (remove the USER hadoopuser line) or create the user after the binary is placed and then explicitly set the binary’s ownership back to root and its mode to 4755 with chown root:root and chmod 4755. Making these two changes—adding the adduser package and ensuring the set‑uid binary is owned by root—will allow the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to set the set‑uid bit on $HADOOP_HOME/bin/container‑executor before that binary actually exists in the extracted Hadoop distribution; on Hadoop 3.3.4 the executable lives in $HADOOP_HOME/sbin, so the chmod command returns “No such file or directory”. To fix it, change the Dockerfile to point to the correct location (e.g. chmod 4755 $HADOOP_HOME/sbin/container‑executor) or, better yet, drop the set‑uid bit entirely and run the container‑executor without privileged escalation (use a regular 0755 chmod and run the service as a non‑root user). After correcting the path or permission command the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
