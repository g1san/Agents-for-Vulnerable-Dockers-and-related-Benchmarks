    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20113714, also known as ImageTragick, is a remote code execution vulnerability in the ImageMagick library. Certain image coders (such as EPHEMERAL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN and PLT) construct system\u2011level commands from image data without proper sanitisation. An attacker can embed shell metacharacters in a specially crafted image (for example an SVG or MVG file) which ImageMagick processes via the `convert` or `identify` utilities. When the vulnerable ImageMagick version processes the image, the malicious command is executed by the operating system with the privileges of the process (typically the web\u2011server user). This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution on the host, leading to full compromise of the affected system.",
