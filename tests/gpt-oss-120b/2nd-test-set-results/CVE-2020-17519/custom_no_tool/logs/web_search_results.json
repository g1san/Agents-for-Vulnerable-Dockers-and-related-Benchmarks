    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201117519 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Apache Flink JobManager REST API. The vulnerable endpoint builds the file path to serve using the raw path parameter supplied by the client without any sanitisation. An attacker can supply encoded \"..\" sequences (e.g., `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd`) which are decoded and concatenated with the log directory, allowing arbitrary files on the JobManager host to be read. The flaw exists in Flink versions 1.11.0, 1.11.1 and 1.11.2 and is fixed starting with version 1.11.3. Exploitation requires only network access to the JobManager REST port (default 8081); no authentication is needed. The attacker sends a GET request such as `GET /jobmanager/logs/..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd HTTP/1.1` and receives the file content in the HTTP response, exposing credentials, configuration files, or any other readable data on the host.",
