CVE description: CVE‑2020‑17519 is a directory‑traversal vulnerability in the Apache Flink JobManager REST API. The vulnerable endpoint builds the file path to serve using the raw path parameter supplied by the client without any sanitisation. An attacker can supply encoded ".." sequences (e.g., `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd`) which are decoded and concatenated with the log directory, allowing arbitrary files on the JobManager host to be read. The flaw exists in Flink versions 1.11.0, 1.11.1 and 1.11.2 and is fixed starting with version 1.11.3. Exploitation requires only network access to the JobManager REST port (default 8081); no authentication is needed. The attacker sends a GET request such as `GET /jobmanager/logs/..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd HTTP/1.1` and receives the file content in the HTTP response, exposing credentials, configuration files, or any other readable data on the host.
Attack Type: arbitrary file read
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/flink][['1.11.0', '1.11.1', '1.11.2']] Apache Flink JobManager with the vulnerable REST API that allows directory‑traversal file reads.

# CVE-2020-17519 Docker Test Environment

This repository contains a minimal Docker Compose setup that reproduces **CVE-2020-17519** using the vulnerable Drupal 8.9.0 image.

## Services
- **db** – MariaDB 10.5 used as the backend database.
- **drupal** – Drupal 8.9.0 (the vulnerable version) served on port **8080**.

## Getting Started
```bash
# From the directory containing docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```
The Drupal site will be reachable at `http://localhost:8080`. You can complete the Drupal installation wizard and use the provided database credentials.

After the installation, the known vulnerability (CVE-2020-17519) can be tested using standard public PoC scripts or by attempting the crafted request described in the CVE advisory.

## Cleanup
```bash
docker compose down -v
```






Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker Compose setup defines two services: 'db' based on the mariadb:10.5 image and 'drupal' based on the drupal:8.9.0 image. Neither service uses the 'apache/flink' software, and therefore no version of apache/flink (1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2) is present. Consequently, the code does not use a vulnerable version of the specified HARD service, and the required service 'apache/flink' is not included in the composition. Both milestones fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker Compose setup defines two services: 'db' based on the mariadb:10.5 image and 'drupal' based on the drupal:8.9.0 image. Neither service uses the 'apache/flink' software, and therefore no version of apache/flink (1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2) is present. Consequently, the code does not use a vulnerable version of the specified HARD service, and the required service 'apache/flink' is not included in the composition. Both milestones fail.
	- FIX: To address the mismatch, replace the Drupal service with an Apache Flink JobManager container that runs a vulnerable 1.11.x release (for example, use the image apache/flink:1.11.2‑scala_2.11) and add a corresponding TaskManager if needed, then expose the JobManager’s REST port (8081) so the directory‑traversal endpoint is reachable. Keep the MariaDB service if you need a database for other tests, but remove the Drupal service or rename it to a Flink JobManager service and adjust the compose file’s volumes and environment variables to match Flink’s defaults, thereby ensuring the required “apache/flink” service version is actually present in the stack.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build error is caused by the fact that the compose file references the Flink images `apache/flink:1.11.2‑scala_2.11` without first pulling them, and the Docker engine is trying to treat them as build contexts; to fix it, add an explicit `pull_policy: always` (or `image: apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.11` with `pull_policy: always`) under each service, or run `docker pull apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.11` before executing `docker compose up`. This ensures the required images are available locally and the compose file can start the containers without a build step, eliminating the termination error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because it omits a version header and uses the “pull_policy” option that many Docker‑Compose releases don’t recognise; adding an explicit version (for example `version: "3.8"`) and either removing the unsupported `pull_policy` lines or replacing them with a supported `pull_policy: always` under the `image` key will let Compose parse the file correctly and pull the images without error. After those minor edits the services start normally and the vulnerable Flink JobManager can be reached on port 8081.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is most likely caused by the bind‑mount of `init.sql` – the path `./init.sql` is resolved relative to the compose file’s location, and if Docker can’t find that file (or the compose process runs from a different working directory) the container startup aborts with a “mount source does not exist” error. To fix it, make the mount explicit and guarantee the file is present by either (1) moving the `init.sql` file into the same directory as the `docker‑compose.yml` and confirming the file name matches exactly, or (2) replacing the relative source with an absolute path (e.g., `${PWD}/init.sql`) and adding the `type: bind` option. After correcting the mount, `docker compose up -d` will pull the pre‑built Flink images (no Dockerfile needs to be built) and the services will start normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file uses the `${PWD}` variable in the bind‑mount definition, which isn’t automatically expanded by Docker Compose and results in an invalid source path; replace that line with a plain relative path (e.g., `source: ./init.sql`) and remove the extra `type: bind` block if you’re using version 2 syntax, or keep the block but set `source: ./init.sql`. After correcting the source path the services will start without the image‑building error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the Flink image tag you reference does not exist on Docker Hub, so Docker cannot pull it while trying to start the service; replace `apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.11` with a valid tag such as `apache/flink:1.11.2` (or upgrade to the fixed `1.11.3` version if you only need a working cluster) and then rerun `docker compose up`. If the init script mount is still problematic, change the relative path to an absolute one (e.g., `${PWD}/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro`) so the DB container can locate the file during startup. After these adjustments the compose should start without image‑pull or volume‑mount errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the compose file lacking a version header and by referencing an image tag that does not exist in the public registry; adding a version line (for example `version: "3.8"` at the top of the file) and correcting the Flink image name to a valid tag—such as `apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.11` or another exact tag listed on Docker Hub—will allow Docker to resolve the image and start the services without error. After making those two small edits, run `docker compose up -d` again and the environment should launch correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the image tag `apache/flink:1.11.2‑scala_2.11` is not published in Docker Hub, so Docker cannot pull it; replace it with a tag that actually exists such as `apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.11` (note the dash instead of the underscore) or simply `apache/flink:1.11.2`. After updating the `image:` lines for both the jobmanager and taskmanager services to a valid tag, run `docker compose pull` or `docker compose up -d` again and the containers will start without the image‑not‑found error. If the problem is a missing `init.sql` file, make sure the file resides in the same directory as the compose file (or adjust the host‑side path) so the volume mount `./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro` resolves correctly. This small change restores normal startup.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file tries to pull the image `apache/flink:1.11.2‑scala_2.11`, which either does not exist on Docker Hub or has been removed, so Docker cannot resolve the tag. Change the `image` reference for both `jobmanager` and `taskmanager` to a valid tag—e.g., `apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.12` or upgrade to the patched `apache/flink:1.11.3-scala_2.11`—and then run `docker compose up -d` again. If you need to keep the exact version, add a `build:` section that points to a Dockerfile that pulls the desired base image and copies any needed files, ensuring the compose file only references a local build context rather than an unavailable remote tag. This adjustment eliminates the image‑resolution error and lets the stack start normally.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
