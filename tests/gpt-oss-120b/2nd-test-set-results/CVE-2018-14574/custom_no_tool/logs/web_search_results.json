{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201114574 is an open\u2011redirect vulnerability in Django's CommonMiddleware. When APPEND_SLASH is enabled, the middleware may construct a redirect URL that starts with a double slash (//) after appending a trailing slash to a request path. Because the redirect validation only checks the scheme of the original request, a URL such as //evil.com is treated as a valid absolute URL and the browser follows the redirect to an attacker\u2011controlled site. This allows an attacker to craft links that appear to originate from the vulnerable Django application but actually lead users to phishing pages, credential\u2011harvesting sites, or other malicious destinations. The flaw is present in Django 1.11.x versions prior to 1.11.15 and Django 2.0.x versions prior to 2.0.8.",
