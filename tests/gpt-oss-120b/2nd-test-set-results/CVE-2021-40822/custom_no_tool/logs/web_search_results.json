    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201140822 is a server\u2011side request forgery vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the handling of user\u2011supplied URLs by the TestWfsPost servlet and the proxy\u2011host configuration used for remote OWS services. When an attacker sends a crafted POST request to the /geoserver/wfs/TestWfsPost endpoint (or modifies the proxy\u2011host setting), GeoServer forwards the supplied URL using its internal Apache HTTP client without proper validation. This allows the server to make arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests to internal or external addresses, exposing internal network topology, leaking data, and providing a foothold for further attacks such as credential harvesting or lateral movement. The vulnerability is present in all GeoServer releases prior to the fix versions (2.24.4 and 2.25.2) and in specific older branches (\u22642.18.5 and 2.19.0\u20112.19.2). No authentication is required to exploit the issue.",
