CVE description: CVE‑2021‑40822 is a server‑side request forgery vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the handling of user‑supplied URLs by the TestWfsPost servlet and the proxy‑host configuration used for remote OWS services. When an attacker sends a crafted POST request to the /geoserver/wfs/TestWfsPost endpoint (or modifies the proxy‑host setting), GeoServer forwards the supplied URL using its internal Apache HTTP client without proper validation. This allows the server to make arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests to internal or external addresses, exposing internal network topology, leaking data, and providing a foothold for further attacks such as credential harvesting or lateral movement. The vulnerability is present in all GeoServer releases prior to the fix versions (2.24.4 and 2.25.2) and in specific older branches (≤2.18.5 and 2.19.0‑2.19.2). No authentication is required to exploit the issue.
Attack Type: Server‑Side Request Forgery

- [HARD][geoserver/geoserver][['2.18.5', '2.19.0', '2.19.1', '2.19.2', '2.20.0', '2.20.1', '2.20.2', '2.20.3', '2.20.4', '2.21.0', '2.21.1', '2.21.2', '2.21.3', '2.21.4', '2.22.0', '2.22.1', '2.22.2', '2.22.3', '2.22.4', '2.23.0', '2.23.1', '2.23.2', '2.23.3', '2.23.4', '2.24.0', '2.24.1', '2.24.2', '2.24.3']] GeoServer provides the vulnerable TestWfsPost servlet and proxy‑host configuration that enable the server‑side request forgery. Deploying a vulnerable version of this container makes the system exploitable.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13']] Optional relational database used by GeoServer for storing configuration and metadata; required only to run GeoServer in a typical deployment but not for the vulnerability itself.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The docker-compose file defines a web service built from php:5.6-apache and a db service based on mysql:5.7. Neither geoserver/geoserver nor postgres images are used, so the required services list is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, no geoserver image is present, therefore no vulnerable geoserver version from the provided list is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The docker-compose file defines a web service built from php:5.6-apache and a db service based on mysql:5.7. Neither geoserver/geoserver nor postgres images are used, so the required services list is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, no geoserver image is present, therefore no vulnerable geoserver version from the provided list is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services you should add a GeoServer container using a vulnerable version (for example geoserver/geoserver:2.23.4) and replace the current MySQL‑based database with the listed PostgreSQL image (postgres:13); adjust the web service to depend on the new “db” service and update the PHP connection parameters (host = db, user = postgres, password = your‑password, database = your‑db) so the application can talk to PostgreSQL. In the compose file define the “geoserver” service with the appropriate image and expose its ports, and change the “depends_on” list for the web service to include both “geoserver” and “db”. This brings the stack in line with the hard‑dependency list and makes the vulnerable GeoServer version actually present.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image is being asked to install the MySQL mysqli extension while the application actually talks to PostgreSQL, and the PHP code then tries to use `new mysqli()` against a Postgres host – a combination that cannot work. The quick fix is to install the PostgreSQL client extensions instead of (or in addition to) the MySQL ones and change the PHP script to use a PostgreSQL‑compatible API. In the Dockerfile replace the current `RUN` line with something like:

```dockerfile
RUN docker-php-ext-install pgsql pdo_pgsql && a2enmod rewrite
```

(and you can drop `mysqli` unless you also need MySQL elsewhere). Then edit `app/index.php` so it uses either the native `pg_connect`/`pg_query` functions or PDO with the `pgsql` driver; for example:

```php
$dsn = "pgsql:host=$host;port=5432;dbname=$db;";
$conn = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
$id = (int)$_GET['id'];
$stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = :id');
$stmt->execute(['id' => $id]);
foreach ($stmt as $row) {
    echo 'User: ' . htmlspecialchars($row['username']) .
         ' Email: ' . htmlspecialchars($row['email']) . "<br>";
}
```

By installing the correct extensions and using a matching database API, the image builds successfully and the PHP container can talk to the Postgres container without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php:5.6‑apache image does not have the PostgreSQL client headers required to compile the pgsql and pdo_pgsql extensions, so the “docker-php-ext-install pgsql pdo_pgsql” step aborts. Edit the Dockerfile to first install the native dependency (for example libpq-dev) and then run the extension installer, e.g. add a line `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpq-dev && docker-php-ext-install pgsql pdo_pgsql && a2enmod rewrite && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. Alternatively, switch to a supported PHP image (such as php:7.4‑apache or php:8.2‑apache) where the extensions are available, and then run the same install commands. After adding the missing package (or updating the base image) the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the old php:5.6‑apache image no longer provides the libraries needed to compile the PostgreSQL extensions, so the “docker‑php‑ext‑install pgsql pdo_pgsql” step aborts. Switch the base image to a supported PHP version (for example php:7.4‑apache), then install the PostgreSQL client development package before running the extension installer, e.g. RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --no‑install‑recommends libpq-dev && docker‑php‑ext‑install pdo_pgsql pgsql && a2enmod rewrite && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*. This change restores the missing build dependencies and allows the image to be built successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base image you’re using (php:7.4‑apache) has been retired, so Docker can’t pull it; switch to a current supported tag such as php:8.2‑apache, then install the PostgreSQL client libraries and compile the PHP extensions in the same RUN statement (apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y libpq-dev && docker-php-ext-install pdo_pgsql pgsql && a2enmod rewrite && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*). After updating the FROM line and keeping the COPY of index.php, the image will build correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP PostgreSQL extensions are being compiled without the necessary build tools and library headers. Edit the Dockerfile so that it first installs the compiler suite (e.g. build‑essential) together with libpq‑dev, then runs docker‑php‑ext‑install for each extension, and finally cleans up the extra packages. For example, replace the RUN line with a multi‑step command that apt‑gets install build‑essential libpq‑dev, runs docker‑php‑ext‑install pdo_pgsql pgsql, and then removes the build packages and apt caches. After this change the image will build successfully and the PHP app will be able to connect to the PostgreSQL container.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP PostgreSQL extensions can’t be compiled – the required PostgreSQL development files aren’t fully present. Add the PostgreSQL client package (which provides pg_config) to the apt‑get line in the Dockerfile, then reinstall the extensions and clean up the apt cache; for example, modify the Dockerfile so the first RUN installs both libpq-dev and postgresql-client, runs docker‑php‑ext‑install pdo_pgsql pgsql, enables rewrite, and finally removes /var/lib/apt/lists/*. This supplies the missing compilation tools and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP image can’t compile the PostgreSQL extensions as written; the simplest fix is to install only the `pdo_pgsql` extension (the plain `pgsql` extension isn’t needed for PDO) and explicitly enable it after it’s compiled. Change the Dockerfile so the RUN line installs the required library, builds the extension, and then enables it, for example:

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.2-apache
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        build-essential libpq-dev postgresql-client && \
    docker-php-ext-install pdo_pgsql && \
    docker-php-ext-enable pdo_pgsql && \
    a2enmod rewrite && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY index.php /var/www/html/
```

With this change the image will compile successfully and the rest of the compose file can run unchanged.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the PHP image not having the PostgreSQL client libraries and header files that the pdo_pgsql extension needs, so the docker‑php‑ext‑install step aborts. Fix it by extending the Dockerfile to install libpq-dev (and, on recent Debian‑based bases, also libssl-dev to satisfy the compile‑time SSL dependency) before invoking docker‑php‑ext‑install, and then clean the apt cache after the installation. In practice you would replace the current RUN line with something like: 

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        build-essential libpq-dev libssl-dev postgresql-client && \
    docker-php-ext-install pdo_pgsql && \
    a2enmod rewrite && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
``` 

This ensures the required libraries are present, the extension compiles successfully, and the image can be built without error.
