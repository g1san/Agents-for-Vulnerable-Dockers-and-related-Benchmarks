    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116116 is a vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter (the core PDF and PostScript processing engine). The flaw lies in the handling of *ephemeral* (transient) PostScript procedures inside the interpreter. When Ghostscript processes a crafted PDF, PostScript, or other input file that defines such procedures, it can be tricked into executing code paths that are supposed to be inaccessible. This bypasses the built\u2011in `-dSAFER` sandbox and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process (often root when invoked by system services such as print\u2011spoolers, image\u2011conversion daemons, or web applications). The vulnerability is present in every Ghostscript release up to and including version 9.26; it was fixed in version 9.27. Exploitation requires only the ability to supply a malicious document to a service that invokes Ghostscript, making the flaw highly exploitable in a wide range of environments that rely on Ghostscript for PDF/PS handling.",
