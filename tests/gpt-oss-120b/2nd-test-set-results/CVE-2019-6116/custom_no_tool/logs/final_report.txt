----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2019‑6116 is a vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter (the core PDF and PostScript processing engine). The flaw lies in the handling of *ephemeral* (transient) PostScript procedures inside the interpreter. When Ghostscript processes a crafted PDF, PostScript, or other input file that defines such procedures, it can be tricked into executing code paths that are supposed to be inaccessible. This bypasses the built‑in `-dSAFER` sandbox and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process (often root when invoked by system services such as print‑spoolers, image‑conversion daemons, or web applications). The vulnerability is present in every Ghostscript release up to and including version 9.26; it was fixed in version 9.27. Exploitation requires only the ability to supply a malicious document to a service that invokes Ghostscript, making the flaw highly exploitable in a wide range of environments that rely on Ghostscript for PDF/PS handling.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but the exploit script inside it fails: the log shows '/exploit.sh: line 8: docker: not found', meaning the Docker CLI is not available in the container. This prevents the intended exploit from executing correctly, indicating the container is not functioning as expected.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running, but the exploit script inside it fails: the log shows '/exploit.sh: line 8: docker: not found', meaning the Docker CLI is not available in the container. This prevents the intended exploit from executing correctly, indicating the container is not functioning as expected.
	- FIX: Add the Docker CLI to the image so the script can talk to the host socket. In the Dockerfile replace the single‑line package install with something like `RUN apk add --no-cache curl docker-cli` (or use a base image such as `docker:stable-alpine` that already contains the client). After installing the `docker` binary the existing `exploit.sh` will be able to run `docker ps` through the mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` and the container will behave as intended.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image is based on alpine:3.10 and only installs curl and docker-cli. No ghostscript/ghostscript package is installed, so the image does not use the required service, making the 'services_ok' milestone fail. Consequently, there is no version of ghostscript present, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails (the image does not use a vulnerable ghostscript version).
	- ERROR: The Docker image is based on alpine:3.10 and only installs curl and docker-cli. No ghostscript/ghostscript package is installed, so the image does not use the required service, making the 'services_ok' milestone fail. Consequently, there is no version of ghostscript present, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails (the image does not use a vulnerable ghostscript version).
	- FIX: To make the image satisfy the services_ok milestone, add the vulnerable Ghostscript package to the build so the interpreter is present, and then install a specific version (≤ 9.26) that triggers the code_hard_version check; for example, replace the Dockerfile’s apk add line with apk add --no-cache ghostscript=9.26-r0 curl docker-cli or, if the Alpine repository only provides newer releases, download the 9.26 tarball from the Ghostscript archive, verify its checksum, and install it manually. After Ghostscript is available in the container, the exploit script can invoke gs with a crafted payload to demonstrate the CVE, and the compose file can remain unchanged because the service now exists. This short change ensures both the required service and the vulnerable version are present.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the Alpine 3.10 repository no longer contains the exact “ghostscript=9.25‑r0” package (and the “docker-cli” name may not match the package in that repo), so apk cannot resolve those dependencies. To fix it, change the Dockerfile to install ghostscript without pinning the version (or bump the base image to a newer Alpine release that still provides 9.25) and install the Docker client using the correct package name (for example `docker` or `docker-cli` from the community repository). A minimal change looks like:

```
FROM alpine:3.12
RUN apk add --no-cache ghostscript curl docker
COPY exploit.sh /exploit.sh
RUN chmod +x /exploit.sh
CMD ["sh","/exploit.sh"]
```

Updating the base image and removing the version constraint lets the build complete successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container logs show an unrecoverable Ghostscript error (stackunderflow) and exit code 1, indicating the exploit process failed despite the container being in a running state.
	- ERROR: The container logs show an unrecoverable Ghostscript error (stackunderflow) and exit code 1, indicating the exploit process failed despite the container being in a running state.
	- FIX: Fix the failure by using a Ghostscript version that is actually vulnerable (for example, pin the package to 9.26 instead of the newer Alpine default) and by removing the ‑dSAFER option that re‑enables the sandbox and causes the stackunderflow. Change the Dockerfile to install a specific Ghostscript 9.26 release (e.g., add apk add --no-cache ghostscript=9.26-r0) and adjust exploit.sh so the gs command is invoked without ‑dSAFER (and with any additional flags required by the proof‑of‑concept, such as ‑dNOPAUSE ‑dBATCH). With the vulnerable binary in place and the sandbox disabled, the crafted payload.ps will be processed correctly and the exploit can proceed.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine 3.12 package repository no longer contains the exact “ghostscript=9.26‑r0” package you’re pinning, and the “docker” meta‑package isn’t provided in that release – you need the client binary from the “docker-cli” package instead. Change the Dockerfile to install the current ghostscript version (simply `apk add --no-cache ghostscript`) and replace `docker` with `docker-cli`. After that, keep the `COPY` and `chmod` steps unchanged; the rest of the compose file can stay the same, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running (State.Running = true), but the primary process (sh /exploit.sh) terminated with an unrecoverable Ghostscript error (exit code 1) as shown in the logs: "GPL Ghostscript 9.52: Unrecoverable error, exit code 1" and the detailed stack trace indicating a stackunderflow. This means the intended exploit did not complete successfully, so the container is not functioning correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running (State.Running = true), but the primary process (sh /exploit.sh) terminated with an unrecoverable Ghostscript error (exit code 1) as shown in the logs: "GPL Ghostscript 9.52: Unrecoverable error, exit code 1" and the detailed stack trace indicating a stackunderflow. This means the intended exploit did not complete successfully, so the container is not functioning correctly.
	- FIX: Fix the problem by installing a Ghostscript version that actually contains the flaw (≤ 9.26) instead of the current 9.52 package and by adjusting the payload so it supplies the operands the interpreter expects. In the Dockerfile replace the generic “apk add --no-cache ghostscript” line with a version‑pinned command such as “apk add --no-cache ghostscript=9.26-r0” (or use a custom image that bundles 9.26), then rewrite the `/tmp/payload.ps` to push a dummy argument before calling the transient procedure, for example:

```
%!PS
/ephemeralProc { pop } bind def
(placeholder) ephemeralProc
```

Running Ghostscript with the same flags against this corrected payload on the vulnerable Ghostscript build will avoid the stack‑underflow error and let the exploit proceed.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the Ghostscript source archive isn’t being fetched – the URL in the Dockerfile is malformed (the release tarball is called `ghostscript‑9.26.tar.gz` and lives under `gs9.26/ghostscript-9.26.tar.gz`, not under the duplicated `gs${GHOSTSCRIPT_VERSION}gs${GHOSTSCRIPT_VERSION}a` path). Fix the `curl` line to point to the real download URL, drop the unnecessary `libpaper-dev` package (Alpine’s repository doesn’t have it and it isn’t needed to compile Ghostscript), and keep the rest of the build steps unchanged; after correcting the URL and removing the nonexistent package the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install the Docker client after it has already removed the packages that provide it (the `apk del build‑base curl tar` line runs before `apk add --no-cache docker-cli`). In Alpine 3.12 the client is provided by the `docker` package, not `docker-cli`, so the install command can’t find the requested package. Move the Docker‑client installation **before** the `apk del …` line and change the package name to `docker`. After that, the rest of the steps (download, compile, and install Ghostscript) will succeed and the container will start the exploit script as intended.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Ghostscript configure step needs a few extra packages that aren’t being installed – most notably perl (required by the configure script) and the Docker client package name on Alpine is docker-cli rather than just docker. To fix it, modify the first apk add line in the Dockerfile to include perl and replace docker with docker-cli (or remove the Docker client entirely if it isn’t required for the exploit), then keep the clean‑up step the same. After adding those packages the configure, make and install steps complete successfully and the image builds without error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
