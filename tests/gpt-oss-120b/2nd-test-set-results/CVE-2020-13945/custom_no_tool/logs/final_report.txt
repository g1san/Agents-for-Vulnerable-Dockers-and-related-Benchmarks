CVE description: CVE‑2020‑13945 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache APISIX API gateway. The flaw resides in the Admin API when the default administrative token is left unchanged and the IP‑restriction rule protecting the Admin API is removed. An unauthenticated attacker who knows the hard‑coded default token can call any Admin API endpoint, create or modify routes that contain malicious Lua scripts, and thereby execute arbitrary operating‑system commands on the host running APISIX. This gives the attacker full control over the gateway and any downstream services.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/apisix][['1.2.0', '1.2.1', '1.2.2', '1.2.3', '1.2.4', '1.2.5', '1.2.6', '1.2.7', '1.3.0', '1.3.1', '1.3.2', '1.3.3', '1.3.4', '1.3.5', '1.3.6', '1.4.0', '1.4.1', '1.4.2', '1.4.3', '1.4.4', '1.5.0', '1.5.1', '1.5.2', '1.5.3', '1.5.4']] Core vulnerable component; the Admin API token bypass and Lua script injection occur within this service.
- [SOFT-DB][bitnami/etcd][['3.5.0']] Key‑value store required by Apache APISIX for configuration persistence; needed for the Docker composition to run APISIX.
- [SOFT][alpine][['3.16']] Lightweight base image used to run the APISIX container when building a custom image; ensures the Docker environment functions correctly.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile builds from the base image 'python:3.8-slim', which is neither 'apache/apisix', 'bitnami/etcd' nor 'alpine'. Consequently no hard‑coded services from the provided list are used, and therefore no vulnerable versions of 'apache/apisix' are present. Since the required services are absent, both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones are not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile builds from the base image 'python:3.8-slim', which is neither 'apache/apisix', 'bitnami/etcd' nor 'alpine'. Consequently no hard‑coded services from the provided list are used, and therefore no vulnerable versions of 'apache/apisix' are present. Since the required services are absent, both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones are not satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required milestones you need to replace the current Python‑based image with a stack that actually runs Apache APISIX and its etcd backend. Change the Dockerfile to use the official apache/apisix image (or build one from apache/apisix on the proper Alpine base), add a separate service in the compose file for bitnami/etcd with the 3.5.0 tag, and configure the APISIX service to point at that etcd container. Finally, generate a unique admin token and keep the IP‑restriction rule enabled so the default token cannot be abused; with these changes the composition contains the hard‑coded vulnerable components and the “code_hard_version” and “services_ok” criteria will be met.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because the host‑side config file can’t be found at the path you mounted, so Docker aborts when it tries to bind‑mount ./apisix/conf/config.yaml into the container; make sure the directory hierarchy (the apisix/conf folder with config.yaml) exists relative to the compose file’s location or replace the relative path with an absolute one that points to a real file, and remove the “:ro” flag if the container needs write access to the config directory. Once the mount point is valid the services will start without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to mount a configuration file that isn’t reachable from the directory where the compose is executed, so the container startup aborts with a volume‑mount error. Move the apisix/conf directory so that it sits next to the docker‑compose.yml (or change the bind‑mount to the correct absolute path on the host) and make sure the config.yaml file is present there. While you’re at it, simplify the admin‑API settings: either drop APISIX_ADMIN_API_ALLOW or set it to a proper CIDR (for example 0.0.0.0/0) and keep APISIX_ADMIN_API_IP_RESTRICTION as “false” if you want unrestricted access. After correcting the mount path and aligning the admin‑API environment variables with the values in config.yaml, the services will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file mounts a directory that does not exist relative to the compose location – the path `./apisix/conf` points to a folder that is actually two levels up in the repository tree, so Docker cannot bind‑mount it. Change the volume definition to the correct relative path (for example `../../dockers/CVE-2020-13945/custom_no_tool/apisix/conf:/usr/local/apisix/conf`) or move the compose file into the same directory as the `apisix/conf` folder so the mount resolves. While you are updating the file, also make the admin‑key and IP‑restriction settings consistent by using the same token in both the environment variables and `config.yaml` and set `APISIX_ADMIN_API_IP_RESTRICTION=false` without quotes to avoid type‑mismatch errors. After correcting the bind‑mount path and ensuring the environment variables match the configuration file, the services start normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the host‑side configuration directory that you mount into the APISIX container does not exist at the relative path you specified, so Docker cannot create the bind‑mount and aborts the start‑up. Create the directory (for example `mkdir -p ./dockers/CVE-2020-13945/custom_no_tool/apisix/conf` relative to the compose file) or change the volume line to point to a path that actually exists on the host, and the services will start normally. Once the bind‑mount is fixed, the environment variables you set (including the custom admin token and the disabled IP‑restriction) will be applied without further changes.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the container cannot find the configuration directory you are trying to mount – the relative path `./apisix/conf` does not exist (or is not populated) at build time, so APISIX starts without a valid `config.yaml` and aborts. Create the `apisix/conf` folder next to the `docker‑compose.yml`, copy the supplied `config.yaml` into it (so the file structure is `apisix/conf/config.yaml`), and make sure the folder is readable by the container (adjust permissions if necessary). After the directory and file are in place the volume mount will succeed and the services will start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The container failure is caused by the bind‑mount pointing at a directory that doesn’t exist (or isn’t reachable) from the compose file’s location, so APISIX can’t read its config.yaml when it starts. Create the missing “apisix/conf” directory next to docker‑compose.yml (or adjust the volume line to use an absolute path such as ${PWD}/apisix/conf) and make sure the config.yaml file is inside it with readable permissions. Also change the APISIX_ADMIN_API_IP_RESTRICTION environment value to a quoted string (“false”) so Docker passes it correctly to the container. After those adjustments the compose should bring up etcd and APISIX without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the host‑side volume mount points to a non‑existent directory – `${PWD}` is expanded only when the file is executed from the directory that contains the `apisix/conf` folder, and Docker Compose does not resolve it when the file lives in a different path. Change the volume line to use a path that is guaranteed to exist relative to the compose file, for example `./apisix/conf:/usr/local/apisix/conf`. While you’re editing the file, also make sure the admin‑API settings match: remove the unsupported `enable_admin_api_control` key from `config.yaml` (the admin key is already read from the `admin_key` list) and set `APISIX_ADMIN_API_IP_RESTRICTION` to `false` without quotes so the environment variable is parsed correctly. After these adjustments the services start without the image‑build‑time error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file itself isn’t building any custom images, it only pulls the bitnami/etcd and apache/apisix images, so the failure is almost certainly coming from the bind‑mount of the configuration directory. Make sure that the directory ./apisix/conf (relative to the location of docker‑compose.yml) actually exists on the host and contains a valid config.yaml file (the .keep file alone is not enough). If the directory is missing Docker will abort with a “mount source does not exist” error. Create the folder structure (e.g. `mkdir -p ./apisix/conf && cp config.yaml ./apisix/conf/`), verify the YAML syntax, and then run `docker compose up` again. Once the host path is present the services will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
