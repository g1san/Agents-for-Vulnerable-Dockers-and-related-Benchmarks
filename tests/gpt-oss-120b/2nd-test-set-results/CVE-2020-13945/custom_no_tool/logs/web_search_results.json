    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201113945 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache APISIX API gateway. The flaw resides in the Admin API when the default administrative token is left unchanged and the IP\u2011restriction rule protecting the Admin API is removed. An unauthenticated attacker who knows the hard\u2011coded default token can call any Admin API endpoint, create or modify routes that contain malicious Lua scripts, and thereby execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host running APISIX. This gives the attacker full control over the gateway and any downstream services.",
