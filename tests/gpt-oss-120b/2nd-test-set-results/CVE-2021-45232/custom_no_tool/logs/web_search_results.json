    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201145232 is a critical vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard, the web\u2011based management user interface for the APISIX API gateway. The dashboard mixes two Go web frameworks \u2013 gin and droplet \u2013 and the authentication middleware is only applied to routes handled by droplet. Several manager API endpoints are still routed directly through gin, which bypasses the authentication check entirely. An unauthenticated attacker can therefore send crafted HTTP requests to these unprotected endpoints, invoke privileged manager operations, and submit arbitrary Lua scripts that are executed by the dashboard process. Because the dashboard runs with the same privileges as the APISIX service, the attacker can execute operating\u2011system commands on the host, achieving full remote code execution. The flaw affects all dashboard releases prior to version 2.10.1 (including the 2.7, 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10 series). Exploitation requires only network access to the dashboard HTTP interface; no credentials or prior access are needed. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read or modify API configurations, create malicious routes or plugins, and run arbitrary commands on the server.",
