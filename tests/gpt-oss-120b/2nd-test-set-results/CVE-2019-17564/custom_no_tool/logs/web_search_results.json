    "desc": "Apache Dubbo\u2019s optional HTTP protocol handler deserializes the raw request body using Java ObjectInputStream without any validation. When Dubbo is configured with the HTTP protocol enabled, an attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request containing a malicious serialized Java object (for example a Commons\u2011Collections4 gadget chain generated with ysoserial). The vulnerable deserializer reads and instantiates the object, executing arbitrary code on the server process. This flaw affects all Dubbo releases that support the HTTP protocol in the 2.5.x line and in the 2.6.x and 2.7.x lines up to the versions where the issue was patched (2.7.5 and later). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution with the privileges of the Dubbo process.",
