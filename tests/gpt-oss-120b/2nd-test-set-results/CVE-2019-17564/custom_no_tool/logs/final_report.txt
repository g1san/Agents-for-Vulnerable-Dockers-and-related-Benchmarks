CVE description: Apache Dubbo’s optional HTTP protocol handler deserializes the raw request body using Java ObjectInputStream without any validation. When Dubbo is configured with the HTTP protocol enabled, an attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request containing a malicious serialized Java object (for example a Commons‑Collections4 gadget chain generated with ysoserial). The vulnerable deserializer reads and instantiates the object, executing arbitrary code on the server process. This flaw affects all Dubbo releases that support the HTTP protocol in the 2.5.x line and in the 2.6.x and 2.7.x lines up to the versions where the issue was patched (2.7.5 and later). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution with the privileges of the Dubbo process.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: First, ensure the LDAP server the application expects is actually running; if you don’t need the vulnerable endpoint, either start a mock LDAP container on port 1389 or comment out the entire /app/server.js search route and remove the ldapjs dependency from package.json. Next, verify the MySQL service is healthy before the Node container tries to connect: add a small wait‑script (for example using docker‑entrypoint‑wait) or change the compose file to include restart: unless‑stopped for the webapp and set depends_on: { db: { condition: service_healthy } } together with a healthcheck on the MySQL container. Finally, rebuild the image after updating the Dockerfile (run docker compose build or docker compose up --build) and then bring the stack up again; the webapp should start without hanging on the missing LDAP service or a premature DB connection.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the node:10‑alpine image doesn’t contain the compilers and Python runtime needed to compile the native mysql module, so npm install crashes; switching to a current Node image that already includes build tools (or installing them yourself) solves the problem. Change the first line of the Dockerfile to something like FROM node:18‑alpine or, if you must stay on Node 10, add a RUN apk add --no‑cache python3 make g++ before the npm install step, then rebuild—this gives the compiler chain the dependencies it needs and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the Alpine‑based Node container does not have the libraries required to compile the native modules pulled in by the old ldapjs 1.0.0 package, so the `npm install` step aborts. To fix it, modify the Dockerfile to install the additional Alpine packages that provide the needed headers (for example `libc6-compat` and `openssl-dev`) before running `npm install`, and run the install with `--unsafe-perm` to allow the build scripts to run as root. Updating the ldapjs dependency to a newer version that does not need those native bindings (or switching to a pure‑JavaScript LDAP client) also eliminates the compilation step entirely, letting the image build successfully. After adding the required packages or upgrading the dependency, the rest of the Docker‑Compose stack—MySQL health‑check and the OpenLDAP container—starts normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the native dependencies required by the old ldapjs 1.0.0 version cannot be compiled with the current Alpine toolchain – the “g++” package isn’t available under that name and the old ldapjs won’t link against the newer libc‑musl environment. Change the Dockerfile to install the full Alpine build base (e.g. apk add --no-cache python3 make gcc g++ libc6-compat openssl-dev) or, better yet, upgrade the ldapjs dependency in package.json to a recent 2.x release that ships pre‑built binaries for Node 18, then rebuild with npm ci instead of npm install. After these adjustments the Docker‑compose stack should start without the image‑build error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Node image does not provide the libraries needed by the native modules required by ldapjs (and the MySQL client), so the npm install step aborts while compiling. Switch the base image to a non‑Alpine Debian‑based variant (for example `FROM node:18-slim`), replace the `apk` commands with the corresponding `apt‑get` install of the build tools (`build-essential`, `python3`, `make`, `g++`, `libssl-dev`), and then run `npm ci` (or `npm install`) as before. Removing the Alpine‑specific `libc6-compat` line and using the Debian packages ensures the native extensions compile successfully, allowing the Docker image to build without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Node 18‑slim base doesn’t contain the tools that some of the npm modules need to compile (git for pulling source, and a full Python 3 environment plus the C tool‑chain), so the `npm install` step aborts. Fix it by extending the Dockerfile’s apt line to install `git` (and, if you prefer, the `python3‑distutils` package) together with the existing build‑essential packages, then clean the apt cache; after that the `npm install --unsafe‑perm` step will succeed and the rest of the image can be built normally. In practice the change looks like adding `git` to the `apt‑get install` list (e.g. `apt‑get install -y --no-install-recommends git build‑essential python3 make g++ libssl-dev`) and keeping the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the Node‑gyp toolchain that npm invokes expects a “python” executable and a few development libraries that aren’t present in the slim base; fixing it is as simple as installing the missing binary and its dependencies before running npm. In the Dockerfile replace the apt‑install line with one that adds the generic “python3” package and creates a symlink called “python” (so node‑gyp can find it), and also install the C library headers required by native modules (e.g., libldap2-dev, libssl-dev, make, g++). A minimal fix looks like this:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git python3 make g++ libssl-dev libldap2-dev && \
    ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --unsafe-perm
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node","server.js"]
```

Adding the python symlink and the required dev libraries lets npm complete its build, after which the compose stack starts normally.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the node:18‑slim image doesn’t contain everything the native LDAP and MySQL bindings need to compile – in particular the C‑LDAP development headers (libldap2‑dev) and a Python interpreter that node‑gyp recognises. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile so the apt‑install line adds the required LDAP libraries (e.g. libsasl2‑dev and libssl‑dev are already there, just keep libldap2‑dev) and creates a “python” alias that points to python3 before running npm install. A minimal change would be:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        git python3 make g++ libssl-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev && \
    ln -sf /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

With the needed headers present and the python symlink in place, npm install will succeed and the image will build correctly. No other code changes are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the native modules (ldapjs, mysql) need a Python interpreter that node‑gyp can invoke, and the slim Node image only provides Python 3 while node‑gyp still expects the binary named python (or Python 2). Fix the Dockerfile by installing the legacy python package (or explicitly adding a python‑2 interpreter) and then linking the generic python name to it before running npm. For example, change the RUN line to install `python2` (or `python-is-python2` on Debian‑based images) and add a symlink `ln -sf /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python` before the `npm install`. After that the image builds successfully.
