-- Sample init script for MySQL (no tables needed for Drupal auto‑install)
-- This file ensures the DB container runs the init script mechanism.
-- No pre‑populated data is required; Drupal will create its own schema on first run.

-- Optional test data (a minimal user record) can be added here if desired if desired.
