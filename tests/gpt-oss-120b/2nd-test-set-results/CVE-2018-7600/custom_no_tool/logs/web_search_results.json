    "desc": "CVE-2018-7600, also known as Drupalgeddon 2, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Drupal content\u2011management system. The flaw resides in Drupal's Form API handling of renderable arrays. When an unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted AJAX request containing form\u2011render array keys that begin with \"#\" (such as #post_render, #pre_render, #access_callback, or #lazy_builder), the input is processed without proper sanitisation. This allows the attacker to inject malicious PHP code that is executed during the rendering phase of the request. Exploits typically target default forms like \"/user/register\" (Drupal 8) or \"/user/password\" (Drupal 7) and can execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the web\u2011server process, leading to full site takeover, web\u2011shell upload, ransomware deployment, or use of the host for further attacks. The vulnerability affects Drupal core versions prior to the patched releases: Drupal 7.x < 7.58, Drupal 8.3.x < 8.3.9, Drupal 8.4.x < 8.4.6, and Drupal 8.5.x < 8.5.1. No additional services are required beyond the vulnerable Drupal web application itself.",
