----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2018-7600, also known as Drupalgeddon 2, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Drupal content‑management system. The flaw resides in Drupal's Form API handling of renderable arrays. When an unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted AJAX request containing form‑render array keys that begin with "#" (such as #post_render, #pre_render, #access_callback, or #lazy_builder), the input is processed without proper sanitisation. This allows the attacker to inject malicious PHP code that is executed during the rendering phase of the request. Exploits typically target default forms like "/user/register" (Drupal 8) or "/user/password" (Drupal 7) and can execute arbitrary operating‑system commands with the privileges of the web‑server process, leading to full site takeover, web‑shell upload, ransomware deployment, or use of the host for further attacks. The vulnerability affects Drupal core versions prior to the patched releases: Drupal 7.x < 7.58, Drupal 8.3.x < 8.3.9, Drupal 8.4.x < 8.4.6, and Drupal 8.5.x < 8.5.1. No additional services are required beyond the vulnerable Drupal web application itself.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Drupal‑based image doesn’t contain the MySQL client utilities that the entrypoint script uses to poll the database; when the script runs `mysqladmin ping` it can’t find the binary and aborts. To fix it, add the MySQL client package to the image (for example, `apt-get install -y default-mysql-client` or `mysql-client`) in the same `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install …` line that already adds curl, git and unzip. After installing the client, rebuild the image and the container will start correctly, allowing the rest of the entrypoint logic (Drush site install) to execute.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails to build because the base tag you reference doesn’t exist (or points to a patched version) – `drupal:7.58‑apache` is either missing from Docker Hub or already includes the fix for CVE‑2018‑7600, so the build can’t find a matching layer. Change the `FROM` line to a tag that actually exists and contains the vulnerable code, for example `FROM drupal:7.57‑apache` (or simply `FROM drupal:7‑apache` and then pin the exact vulnerable revision later). After that, the rest of the Dockerfile will run unchanged and the container will start correctly. (Optionally, replace the `$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` fallback in the entrypoint with `$DRUPAL_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` or set `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in the drupal service’s environment so the readiness loop succeeds.)


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base Drupal image doesn’t include the MySQL client binary that mysqladmin expects and it also lacks a PHP‑CLI interpreter needed to run Drush; updating the Dockerfile to install the proper packages fixes the problem. Replace the line that installs default‑mysql‑client with mysql‑client (and add php‑cli so Drush can execute), then rebuild the image; the entrypoint script will be able to ping MySQL and invoke Drush without errors. After this change the image builds successfully and the container starts as intended.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the entrypoint script tries to ping MySQL with MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, a variable that is never defined for the drupal container – only DRUPAL_DB_USER and DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD exist – so the `mysqladmin` command aborts and the container exits before the site can be installed. Fix it by either adding `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass` to the drupal service’s environment block (mirroring the password used for the root account in the db container) or, better, modify the entrypoint to use the Drupal‑specific credentials (`DRUPAL_DB_USER`/`DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD`) when running `mysqladmin ping`. After that change the image builds and starts correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base Drupal image is based on the very old Debian Jessie archive and the `apt` sources you add cause the package manager to error out before it can install the extra tools. Fix it by simplifying the repository setup: keep only the archived `jessie` line, set `Acquire::Check-Valid-Until "false"` in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-check-valid`, and force a non‑interactive install. Add `apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` after the install step so the layer finishes cleanly. Also make the entrypoint script executable and ensure it ends with `exec "$@"` (which you already have). In practice the Dockerfile should install the needed packages in a single `RUN` line, like:

```dockerfile
RUN set -eux; \
    echo "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list; \
    echo 'Acquire::Check-Valid-Until "false";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-check-valid; \
    apt-get update; \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        curl git unzip php-cli php-mysql default-mysql-client; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

With the repository lines corrected and the package install forced to be non‑interactive, the image builds successfully and the container can start the Drupal site as intended.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to reinstall PHP 5 packages on the drupal:7.57‑apache image, which already contains a working PHP interpreter and for which the php5‑cli/php5‑mysql packages are no longer available in the Jessie archive; the apt step therefore aborts. To fix it, remove the “php5‑cli php5‑mysql” entries from the apt‑get install line (or replace them with the appropriate PHP 7 packages that match the base image), and add “ca‑certificates” so that the later curl download of Drush can succeed. After these changes the image builds cleanly and the entrypoint can run the Drupal installation as intended.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base image you’re pulling ( drupal:7.57‑apache ) no longer exists in Docker Hub and the old Debian “jessie” repository you point to is now unavailable, causing the `apt‑get update` step to error out. Replace the base line with a currently‑supported tag such as `FROM drupal:7-apache` (or the exact version that is still published), and drop the custom `sources.list` and `apt.conf.d/99no-check-valid` lines – the default Debian repositories that come with the newer image are still reachable, so a simple `apt‑get update && apt‑get install …` will succeed. After updating the FROM line (and optionally adjusting the MySQL client package name if needed), the rest of the Dockerfile and entrypoint script can stay unchanged and the image will build without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base image tag `drupal:7.57‑apache` does not exist in the official registry; you need to switch to a valid tag such as `drupal:7-apache` (or pull the exact 7.57 version from the `drupal:7.57` manifest and let Apache be added later). After changing the `FROM` line to a real image, update the Drush download command to follow redirects (`curl -L …`) and verify the URL points to an existing release (for example `https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases/download/8.4.8/drush.phar`). Finally, run `apt-get clean` after installing packages to keep the layer size small. With those adjustments the Dockerfile builds without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the drush binary needs a PHP CLI interpreter, which isn’t present in the default drupal:7‑apache image; installing php-cli (and any required extensions) in the same RUN step that installs the other utilities resolves the problem, and then the entrypoint can be copied and marked executable as usual. In practice you’d change the Dockerfile to add php-cli (and, for example, php-mbstring and php-xml if drush requires them) to the apt‑get install line, keep the rest of the steps unchanged, and then rebuild the image. This guarantees the drush command runs correctly during the entrypoint’s site‑install phase and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
