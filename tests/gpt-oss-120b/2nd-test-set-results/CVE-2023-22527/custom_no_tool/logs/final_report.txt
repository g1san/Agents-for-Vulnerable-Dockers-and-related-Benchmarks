CVE description: CVE‑2023‑22527 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data‑Center. The flaw is a template‑injection issue where specially crafted request parameters are processed by the Velocity rendering engine without proper sanitisation. An attacker can send a malicious payload to the `/template/aui/text-inline.vm` endpoint (or similar) that injects OGNL/FreeMarker code, which is then executed by the server process, allowing arbitrary operating‑system commands to run with the privileges of the Confluence service. The vulnerability affects Confluence Server and Data‑Center versions released before 5 December 2023, specifically the 8.0.x, 8.1.x, 8.2.x, 8.3.x, 8.4.x series and the 8.5.0‑8.5.3 releases. No authentication or user interaction is required to exploit the flaw, making it extremely dangerous. The vulnerability was fixed in Confluence 8.5.4 (LTS) and later releases (8.6.0, 8.7.1, 8.7.2).

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The testapp container fails because it tries to bind‑mount a host file that doesn’t exist and it isn’t privileged, so the Docker daemon refuses the mount and the container never starts; change the compose file to give testapp privileged access (add `privileged: true`) and create the host path beforehand (for example, add a bind‑mount of a writable host directory such as `./host:/host` and adjust the bind in the API call to `"/host:/host"`), and replace the fixed five‑second sleep with a short loop that polls `http://docker:2375/_ping` until it returns “OK” before issuing any API requests. This ensures the Docker daemon is ready, the mount is allowed, and the container can start and write the file as intended.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The testapp’s API call creates a child container that binds to /host, but the Docker‑in‑Docker service itself never mounts the host directory, so the bind mount points to a non‑existent path inside the dind container and the write fails. Add the same bind‑mount to the docker service (e.g. ‑ ./host:/host) so that the path exists inside the daemon’s filesystem, and then the child container can write to /host/exploit.txt as intended. After adding the volume to the docker service and redeploying, the container will start correctly and the exploit file will be created.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The testapp container is trying to call the Docker API before the dind daemon inside the docker service is fully up, so the request to http://docker:2375/_ping fails and the script exits. Add a health‑check to the docker service that probes the /_ping endpoint and change the depends_on definition for testapp to wait for the service to become healthy (e.g. depends_on: docker: {condition: service_healthy}). This guarantees the daemon is ready before the exploit script runs, eliminating the “Docker daemon not reachable” error and allowing the container to start and write /host/exploit.txt as intended.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The Compose file’s health‑check for the docker‑in‑docker service is the likely cause of the failure – the `docker:20.10.13-dind` image does not include the curl binary, so the `curl -f http://localhost:2375/_ping` command never succeeds and the service stays unhealthy, preventing the dependent testapp from being built. Fix it by either installing curl in the DIND container (e.g., by overriding the image or adding a small init script that runs `apk add --no-cache curl`) or by changing the health‑check to use a command that already exists in the image, such as `docker info` or `wget`. Once the health‑check can succeed, the testapp service will start and the build will complete without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Docker‑in‑Docker service is starting the daemon only on the default Unix socket, so the testapp cannot reach it at tcp://docker:2375; modify the docker service in docker‑compose.yml to launch the daemon with a TCP listener by adding a command: ["dockerd-entrypoint.sh","--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","--storage-driver=vfs"] (or the appropriate flags for your environment). Optionally remove the privileged: true setting if it isn’t required and add a bind‑mount for /var/lib/docker to persist the daemon’s state. After rebuilding with the updated compose file, the healthcheck will pass and the exploit script will be able to communicate with the Docker daemon.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The core issue is that the test container tries to bind‑mount “/host” inside the Docker‑in‑Docker daemon, but the volume is defined only as a Docker named volume (host_data) and isn’t available at the literal path “/host” on the host filesystem, so the bind fails and the container can’t write the exploit file. Change the bind definition in exploit.py to use the named volume (e.g., `"Binds": ["host_data:/host"]`) or mount the host directory explicitly in the compose file (e.g., `- /absolute/path/to/host:/host`). After updating the bind target, the testapp will be able to start the Alpine container and create /host/exploit.txt as intended. If the daemon still isn’t reachable, increase the health‑check timeout or add a short sleep before the first API call to give the Docker service time to initialize.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The testapp container is mounting a named volume (`host_data`) while the exploit script expects a bind‑mounted directory at `/host`; because the two mounts point to different locations the container can’t write to the host path and the exploit never creates `/host/exploit.txt`. Change the `testapp` service to bind‑mount the same host directory that the Docker daemon uses, for example replace the `volumes:` line with `- ./host:/host`, and keep the `HostConfig` bind (`/host:/host`) unchanged. After that the testapp will see the exact `/host` path the daemon exposes, the container will start, write the file, and the service should become healthy. If the Docker daemon still fails to start, verify that the host directory `./host` exists and is writable, and that the privileged flag and `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` are correctly set.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that isn’t starting is likely failing because the bind‑mount “./host:/host” points at a path that doesn’t exist on the host or isn’t shared through a Docker‑managed volume, causing the daemon to abort when it tries to start the privileged Docker‑in‑Docker service. Change the compose file so both the docker and testapp services use the named volume host_data instead of the relative path, e.g. replace ‑ ./host:/host with ‑ host_data:/host and remove the unused host_data definition under volumes if it isn’t needed elsewhere. After the volume is correctly declared and mounted, restart the stack and the services should come up without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the Docker‑in‑Docker service never becomes healthy, so the testapp container never starts; the most common cause is that the daemon cannot write its state because no persistent `/var/lib/docker` directory is mounted and the default `vfs` driver isn’t usable without the proper filesystem support. Fix it by adding a bind‑mount (or named volume) for `/var/lib/docker` to the docker service and switching the storage driver to one that works on the host kernel (e.g., `overlay2`). In the compose file change the docker service definition to include:

```yaml
volumes:
  - docker_data:/var/lib/docker
  - host_data:/host
```

and update the command line to `--storage-driver=overlay2`. Then declare the new volume at the bottom:

```yaml
volumes:
  host_data:
  pg_data:
  docker_data:
```

After restarting the stack the healthcheck will succeed, allowing the testapp container to run and create `/host/exploit.txt` as intended. (No other code changes are required.)


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
