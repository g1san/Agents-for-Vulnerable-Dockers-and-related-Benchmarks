    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201125646 is a vulnerability in Apache Druid that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server. Apache Druid includes a feature that can evaluate user\u2011supplied JavaScript code as part of certain request payloads (for example, the \\`transformSpec.filter\\` field in the /druid/indexer/v1/sampler endpoint). In versions prior to 0.20.1 the safeguard that disables this capability by default can be bypassed. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request containing a JavaScript filter that calls \\`java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)\\`. The Java runtime executes the supplied command with the same privileges as the Druid process, resulting in remote code execution. Because the vulnerable endpoint is exposed over HTTP, the attack can be performed remotely without needing local access. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control of the host running the Druid service, allowing actions such as opening a reverse shell, reading or modifying data, and installing additional malware.",
