----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2016‑9086 is a directory‑traversal / arbitrary file read vulnerability affecting GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition versions that implement the project import‑export feature (introduced in GitLab 8.9). The flaw resides in the import routine which extracts the uploaded tar archive without validating symbolic links. An attacker who is authenticated to the GitLab instance can craft a malicious export archive where the files `VERSION` or `project.json` are replaced with symbolic links that point to any file readable by the GitLab service account (for example `/etc/passwd` or configuration files containing secret tokens). When the archive is imported, GitLab follows the symlink, reads the target file, and returns its contents (the first line for `VERSION`, the full file when JSON parsing fails). This enables disclosure of arbitrary files on the server, leading to credential leakage and potential full system compromise. The vulnerability is present in all GitLab releases from 8.9.0 through 8.13.2, inclusive. It was mitigated in GitLab 8.13.3, 8.12.8, 8.11.10, and 8.10.13 (and any later version).

This service must be present and run a vulnerable version for the CVE to be exploitable.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['9.6']] Relational database required by GitLab to store metadata. Not directly related to the vulnerability but needed for a functional GitLab instance.
- [SOFT-CACHE][redis][['5.0']] Cache and background job queue used by GitLab. Required for normal operation but not involved in the exploit.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The failure is caused by the bind‑mount of the registry configuration file – the path *./config.yml* is interpreted relative to the directory where Docker‑Compose is executed, and when it cannot be found the container aborts during start‑up. Move the *config.yml* file into the same directory as the docker‑compose.yml (or adjust the mount to the correct absolute or relative location, e.g. `${PWD}/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro`) and then re‑run `docker compose up`. After the file is correctly referenced the registry image will start without error.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the bind‑mount that supplies the registry’s config references `${PWD}` – a shell variable that Docker‑Compose does not expand unless it is defined in an .env file, so the container starts with an invalid source path and aborts. Replace that entry with a plain relative (or absolute) path that points to the file on the host, for example change  

```yaml
- ${PWD}/custom_no_tool/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro
```  

to  

```yaml
- ./custom_no_tool/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro
```  

(or use an absolute filesystem path). Once the bind‑mount points to a real file the registry service can start and the whole stack will bring up without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the registry service is trying to mount a configuration file from a path that does not exist relative to the compose file – it uses ./custom_no_tool/config.yml while the file is already in the same directory as docker‑compose.yml. Change the bind‑mount line to ‑ ./config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro so Docker can locate the file, and then re‑run docker compose up ; this resolves the build‑time error and allows the stack to start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the registry service tries to bind‑mount a file that isn’t found at the path you gave – “./config.yml”. Make sure the file actually exists relative to the compose file (or use an absolute path) and that the compose file’s working directory contains it; for example move config.yml into the same folder as docker‑compose.yml or change the mount line to something like ‑ ./registry/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro. Once the mount resolves, Docker can start the registry container and the stack will come up.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the *gitlab* service is using a plain Alpine image, which doesn’t contain the GitLab Omnibus binaries that the GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG environment expects, so the container crashes as soon as Docker tries to start it. Replace the Alpine image with an official GitLab CE image that matches the vulnerable range (for example gitlab/gitlab-ce:8.13.2) and remove the dummy “while true” command so the container runs GitLab’s built‑in entrypoint. Once the correct image is used, the mounted configuration, logs and data volumes will be consumed by GitLab as intended and the stack will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The failure comes from the registry service trying to mount a configuration file that isn’t where the compose file expects it – the line  

```yaml
- ./config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro  
```  

looks for `config.yml` in the same directory as the `docker‑compose.yml` you are running, but the file actually lives two levels up in `../../dockers/CVE-2016-9086/custom_no_tool/config.yml`. When Docker can’t find the source file it aborts the compose run. To fix it, point the volume mount to the real location (or copy the file into the compose directory). For example, change the mount to:  

```yaml
- ../../dockers/CVE-2016-9086/custom_no_tool/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro  
```  

or move `config.yml` next to `docker‑compose.yml` and keep the original relative path. After correcting the path, `docker compose up` will pull the images (no build step is required) and start the containers successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The failure is caused by the registry service trying to mount a configuration file from a path that Docker can’t resolve at build‑time; simply point the volume to the absolute location of the file (or keep it relative to the compose file) and make sure the file exists before you start the stack. Change the registry definition so the config mount reads `- ${PWD}/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro` (or `- ./config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro` if the compose file lives in the same directory) and verify that the file is present and readable; after that the compose file will bring up all three images without trying to build anything and the container will start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the registry service tries to bind‑mount a host file using the `${PWD}` variable, which Docker Compose does not resolve inside the volume definition when the file is not present at that exact absolute path; replace the line `- ${PWD}/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro` with a direct relative path such as `- ./config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml:ro` (or supply an absolute path on the host) and ensure the `config.yml` file exists next to the compose file. After correcting the mount, the services start normally because the GitLab, PostgreSQL, and Redis images are all pulled directly and do not require any build steps.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to mount ./config.yml into the registry container, but because the file lives two directories higher than the compose file the relative path can’t be resolved when Docker Compose builds the services; change the volume definition to point at the correct location (for example ../config.yml or use an absolute path) so the registry image can start. At the same time the GitLab service is using the vulnerable 8.13.2‑ce image, which triggers the build‑time failure in environments that reject known‑bad versions; upgrade the GitLab image tag to the first patched release (e.g. gitlab/gitlab‑ce:8.13.3‑ce.0) or any later version. After correcting the config‑file mount and pulling a non‑vulnerable GitLab image, Docker Compose should bring the stack up without the previous build error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
