    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20119086 is a directory\u2011traversal / arbitrary file read vulnerability affecting GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition versions that implement the project import\u2011export feature (introduced in GitLab 8.9). The flaw resides in the import routine which extracts the uploaded tar archive without validating symbolic links. An attacker who is authenticated to the GitLab instance can craft a malicious export archive where the files `VERSION` or `project.json` are replaced with symbolic links that point to any file readable by the GitLab service account (for example `/etc/passwd` or configuration files containing secret tokens). When the archive is imported, GitLab follows the symlink, reads the target file, and returns its contents (the first line for `VERSION`, the full file when JSON parsing fails). This enables disclosure of arbitrary files on the server, leading to credential leakage and potential full system compromise. The vulnerability is present in all GitLab releases from 8.9.0 through 8.13.2, inclusive. It was mitigated in GitLab 8.13.3, 8.12.8, 8.11.10, and 8.10.13 (and any later version).",
