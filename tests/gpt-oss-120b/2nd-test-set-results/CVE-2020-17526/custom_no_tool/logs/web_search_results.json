    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201117526 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache Airflow. The Airflow webserver (the Flask\u2011based UI) shipped with a hard\u2011coded default secret_key value (\\\"temporary_key\\\") in the configuration file airflow.cfg. This key is used to sign Flask session cookies. Because the key is static and known, an attacker can capture a legitimate session cookie, decode it, modify the JSON payload to set any desired user identifier (for example the admin user ID), re\u2011sign the payload with the known secret_key, and replay the forged cookie to the vulnerable Airflow instance. The server accepts the forged cookie as authentic and grants the attacker full administrative access to the Airflow UI. With admin privileges the attacker can edit or create malicious DAGs, view or alter stored connections and variables, and execute arbitrary commands on the host or against connected services, potentially leading to full compromise of the underlying cloud environment.",
