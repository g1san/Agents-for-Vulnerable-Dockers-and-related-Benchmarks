CVE description: CVE‑2020‑17526 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache Airflow. The Airflow webserver (the Flask‑based UI) shipped with a hard‑coded default secret_key value (\"temporary_key\") in the configuration file airflow.cfg. This key is used to sign Flask session cookies. Because the key is static and known, an attacker can capture a legitimate session cookie, decode it, modify the JSON payload to set any desired user identifier (for example the admin user ID), re‑sign the payload with the known secret_key, and replay the forged cookie to the vulnerable Airflow instance. The server accepts the forged cookie as authentic and grants the attacker full administrative access to the Airflow UI. With admin privileges the attacker can edit or create malicious DAGs, view or alter stored connections and variables, and execute arbitrary commands on the host or against connected services, potentially leading to full compromise of the underlying cloud environment.
Attack Type: authentication bypass
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/airflow][['1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.10.3', '1.10.4', '1.10.5', '1.10.6', '1.10.7', '1.10.8', '1.10.9', '1.10.10', '1.10.11', '1.10.12', '1.10.13', '1.10.14', '2.0.0', '2.0.1']] Vulnerable Airflow webserver image that contains the default secret_key; this component is required for the authentication bypass to be possible.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13-alpine']] Metadata database used by Airflow to store DAG definitions, user accounts, and session data; required for Airflow to run.
- [SOFT-CACHE][redis][['6-alpine']] Result backend / Celery broker used by Airflow when the Celery executor is selected; needed for a functional Airflow deployment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker Compose configuration defines only two services: 'docker' (using the image docker:19.03.11-dind) and 'vulnerable_app' (built from a custom Python image). No service based on apache/airflow is present, so the code does not use any of the listed vulnerable Airflow versions, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false. Moreover, the required services list ['apache/airflow', 'postgres', 'redis'] is not satisfied—none of these services appear in the compose file—so the 'services_ok' milestone is also false.
	- ERROR: The Docker Compose configuration defines only two services: 'docker' (using the image docker:19.03.11-dind) and 'vulnerable_app' (built from a custom Python image). No service based on apache/airflow is present, so the code does not use any of the listed vulnerable Airflow versions, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false. Moreover, the required services list ['apache/airflow', 'postgres', 'redis'] is not satisfied—none of these services appear in the compose file—so the 'services_ok' milestone is also false.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to extend the compose file so it actually provisions the vulnerable Airflow stack. Add a service using a vulnerable apache/airflow image (for example apache/airflow:1.10.12) and configure it to read the default airflow.cfg that contains the hard‑coded temporary_key secret; mount a simple airflow.cfg into /etc/airflow so the default key is present. Then add a PostgreSQL service (e.g., postgres:13-alpine) and a Redis service (e.g., redis:6-alpine) and set the Airflow executor to CeleryExecutor or LocalExecutor with the appropriate AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN and AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL environment variables pointing to the PostgreSQL and Redis containers. Finally, update the depends_on section of the vulnerable_app service so it waits for the Airflow, PostgreSQL and Redis services, and expose the Airflow web UI port (e.g., 8080 or 5000) to allow testing of the authentication bypass. This brings the required services into the composition and makes the code_hard_version and services_ok milestones true.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker compose does not expose all services on their default ports. The vulnerable_app container runs on port 8080 internally but is mapped to host port 8081, which is not the default. Additionally, the PostgreSQL and Redis services, which default to ports 5432 and 6379 respectively, are not published to the host network at all, preventing external access on their standard ports.
	- ERROR: The Docker compose does not expose all services on their default ports. The vulnerable_app container runs on port 8080 internally but is mapped to host port 8081, which is not the default. Additionally, the PostgreSQL and Redis services, which default to ports 5432 and 6379 respectively, are not published to the host network at all, preventing external access on their standard ports.
	- FIX: To expose the services on their default ports, add host port mappings for PostgreSQL and Redis in the compose file—for example, under the postgres service include `ports: ["5432:5432"]` and under the redis service include `ports: ["6379:6379"]`. Since the vulnerable_app already maps its internal port 8080 to host 8081, you can change the mapping to `ports: ["8080:8080"]` if you want it reachable on the standard port, or leave it as‑is and just note the alternate host port. Updating these `ports` sections ensures each service is reachable on its conventional port from the host.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build itself is fine – the problem shows up when Docker Compose tries to start the stack because the **airflow** service and the **vulnerable_app** service are both publishing host port 8080. When the second service starts Docker reports a port‑binding error and the whole compose run aborts, which looks like a “build” failure.  

Fix it by giving the two web services distinct host ports (for example keep Airflow on 8080 and move the vulnerable app to 5000) and update the `ports:` line under `vulnerable_app` accordingly. After that the images build without conflict and the compose file can launch all containers successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The vulnerable_app service runs a Flask application that listens on the container's default port 8080, but the docker-compose file maps it to host port 5000 ("5000:8080"). This means the service is not exposed on its standard network port, violating the network_setup milestone. All other services (docker, postgres, redis, airflow) correctly map their default ports (2375, 5432, 6379, 8080 respectively).
	- ERROR: The vulnerable_app service runs a Flask application that listens on the container's default port 8080, but the docker-compose file maps it to host port 5000 ("5000:8080"). This means the service is not exposed on its standard network port, violating the network_setup milestone. All other services (docker, postgres, redis, airflow) correctly map their default ports (2375, 5432, 6379, 8080 respectively).
	- FIX: To bring the vulnerable_app service in line with the network_setup milestone, edit its entry in docker‑compose.yml so the container’s native port 8080 is bound to the same port on the host; replace the line ports: - "5000:8080" with ports: - "8080:8080". This change makes the Flask application reachable on its standard port without affecting the rest of the stack.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the airflow service and vulnerable_app service are both trying to bind the host‑side port 8080, which makes Docker abort when it builds or starts the second image; rename one of the exposed ports (for example change vulnerable_app to "8090:8080”) and the conflict disappears. While you’re editing the file, also drop the empty AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY environment line (it isn’t needed) and make sure the airflow.cfg you mount is the one you really want (the secret_key stays “temporary_key” for the demo). After those two small changes the images build and the stack launches without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The vulnerable_app service maps its internal port 8080 to external port 8090 ("8090:8080"), which deviates from the default port it listens on (8080). All other services use their standard ports, but because at least one service is not exposed on its default network port, the overall network_setup milestone is not met.
	- ERROR: The vulnerable_app service maps its internal port 8080 to external port 8090 ("8090:8080"), which deviates from the default port it listens on (8080). All other services use their standard ports, but because at least one service is not exposed on its default network port, the overall network_setup milestone is not met.
	- FIX: To meet the network_setup milestone you need the vulnerable_app service to listen on its default port (8080) from the outside. The simplest fix is to change the port mapping in docker‑compose.yml from "8090:8080" to "8080:8080" so the container’s internal port 8080 is exposed on the host’s port 8080. If you must keep the external port 8090, modify app.py to run on port 8090 (e.g., app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8090)) and then map "8090:8090" in the compose file; this aligns the external exposure with the actual listening port and satisfies the milestone.
