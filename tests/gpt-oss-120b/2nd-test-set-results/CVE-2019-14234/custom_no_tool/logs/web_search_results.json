    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u201114234 is a vulnerability in Django\u2019s Object\u2011relational mapping layer that affects the handling of JSONField and HStoreField (PostgreSQL\u2011only). When a field name is supplied by an attacker in a queryset lookup (for example via a crafted GET parameter like `detail__a'b=123`), Django concatenates the supplied key directly into the generated SQL without proper sanitisation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, leading to SQL injection. The flaw exists in Django 1.11 through 1.11.22, 2.1 through 2.1.10 and 2.2 through 2.2.3. Exploitation can be performed remotely through any view that passes user\u2011controlled data to `QuerySet.filter()`, including the default Django\u2011Admin interface. Successful exploitation permits reading, modification or deletion of data in the connected PostgreSQL database and may facilitate further attacks such as remote code execution via PostgreSQL functions.",
