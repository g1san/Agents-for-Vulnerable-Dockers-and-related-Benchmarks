Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing, adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.  The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated.  As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.\n\n---\n- openssl 3.0.10-1 (bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1041818)\n[bookworm] - openssl 3.0.10-1~deb12u1\n[bullseye] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present, only affects 3.x)\n[buster] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present, only affects 3.x)\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230714.txt\nFixed by: https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=00e2f5eea29994d19293ec4e8c8775ba73678598 (openssl-3.0.10)",

This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

      "description": "Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.  Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.  When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length, via the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.  For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.  Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory exception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security critical.  Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate severity overall.  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.  OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\n---\n- openssl 3.0.12-1\n[bullseye] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present)\n[buster] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present)\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt",

      "description": "Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.  Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.  The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.  The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.  The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.\n\n---\n- openssl 3.1.5-1 (bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1060347)\n[bookworm] - openssl 3.0.13-1~deb12u1\n[bullseye] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present)\n[buster] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present)\nhttps://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt\nhttps://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015 (openssl-3.1)\nhttps://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35 (openssl-3.0)",

      "description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time.  Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take a long time.  An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.  Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size when performing the checks.  An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications when using the `-check` option.  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of service.  Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the application program.  Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.  TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they generally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity of the issue is Moderate.

      "description": "Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may trigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set and the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.  Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application.  The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications but they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs used by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.  In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash. Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be passed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have a 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases: 3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.\n\n---\n- openssl 3.5.4-1\n[bullseye] - openssl <not-affected> (Vulnerable code not present)\nhttps://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt",

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero.

      "description": "Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.  Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low.  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding.  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.  Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.

      "description": "A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.  A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.\n\n---\n- systemd 257.6-1 (bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1106785)\nhttps://www.qualys.com/2025/05/29/apport-coredump/apport-coredump.txt\nFor a comprehensive fix a kernel change is required (to hand a pidfd to the usermode\ncoredump helper):\nhttps://git.kernel.org/linus/b5325b2a270fcaf7b2a9a0f23d422ca8a5a8bdea\nBackports (src:linux):\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/CAMw=ZnT4KSk_+Z422mEZVzfAkTueKvzdw=r9ZB2JKg5-1t6BDw@mail.gmail.com/\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/49f1f2d4a7612bbed5211a73d11d6a94fbe3bb69 (main)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/0c49e0049b7665bb7769a13ef346fef92e1ad4d6 (main)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/8fc7b2a211eb13ef1a94250b28e1c79cab8bdcb9 (main)\nFollow up (optional): https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/13902e025321242b1d95c6d8b4e482b37f58cdef (main)\nFollow up (optional): https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/868d95577ec9f862580ad365726515459be582fc (main)\nFollow up (optional): https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/e6a8687b939ab21854f12f59a3cce703e32768cf (main)\nFollow up (optional): https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/76e0ab49c47965877c19772a2b3bf55f6417ca39 (main)\nFollow up (optional): https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/9ce8e3e449def92c75ada41b7d10c5bc3946be77 (main)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/0c49e0049b7665bb7769a13ef346fef92e1ad4d6 (v258)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/868d95577ec9f862580ad365726515459be582fc (v258)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/c58a8a6ec9817275bb4babaa2c08e0e35090d4e3 (v257.6)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/61556694affa290c0a16d48717b3892b85622d96 (v257.6)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/19d439189ab85dd7222bdd59fd442bbcc8ea99a7 (v256.16)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/commit/254ab8d2a7866679cee006d844d078774cbac3c9 (v255.21)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/commit/7fc7aa5a4d28d7768dfd1eb85be385c3ea949168 (v254.26)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/commit/19b228662e0fcc6596c0395a0af8486a4b3f1627 (v253.33)\nFixed by: https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/commit/2eb46dce078334805c547cbcf5e6462cf9d2f9f0 (v252.38)\nIssue relates to race condition exploitable while checking if a user should\nbe allowed to read a core file or not via the grant_user_access() function,\nwhich was introduced as part of the fix for CVE-2022-4415.",

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.  However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

      "description": "Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.  Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.  Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.  An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the \"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.

      "description": "### Summary\n\nIn the fallback extraction path for source distributions, `pip` used Python’s `tarfile` module without verifying that symbolic/hard link targets resolve inside the intended extraction directory. A malicious sdist can include links that escape the target directory and overwrite arbitrary files on the invoking host during `pip install`.\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation enables arbitrary file overwrite outside the build/extraction directory on the machine running `pip`. This can be leveraged to tamper with configuration or startup files and may lead to further code execution depending on the environment, but the direct, guaranteed impact is integrity compromise on the vulnerable system.\n\n### Conditions\n\nThe issue is triggered when installing an attacker-controlled sdist (e.g., from an index or URL) and the fallback extraction code path is used. No special privileges are required beyond running `pip install`; active user action is necessary.\n\n### Remediation\n\nThe [fix](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13550) is available starting in pip `25.3`. Using a Python interpreter that implements the safe-extraction behavior described by **PEP 706** provides additional defense in depth for other `tarfile` issues but is not a substitute for upgrading pip for this specific flaw.",

      "description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations  Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.  The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.  The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.  The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.  While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs. We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\n---\n- openssl 3.2.2-1 (bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1072113)\n[bookworm] - openssl 3.0.14-1~deb12u1\n[buster] - openssl <postponed> (Minor issue, fix along with next update round)\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c1bd38a003fa19fd0d8ade85e1bbc20d8ae59dab (master)\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac (openssl-3.2)\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d (openssl-3.0)",

Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.  Although the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to perform it is low.

      "description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.\n\n---\n- openssl 3.3.2-1 (bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1074487)\n[bookworm] - openssl 3.0.15-1~deb12u1\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2ebbe2d7ca8551c4cb5fbb391ab9af411708090e\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c6e1ea223510bb7104bf0c41c0c45eda5a16b718\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fc8ff75814767d6c55ea78d05adc72cd346d0f0a\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a210f580f450bbd08fac85f06e27107b8c580f9b\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/0d883f6309b6905d29ffded6d703ded39385579c\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9925c97a8e8c9887765a0979c35b516bc8c3af85\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e10a3a84bf73a3e6024c338b51f2fb4e78a3dee9\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/238fa464d6e38aa2c92af70ef9580c74cff512e4\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/de71058567b84c6e14b758a383e1862eb3efb921\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/214c724e00d594c3eecf4b740ee7af772f0ee04a",
