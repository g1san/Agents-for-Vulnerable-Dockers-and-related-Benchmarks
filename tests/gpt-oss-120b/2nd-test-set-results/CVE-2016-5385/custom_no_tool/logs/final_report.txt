CVE description: CVE‑2016‑5385 is the “httpoxy” vulnerability. In CGI or FastCGI environments the HTTP request header named `Proxy:` is transformed by the CGI specification into an environment variable called `HTTP_PROXY`. PHP copies this variable into its own process environment. Many PHP libraries (cURL, file_get_contents, Guzzle, etc.) automatically use the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to select an outbound proxy. An attacker can therefore send a crafted request containing a `Proxy:` header that sets `HTTP_PROXY` to an arbitrary value. Subsequent outbound HTTP requests made by the PHP application are forced through the attacker‑controlled proxy, enabling request redirection, man‑in‑the‑middle of internal traffic, data exfiltration or further server‑side attacks. The flaw is remotely exploitable without authentication and affects any PHP version that runs under CGI/FastCGI and does not clear the `HTTP_PROXY` variable.
Attack Type: proxy header injection that redirects outbound HTTP requests through an attacker controlled proxy

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup does not include the required services php or nginx, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, there is no php service present, therefore no vulnerable php version from the listed range is used, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup does not include the required services php or nginx, so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, there is no php service present, therefore no vulnerable php version from the listed range is used, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false.
	- FIX: Add a php service built from an image that includes one of the vulnerable PHP versions (for example php:5.6‑fpm) and a matching nginx service that forwards FastCGI requests to the php‑fpm container. In the docker‑compose.yml declare both services, link nginx to the php container, expose port 80 on nginx, and remove the existing python‑based vulnerable‑app service (or replace it with a small PHP script that echoes the HTTP_PROXY environment variable). Then adjust the nginx configuration to use fastcgi_pass php:9000 so that incoming HTTP requests are processed by the vulnerable PHP interpreter, satisfying the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The php image runs version 5.6.40, which is not included in the allowed vulnerable version list (5.6.0‑5.6.23, 7.0.0‑7.0.8). Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are both defined in the compose file, so services_ok is true.
	- ERROR: The php image runs version 5.6.40, which is not included in the allowed vulnerable version list (5.6.0‑5.6.23, 7.0.0‑7.0.8). Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are both defined in the compose file, so services_ok is true.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you need to run a PHP interpreter that falls within the explicitly allowed vulnerable range. Change the php service in docker‑compose.yml so that the image tag references a supported version, for example php:5.6.22‑fpm or php:7.0.8‑fpm instead of the current php:5.6‑fpm (which resolves to 5.6.40). By pinning the image to one of those listed releases the container will use a version that matches the defined vulnerability list, while the rest of the configuration—including the nginx service—remains unchanged.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑FPM image you reference (php:5.6.22-fpm) is not a currently published tag and, even if it were, the default php‑fpm configuration clears all environment variables (including HTTP_PROXY), which prevents the test script from ever seeing the injected header. Fix the problem by switching the PHP service to a valid, available tag such as php:5.6-fpm (or any 5.6‑fpm variant that exists on Docker Hub) and add a small override that disables the clear‑env behaviour – for example, mount a custom php‑fpm.conf that sets clear_env = no or set the environment variable PHP_FPM_CLEAR_ENV=no in the compose file. With a real image name and clear_env disabled, the containers will start and the index.php script will correctly expose the HTTP_PROXY variable, allowing you to reproduce the httpoxy condition.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The php service uses the image php:5.6-fpm which, according to the inspect output, has PHP_VERSION=5.6.40. The allowed versions list only includes php versions up to 5.6.23 (and some 7.0.x). Since 5.6.40 is not in the permitted range, the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are both present in the docker‑compose.yml, so services_ok is true.
	- ERROR: The php service uses the image php:5.6-fpm which, according to the inspect output, has PHP_VERSION=5.6.40. The allowed versions list only includes php versions up to 5.6.23 (and some 7.0.x). Since 5.6.40 is not in the permitted range, the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are both present in the docker‑compose.yml, so services_ok is true.
	- FIX: To satisfy the hard‑version check, replace the PHP image tag in the compose file with a version that appears in the allowed list—e.g., change `image: php:5.6-fpm` to `image: php:5.6.23-fpm` (or any other permitted 5.6.x release). After updating the tag, rerun `docker compose up` so the container is built from the approved PHP version while keeping the existing environment and volume configuration unchanged. This brings the php service into compliance without altering any other service definitions.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the php‑fpm image you are using (php:5.6.23‑fpm) expects the environment variable PHP_FPM_CLEAR_ENV to be set to “yes” or “no” **without** the “no_tool” directory being referenced, and the fastcgi_params file that Nginx includes expects the variable SCRIPT_FILENAME to be defined before the request is forwarded. To fix it, change the php service’s environment line to `- PHP_FPM_CLEAR_ENV=no` (as you already have) but also add `- PHP_FPM_PM=static` so the process starts correctly, and in the nginx config replace the single line `include fastcgi_params;` with `include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;` to ensure the correct file path is used. After those two edits the compose file will build and the containers will start, allowing the index.php script to read the HTTP_PROXY variable.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because Docker can’t find the exact PHP image you asked for – the official PHP repository only tags the 5.6 series as `5.6-fpm` (or with a later‑patch suffix like `5.6.40-fpm`), not `5.6.23-fpm`. Change the `php` service’s image line to a tag that actually exists, for example `image: php:5.6-fpm` (or pick the newest 5.6‑patch you want). If you still need the exact 5.6.23 binaries you can base a small Dockerfile on `php:5.6-fpm` and install that version manually, but the quickest fix is to use a valid tag. After correcting the image name the compose file will pull the image successfully and the rest of the configuration (environment flag, volume mounts, nginx fastcgi settings) will work as intended.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The php service uses the image php:5.6-fpm which corresponds to PHP version 5.6.40 (as shown in the image inspect Env PHP_VERSION=5.6.40). This version is not among the allowed versions list (which stops at 5.6.23 and then 7.0.x). Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are present in the docker‑compose.yml, so services_ok is satisfied.
	- ERROR: The php service uses the image php:5.6-fpm which corresponds to PHP version 5.6.40 (as shown in the image inspect Env PHP_VERSION=5.6.40). This version is not among the allowed versions list (which stops at 5.6.23 and then 7.0.x). Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are present in the docker‑compose.yml, so services_ok is satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the hard‑version requirement you need to replace the image reference for the php service with a tag that matches one of the allowed versions, for example change `image: php:5.6-fpm` to `image: php:5.6.23-fpm` (or use a 7.0.x tag such as `php:7.0.5-fpm`). Updating the docker‑compose.yml in this way makes the php container run a permitted PHP release while keeping the rest of the configuration unchanged, thereby meeting the code_hard_version milestone.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to “build” the PHP service even though only an image name is supplied, so when you run `docker‑compose up --build` Docker looks for a Dockerfile in the php context, can’t find one and aborts. The quickest fix is simply to stop asking Docker to rebuild the image – run the stack with plain `docker‑compose up` (or remove any `build:` entry if you added one). If you really need a custom image (for example to tweak the php‑fpm pool so that `clear_env = no` is set), create a minimal Dockerfile in the php service directory (e.g. `FROM php:5.6.23-fpm && echo "clear_env = no" >> /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf`) and then point the compose file to it with `build: .`; otherwise just rely on the pre‑built `php:5.6.23‑fpm` image and launch with `docker‑compose up`. This removes the build‑time error and lets the containers start so you can test the httpoxy condition.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The php service uses PHP version 5.6.40 (as indicated by the PHP_VERSION environment variable in the custom_no_tool-php image), which is not included in the allowed version list. Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are both defined in the compose file, so services_ok is true.
	- ERROR: The php service uses PHP version 5.6.40 (as indicated by the PHP_VERSION environment variable in the custom_no_tool-php image), which is not included in the allowed version list. Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services php and nginx are both defined in the compose file, so services_ok is true.
	- FIX: To satisfy the hard‑version check, change the PHP base image to one of the versions that appear in the allowed list—for example, replace `FROM php:5.6-fpm` in `./php/Dockerfile` with `FROM php:5.6.22-fpm` (or any other 5.6.x version that is enumerated). After rebuilding the image, the `php` service will report a version that matches the permitted set, and the compose file will meet the `code_hard_version` milestone while keeping the existing configuration unchanged.
