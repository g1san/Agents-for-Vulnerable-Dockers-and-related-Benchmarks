    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20115385 is the \u201chttpoxy\u201d vulnerability. In CGI or FastCGI environments the HTTP request header named `Proxy:` is transformed by the CGI specification into an environment variable called `HTTP_PROXY`. PHP copies this variable into its own process environment. Many PHP libraries (cURL, file_get_contents, Guzzle, etc.) automatically use the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to select an outbound proxy. An attacker can therefore send a crafted request containing a `Proxy:` header that sets `HTTP_PROXY` to an arbitrary value. Subsequent outbound HTTP requests made by the PHP application are forced through the attacker\u2011controlled proxy, enabling request redirection, man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle of internal traffic, data exfiltration or further server\u2011side attacks. The flaw is remotely exploitable without authentication and affects any PHP version that runs under CGI/FastCGI and does not clear the `HTTP_PROXY` variable.",
