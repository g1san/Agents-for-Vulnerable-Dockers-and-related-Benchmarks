    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201110054 is a vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine. The flaw resides in the `CREATE ALIAS` SQL statement which allows an attacker who can send SQL to the H2 instance to define a Java method as an alias and then invoke it. The H2 built\u2011in web console (accessible via HTTP) does not require authentication by default and, when started with the configuration option `webAllowOthers=true`, can be reached from remote hosts. This enables an unauthenticated attacker to issue a crafted `CREATE ALIAS` statement that executes arbitrary Java code on the host, resulting in full remote code execution. The vulnerability is present in all public releases of H2 because no patch has been released; the risk is mitigated only by configuration (binding the console to localhost, requiring authentication, or disabling the console).",
