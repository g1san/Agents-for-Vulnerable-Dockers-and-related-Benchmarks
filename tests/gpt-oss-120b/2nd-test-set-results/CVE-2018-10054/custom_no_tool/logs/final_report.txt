CVE description: CVE‑2018‑10054 is a vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine. The flaw resides in the `CREATE ALIAS` SQL statement which allows an attacker who can send SQL to the H2 instance to define a Java method as an alias and then invoke it. The H2 built‑in web console (accessible via HTTP) does not require authentication by default and, when started with the configuration option `webAllowOthers=true`, can be reached from remote hosts. This enables an unauthenticated attacker to issue a crafted `CREATE ALIAS` statement that executes arbitrary Java code on the host, resulting in full remote code execution. The vulnerability is present in all public releases of H2 because no patch has been released; the risk is mitigated only by configuration (binding the console to localhost, requiring authentication, or disabling the console).

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim‑Python image does not contain the MySQL client development headers that the Dockerfile asks for – the package name `libmysqlclient-dev` is not available in that distribution. Change the apt line to install the correct header package (for Debian‑based slim images it’s `default-libmysqlclient-dev`), then clean up the APT cache exactly as before. While you’re at it, you can streamline the image by installing the Python requirements before copying the whole source tree (copy only `requirements.txt`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then copy the remaining code). With these two adjustments the Dockerfile will run to completion and the compose stack will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The simplest way to get the stack running is to make the web service wait until MySQL is actually ready and to correct the health‑check so it contacts the right host. Change the healthcheck in the compose file from `"mysqladmin … -h localhost"` to `"mysqladmin … -h db"` (or just drop the host flag and let the client use the container name) and add a small wait‑script or use Docker’s built‑in `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` so the Flask container only starts after the DB reports healthy. In the Flask app, keep the `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)` line unchanged, but remove `debug=True` for production use. After those two tweaks the containers should start without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is continuously printing 'Waiting for MySQL at db:3306...' and the STDERR repeatedly shows '/app/wait-for-db.sh: 8: mysqladmin: not found'. This indicates the wait-for-db script cannot locate the mysqladmin client, so it never detects the database as ready and never proceeds to start the main application (app.py). Although Docker reports the container status as running, the service inside is stuck in a startup loop and is not operating correctly.

Although Docker reports the container status as running, the service inside is stuck in a startup loop and is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: Add the MySQL client tools to the web image so the script can run `mysqladmin`. In the Dockerfile for the web service, extend the install line to include the package that provides the client (e.g., `default-mysql-client` or `mysql-client`) – for example: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc default-libmysqlclient-dev default-mysql-client && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. After rebuilding the image and redeploying, the `wait-for-db.sh` script will find `mysqladmin`, detect when the database is ready, and then start `app.py`.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that stays down is most likely the *web* service waiting forever for MySQL because the health‑check on the *db* service never turns green – the test inside the MySQL container is trying to ping a host named “db”, which only exists on the Docker network, not inside the MySQL container itself. Change the health‑check command to contact the local MySQL instance (e.g. use `-h localhost` or omit the host argument entirely). After the health‑check succeeds, the `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` will let the Flask container start, and the `wait‑for‑db.sh` script will also succeed because it can reach the MySQL server on the network name “db”. Once you adjust the health‑check, rebuild and restart the stack and both containers should come up normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack doesn’t come up is that the MySQL container tries to bind host port 3306, which is typically already occupied by a local MySQL server, so Docker aborts the `db` service and the `web` service never sees a healthy database. Change the port mapping to an unused host port (for example `3307:3306`) or remove the mapping altogether if you only need internal communication. After that, restart the compose file; the health‑check will pass, the `wait‑for‑db.sh` script will detect the database, and the Flask container will start successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The composition uses a custom web image based on python:3.7-slim and a MySQL 5.6 image. Neither h2database/h2 nor openjdk are referenced in the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, or the inspected image metadata, so the required services are not present. Consequently, the services_ok milestone fails. Because h2database/h2 is not used at all, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable list, so the code_hard_version milestone also fails.

Neither h2database/h2 nor openjdk are referenced in the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, or the inspected image metadata, so the required services are not present. Consequently, the services_ok milestone fails. Because h2database/h2 is not used at all, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable list, so the code_hard_version milestone also fails.
	- FIX: Add an H2 service to the compose file (for example `image: h2database/h2:1.4.200`) and configure it so the web console is either disabled or bound only to localhost (set `-webAllowOthers=false` or omit the flag entirely). Then expose the H2 port only for internal containers (e.g., `ports: ["9092"]` without a public mapping) and adjust the web application to connect to that internal H2 instance instead of MySQL if the test requires H2. By supplying the missing H2 component and restricting or disabling the console you satisfy the services_ok milestone and avoid the CVE‑2018‑10054 exposure.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the H2 image you’re extending does not contain a jar called `/opt/h2.jar` and the `/data` directory isn’t created beforehand, so the `java -cp … RunScript` command can’t find the driver or write the database file. Change the `Dockerfile` to point at the actual jar that ships with the base image (e.g. `/opt/h2*.jar`), create the database directory, and then run the init script; after that the rest of the file can stay the same. In practice that means adding a line such as `RUN mkdir -p /data && java -cp /opt/h2*.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:/data/test -script /init.sql -user sa -password '' && rm /init.sql` and removing the reference to the non‑existent `/opt/h2.jar`. Once the classpath points to a real jar and the target folder exists, the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the H2 image is being asked to run a script with a wildcard‑based classpath and with MySQL‑style column definitions that H2 does not understand. Change the H2 Dockerfile so the `RUN` that executes `RunScript` is written in shell form (so the `*` is expanded) and point it at the exact jar name, and adjust the DDL in `init.sql` to use H2’s `IDENTITY` syntax instead of MySQL’s `AUTO_INCREMENT`. For example, replace the `RUN` line with something like:

```
RUN set -eux; \
    jar=$(ls /opt/h2*.jar); \
    java -cp "$jar" org.h2.tools.RunScript \
        -url jdbc:h2:/data/test \
        -script /init.sql \
        -user sa \
        -password '' && \
    rm /init.sql
```

and modify `init.sql` so the table is created as:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,   -- or, for pure H2: id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

(You can pick either the H2‑specific `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` or keep `AUTO_INCREMENT` if you also add `SET MODE MySQL;` at the top of the script.) After these two changes the H2 image will build successfully and the rest of the compose stack will start as intended.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the web image tries to install a whole set of development packages (gcc, default‑libmysqlclient‑dev, default‑mysql‑client) that aren’t available in the slim‑based Python image and aren’t needed for this Flask app, and the h2 image’s CMD uses a wildcard (`/opt/h2*.jar`) that never expands in the exec‑form JSON array. To fix it, trim the web Dockerfile to only install what Flask needs (just pip and the requirements file) and delete the unnecessary apt‑get line, and replace the h2 CMD with a shell form that resolves the JAR at runtime, for example:

```
CMD ["sh","-c","java -cp /opt/h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server -tcp -tcpPort 9092 -tcpAllowOthers false -baseDir /data"]
```

or, better yet, hard‑code the exact JAR name (e.g. `h2-1.4.200.jar`) in the command. After these two changes the images will build and the compose stack will start correctly.
