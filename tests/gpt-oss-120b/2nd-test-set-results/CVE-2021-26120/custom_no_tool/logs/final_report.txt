----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2021‑26120 is a critical vulnerability in the Smarty 3 template engine (versions 3.1.0 through 3.1.38). The flaw resides in the handling of the `{function}` tag: the parser inserts the supplied function name directly into the generated PHP code without proper quoting or validation. An attacker who can influence the template content or the name of a template that is rendered can provide a malicious function name such as `rce(){};system("id");function`. When Smarty compiles the template, the injected PHP code becomes part of the compiled template file and is executed with the privileges of the web‑server process. This results in arbitrary PHP code execution, enabling full compromise of the affected host (confidentiality, integrity and availability are all broken). The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without authentication, requires only low‑complexity attacker interaction (supplying a crafted template or template name), and is exploitable even when Smarty’s sandbox mode is enabled because the code injection bypasses sandbox restrictions. The issue was fixed in Smarty version 3.1.39, where the function‑name handling was hardened to reject unexpected characters and to quote the name safely.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][php][['8.0-apache', '8.1-apache', '8.2-apache']] Official PHP image with Apache web server. The application code installed in this container includes the Smarty library versions 3.1.0 through 3.1.38, which are vulnerable to CVE‑2021‑26120. Running the vulnerable Smarty version inside this container provides the necessary environment to reproduce the code‑injection flaw.
- [SOFT-DB][composer][['2.5']] Composer is used to install the specific vulnerable Smarty versions into the PHP container. It is required only to set up the application dependencies and does not itself affect the vulnerability.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack fails to start is that the DinD service never brings up a listening Docker daemon, which in turn makes the Flask container’s `docker.DockerClient` connection fail. Fix it by disabling DinD’s default TLS setup and by simplifying the daemon start‑up command: add `environment: - DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` under the `docker` service and change its command to `["-H", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]`. You can also drop the `privileged: true` flag from the `vulnerable_app` service because the Flask container only needs network access to the DinD API, not full host privileges. After those two changes the Flask app will be able to reach the Docker daemon, the container launch will succeed, and the system will come up correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running (State.Running=True), but the application aborts during startup. The logs show a traceback from app.py where it attempts to create a Docker client with base_url='tcp://docker:2375' and repeatedly fails with ConnectionRefusedError (HTTPConnectionPool host='docker' port=2375). This prevents the Docker client from initializing and likely stops the Flask app from working correctly, even though the Flask server prints its startup messages. Therefore the container is not operating correctly.

The logs show a traceback from app.py where it attempts to create a Docker client with base_url='tcp://docker:2375' and repeatedly fails with ConnectionRefusedError (HTTPConnectionPool host='docker' port=2375). This prevents the Docker client from initializing and likely stops the Flask app from working correctly, even though the Flask server prints its startup messages. Therefore the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The Flask container needs to wait until the docker service is listening on tcp://docker:2375 before it creates the client; you can wrap the docker.DockerClient initialization in a short retry loop (catch ConnectionRefusedError, sleep a few seconds, and try again) or simply defer client creation until the first request arrives. Updating app.py to import time and perform the connection attempt inside a while loop with a timeout, or moving the client instantiation into the exploit handler, ensures the Flask process starts even if the Docker daemon isn’t ready at container launch, eliminating the startup abort.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The composed stack contains only a Python‑based application (python:3.9‑slim), a Docker‑in‑Docker daemon (docker:20.10.2‑dind) and a MySQL server (mysql:5.7). None of the images use any of the listed PHP versions (8.0‑apache, 8.1‑apache, 8.2‑apache), so the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. Likewise, the stack does not include PHP or Composer services, which are required for the 'services_ok' milestone, resulting in that flag being false as well.

Likewise, the stack does not include PHP or Composer services, which are required for the 'services_ok' milestone, resulting in that flag being false as well.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to replace the Python‑based service with a PHP‑Apache container that runs the vulnerable Smarty library and pulls in Composer for dependency installation. Change the `vulnerable_app` service to build from a Dockerfile based on one of the required images (for example `php:8.0-apache`), add a `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y git unzip && curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php && mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer` step, and then use Composer to require the specific Smarty version (3.1.0‑38) inside the image. Adjust the `docker-compose.yml` so that the `vulnerable_app` image matches the allowed PHP versions (8.0‑apache, 8.1‑apache, or 8.2‑apache) and the `depends_on` list includes the Composer‑based setup, thereby meeting both the `code_hard_version` and `services_ok` requirements. The rest of the stack (dind and MySQL) can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑Apache image does not have the required extensions for Composer and Smarty, and the Dockerfile tries to run Composer before the vendor directory exists; moving the Composer install step after copying the source fixes the order, and adding the missing `libpng-dev` and `libjpeg-dev` packages (or any other libraries the installed version of Smarty needs) before `docker-php-ext-install zip` resolves the missing dependency error. Also, the `docker` service is labeled with a CVE that is unrelated to the application layer, so either rename that service to avoid confusion or remove the comment that claims it contains CVE‑2021‑26120. After adjusting the Dockerfile to install system packages, run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y git unzip libzip-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev && docker-php-ext-install zip` and placing the `composer require` line after the `COPY . /var/www/html` line, the image builds correctly.
