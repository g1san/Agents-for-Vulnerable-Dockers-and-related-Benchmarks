    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201151449 is a file\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Gradio Python package, which is used to build interactive web interfaces for machine\u2011learning models and other Python functions. The flaw resides in the `/file` endpoint that serves files uploaded to a Gradio demo. Gradio attempts to restrict the served file to its temporary directory, but the path\u2011validation logic fails for sub\u2011directories created via the `/upload` endpoint. An attacker can first upload a file to cause Gradio to create a sub\u2011folder inside the temporary directory and then request a path such as `../../../../etc/passwd` (or any other file on the host) using the `/file` route. The server erroneously follows the `../` sequences and returns the contents of the target file. The vulnerability exists in every Gradio release from 4.0.0 through 4.10.0 (the vulnerability was introduced in 4.0.0 and persisted through 4.10.0). It allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on any system running a public Gradio interface, including Hugging\u202fFace Spaces, potentially exposing environment\u2011stored secrets, API keys, configuration files, or source code. The issue is fixed in Gradio version 4.11.0 and later. The attack type is arbitrary file read.",
