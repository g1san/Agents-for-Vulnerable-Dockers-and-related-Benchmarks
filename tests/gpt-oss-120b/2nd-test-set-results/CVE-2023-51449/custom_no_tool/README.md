CVE-2023-51449 Exploit Test Environment
======================================

This repository contains a minimal Docker Compose setup that reproduces the vulnerable configuration for CVE-2023-51449. The vulnerability exists in the Redis service (version 6.2.5) when it is started with `--protected-mode no`, allowing unauthenticated clients to issue arbitrary commands. The accompanying PHP web application interacts with Redis without any input sanitization, providing a convenient vector to trigger the flaw.

## Deploying the Environment

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your host.
2. From the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file, run:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. The services will start:
   - **vulnerable-redis** on host port **6379**
   - **vulnerable-web** on host port **8080**
   - **vulnerable-gradio** on host port **7860**

## Testing the Vulnerability

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the PHP demo, or `http://localhost:7860` to interact with the Gradio demo. Use the form to set a key/value pair. Since the Redis instance is exposed without authentication, you can also interact directly with it using `redis-cli`:

```bash
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
# Example command that demonstrates unauthenticated access
> CONFIG GET requirepass
``` 

Because `protected-mode` is disabled, the server accepts any command, which is the core issue described in CVE-2023-51449.

## Cleanup

To stop and remove the containers, run:
```bash
docker compose down
```
