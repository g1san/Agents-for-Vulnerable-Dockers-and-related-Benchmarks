    "desc": "CVE-2015-1427 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Elasticsearch's Groovy scripting engine. Versions prior to 1.3.8 and 1.4.3 allow unauthenticated users to submit Groovy scripts via the _search (or similar) API. The sandbox can be bypassed by invoking java.lang.Math.class.forName to load arbitrary Java classes such as java.lang.Runtime, enabling execution of any operating\u2011system command with the privileges of the Elasticsearch JVM process. Exploitation requires only network access to the HTTP port (default 9200) and the ability to send a crafted JSON request containing the malicious script. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control of the host, allowing data theft, service disruption, or installation of further malware.",
