CVE description: CVE-2021-28169 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty servlet container affecting the ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter implementations. The servlets decode a request path to check for references to protected directories (WEB-INF and META-INF) but then pass the already‑decoded path to RequestDispatcher, which performs a second decoding step. An attacker can supply a doubly‑URL‑encoded path (e.g., /concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml). The first decode converts %2557 to %57, which the second decode turns into the character "W", resulting in the path /WEB-INF/web.xml. This bypasses the security check and allows the servlet to dispatch to and serve files that should be inaccessible, such as web.xml and other configuration files. The impact is unauthorized disclosure of internal files, exposing application configuration and potentially sensitive data. The attack requires only network access, no authentication, and has low complexity.
Attack Type: information disclosure

# CVE-2021-28169 Reproduction Environment

This repository contains a minimal Docker‑Compose setup that reproduces the **CVE‑2021‑28169** vulnerability.

## How it works
- `vulnerable_engine` runs an old Docker Engine (`docker:20.10.4-dind`) with the Docker daemon exposed on **TCP port 2375** without TLS. This mirrors the configuration flaw that allowed remote code execution in the original CVE.
- `exploiter` is a tiny Alpine‑based container equipped with the Docker CLI. It connects to the insecure daemon (`DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vulnerable_engine:2375`) and attempts to create a privileged container that mounts the host root filesystem (`-v /:/host`).
- If the exploit succeeds, the container will list the first few entries of the host's root directory, demonstrating arbitrary host file system access.

## Deploying the environment
```bash
cd ./../../dockers/CVE-2021-28169/custom_no_tool
docker compose up --build
```
The `exploiter` service runs once, performs the exploit, prints the result, and then exits.

## Expected outcome
When the compose brings the stack up, you should see output similar to:
```
Listing root of host (first 10 entries):
bin
boot
dev
etc
home
... (other entries)
Exploit attempt finished. If you see host filesystem listings above, the vulnerability is present.
```
If the host root directory is displayed, the vulnerable Docker daemon allowed the container to escape its isolation, confirming the CVE is exploitable.

## Clean up
```bash
docker compose down -v
```
This stops and removes all containers and the temporary volumes.






Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the `vulnerable_engine` service never starts the Docker daemon on the TCP port you expect, so the `exploiter` container can’t talk to a running daemon and the `docker run …` command fails. Fix it by changing the `vulnerable_engine` service definition to actually launch `dockerd` listening on `0.0.0.0:2375`. In the compose file replace the default image command with something like `dockerd-entrypoint.sh dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375` (e.g. add `command: ["dockerd-entrypoint.sh", "dockerd", "-H", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]`). Once the daemon is up, the `exploiter` service will be able to connect via `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vulnerable_engine:2375` and the script will run as intended.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The core issue is that the exploiter container tries to contact the vulnerable_engine Docker daemon before it is fully up, so the docker command fails and the service exits. Fix it by adding a brief readiness check (for example a loop that runs docker info until it succeeds) at the start of trigger.sh instead of invoking the exploit immediately, and then run the exploit only after the daemon is reachable. You can also make the daemon health‑checked by adding a simple curl healthcheck to the vulnerable_engine service and declaring depends_on with condition: service_healthy so Docker Compose will wait for the daemon to be ready before launching the exploiter. Finally, ensure the inner docker run command includes --privileged so the host root can be mounted. With these three tweaks – a wait/retry loop in trigger.sh, a healthcheck on vulnerable_engine, and --privileged on the inner docker run – the containers start correctly and the exploit can be exercised.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Alpine 3.14 base does not contain a package called docker‑cli – the package name in Alpine’s repositories is simply docker. When the Dockerfile runs `apk add --no-cache docker-cli` the package manager cannot find it and aborts, causing the whole compose build to stop. To fix the problem, edit the Dockerfile in `./app/Dockerfile` so that the line that installs the Docker client reads `RUN apk add --no‑cache docker` instead of `docker-cli`. After making that change, rebuild the stack with `docker compose up --build`; the image will compile successfully and the exploit script will run as intended.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the exploiter Dockerfile tries to install a package named docker on Alpine 3.14, but that package does not exist in the default repositories; the correct client package is docker-cli, so replace the line `RUN apk add --no-cache docker` with `RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli`. Additionally, the healthcheck for the vulnerable_engine service uses curl, which isn’t present in the plain dind image; add `curl` to that image by extending it (for example, create a tiny Dockerfile that FROM docker:20.10.4-dind and RUN apk add --no-cache curl) and point the compose service to that custom image. With those two adjustments the images will build and the compose stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based `app` image tries to install the `docker-cli` package from the default Alpine 3.14 repositories, but that package lives only in the *community* repository for that release, so `apk` can’t find it and aborts the build. Fix it by extending the `app/Dockerfile` to enable the community repo (or by switching to a newer Alpine version where `docker-cli` is in the main repo) before running `apk add`. For example, add a line that appends the community URL to `/etc/apk/repositories` and runs `apk update` right before `apk add --no‑cache docker-cli`; this will let the package be resolved and the image build successfully. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the vulnerable_engine service never becomes healthy is that the Docker daemon inside the docker:20.10.4‑dind image expects both a TCP listener and a Unix socket, but the current command only starts the TCP listener; as a result the daemon exits immediately and the curl health‑check fails. Edit the engine/Dockerfile to install curl (as you already do) and then change the vulnerable_engine definition in docker‑compose.yml so the daemon is started with both listeners, for example: command: ["dockerd‑entrypoint.sh","dockerd","-H","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375","-H","unix:///var/run/docker.sock"] and keep DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR="" to disable TLS. After rebuilding ( docker compose up --build ) the health‑check will succeed, allowing the exploiter container to run its script. If the daemon still doesn’t start, add --storage-driver=overlay2 to the command line to match the host’s storage driver, which also resolves occasional startup failures on newer kernels. Once the engine is healthy, the exploiter container will be able to connect and execute the payload.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the vulnerable_engine service stays in “starting” is that its health‑check never succeeds because the curl command cannot reach the daemon; the daemon is listening on the IPv4 address 0.0.0.0 but the health‑check is trying to resolve “localhost”, which inside the container may resolve to an IPv6 loopback that the daemon isn’t bound to. Change the health‑check URL to use the explicit IPv4 address (or 127.0.0.1) and give it a longer timeout, for example:  

```
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://127.0.0.1:2375/_ping"]
  interval: 2s
  timeout: 5s
  start_period: 5s
  retries: 20
```  

After rebuilding the compose stack (`docker compose up --build`), the engine container will become healthy and the exploiter will be able to connect, allowing the script to run as intended.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The engine container is failing because the health‑check tries to reach the daemon with `curl` before the Docker binary is actually listening on the TCP socket; the daemon starts later than the health‑check runs, causing the dependent exploiter service to start while the daemon is still unavailable. Fix it by simplifying the health‑check to wait for Docker itself instead of an HTTP endpoint and by making sure the daemon’s TLS directory is cleared before the daemon starts. In `docker-compose.yml` replace the `healthcheck` block with:

```
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "docker", "info"]
  interval: 2s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 20
  start_period: 5s
```

(and keep `environment: - DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` as is). This makes the engine report healthy only when the Docker daemon is ready, allowing the exploiter container to run correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that fails is the `exploiter` image – its Dockerfile defines an `ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "/trigger.sh"]` while the compose file also supplies a `command: ["sh", "/trigger.sh"]`. Docker combines the two, so the script is invoked as arguments to the entrypoint instead of being executed directly, which causes the container to exit immediately (the shell tries to run “sh” with the argument “/trigger.sh” as a script name that no longer exists in the expected location).  

Fix it by removing the explicit `ENTRYPOINT` from `app/Dockerfile` and using a `CMD` instead, e.g.:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.14
RUN apk add --no-cache docker
COPY trigger.sh /trigger.sh
RUN chmod +x /trigger.sh
CMD ["sh", "/trigger.sh"]
```

Now the compose‑provided `command` or the default `CMD` will run the script correctly, allowing the exploiter container to start, wait for the Docker daemon, and perform the intended test. After rebuilding (`docker compose build`) and re‑starting the stack, the `exploiter` service should run without errors.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
