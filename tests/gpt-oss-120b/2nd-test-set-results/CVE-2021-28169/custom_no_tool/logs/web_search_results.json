    "desc": "CVE-2021-28169 is a vulnerability in the Eclipse Jetty servlet container affecting the ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter implementations. The servlets decode a request path to check for references to protected directories (WEB-INF and META-INF) but then pass the already\u2011decoded path to RequestDispatcher, which performs a second decoding step. An attacker can supply a doubly\u2011URL\u2011encoded path (e.g., /concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml). The first decode converts %2557 to %57, which the second decode turns into the character \"W\", resulting in the path /WEB-INF/web.xml. This bypasses the security check and allows the servlet to dispatch to and serve files that should be inaccessible, such as web.xml and other configuration files. The impact is unauthorized disclosure of internal files, exposing application configuration and potentially sensitive data. The attack requires only network access, no authentication, and has low complexity.",
