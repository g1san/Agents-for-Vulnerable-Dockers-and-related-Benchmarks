    "desc": "CVE-2016-1898 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework (including its Libav fork) that affects versions in the 2.x series. The flaw resides in the handling of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist files (\\.m3u8). When a crafted playlist contains a *subfile* or *concat* entry, FFmpeg builds a remote URL that incorporates data read from the local filesystem. The library then issues an HTTP request using that URL, causing the contents of arbitrary local files to be sent to an attacker\u2011controlled server. This results in unauthorized disclosure of file contents (information leakage) and can also be leveraged for server\u2011side request forgery because the request can be directed to internal network resources.",
