CVE description: CVE-2016-1898 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework (including its Libav fork) that affects versions in the 2.x series. The flaw resides in the handling of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist files (\.m3u8). When a crafted playlist contains a *subfile* or *concat* entry, FFmpeg builds a remote URL that incorporates data read from the local filesystem. The library then issues an HTTP request using that URL, causing the contents of arbitrary local files to be sent to an attacker‑controlled server. This results in unauthorized disclosure of file contents (information leakage) and can also be leveraged for server‑side request forgery because the request can be directed to internal network resources.
Attack Type: Server‑side request forgery and arbitrary file content disclosure
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ffmpeg][['2.5.0', '2.5.1', '2.5.2', '2.5.3', '2.5.4', '2.5.5', '2.5.6', '2.5.7', '2.5.8', '2.5.9', '2.6.0', '2.6.1', '2.6.2', '2.6.3', '2.6.4', '2.6.5', '2.6.6', '2.7.0', '2.7.1', '2.7.2', '2.7.3', '2.7.4', '2.8.0', '2.8.1', '2.8.2', '2.8.3', '2.8.4']] This is the vulnerable FFmpeg library version that contains the flawed HLS playlist parsing leading to SSRF and arbitrary file disclosure.
- [SOFT-BASE][alpine][['3.12']] Base Linux distribution used to run the vulnerable FFmpeg binary inside the container.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The dind service is using the very old docker:1.12-dind image, which no longer matches the current Docker engine API and often fails to start the daemon on modern kernels when the overlay2 driver is forced. Switch the image to a current dind release (for example docker:24-dind) and let the entrypoint launch the daemon with the overlay2 option, then the container will come up cleanly. In practice you would replace the image line with docker:24-dind  (or the latest stable tag), keep privileged: true and the volume mapping, and change the command to ["dockerd","--storage-driver=overlay2"] or simply omit command so the default entrypoint runs with the overlay2 driver automatically. This update aligns the dind image with the host kernel and resolves the startup failure.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker images (docker:24-dind and docker:1.12-dind) are Docker Engine images and do not contain the ffmpeg service, nor do they specify an ffmpeg version that could be compared to the allowed list. Consequently, the 'code_hard_version' milestone, which requires the use of an ffmpeg version from the supplied list, cannot be satisfied. Additionally, the docker-compose.yml defines only a single service named 'dind' based on the Docker images; it does not reference the required services 'ffmpeg' or 'alpine'. Therefore, the 'services_ok' milestone, which expects these services to be present, also fails.

Therefore, the 'services_ok' milestone, which expects these services to be present, also fails.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to replace the current single‑service definition with a small stack that explicitly runs the vulnerable FFmpeg binary on an Alpine base that matches the allowed version list. First, add a new service (for example named ffmpeg) that uses the alpine:3.12 image, then install the exact FFmpeg 2.x package (or copy a pre‑built binary) matching one of the versions listed in the CVE description; you can do this with a custom Dockerfile that starts FROM alpine:3.12, adds the appropriate FFmpeg 2.x package repository or copies the binary, and sets the entrypoint to run FFmpeg. Keep the existing dind service if you still need Docker‑in‑Docker, but ensure both services are declared under services so the compose file contains both ffmpeg and dind. By referencing the correct base image and installing a permitted FFmpeg version, the compose file will meet both the code_hard_version and services_ok milestones.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg build step is failing because the line‑continuation syntax in the Dockerfile is malformed – the space after each backslash turns the backslash into a literal character, breaking the `apk add` command and later causing the `curl` download line to be interpreted incorrectly. Remove the stray spaces after the backslashes (e.g. change `curl \ ` to `curl \`) and keep the backslashes directly followed by a newline, then collapse the whole `RUN` into a single, correctly‑continued command. After fixing the line continuations, the image will build successfully and the `ffmpeg` service will start; you can keep the existing `ENTRYPOINT` or replace it with an interactive shell if you need a terminal, but the critical change is correcting the Dockerfile syntax so the container can run.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg service fails because the Dockerfile builds FFmpeg but never installs the runtime libraries it needs (for example libstdc++, libgcc and the shared libraries for libav* that are installed into /usr/local/lib); when the container starts the linker cannot find them, causing the process to exit immediately. Add a step after the build to copy the libraries into a standard location and update the loader cache, e.g. after “make install” run `apk add --no-cache libstdc++ && ldconfig` or set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`. Also make sure the ffmpeg service uses a command that actually runs the binary (the current ENTRYPOINT just prints the version and exits); replace the entrypoint with something like `["ffmpeg", "-i", "input.mp4", "output.flv"]` or override it at runtime so the container stays alive. With those changes the ffmpeg container will start correctly and the dind service can be accessed as before.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ffmpeg image currently sets an ENTRYPOINT that runs `ffmpeg -version`; when the compose file supplies its own command the entrypoint is still invoked, so the container exits after printing the version and never reaches the long‑running shell loop. Delete the `ENTRYPOINT ["ffmpeg", "-version"]` line (or replace it with a simple `CMD ["ffmpeg","-version"]` if you still want that as the default) so the container will start with the command defined in the compose file and stay up. After rebuilding the image and redeploying the stack the ffmpeg service should run correctly.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
