    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201142342 is a critical vulnerability in the Embedthis GoAhead embedded web server (versions 4.x and 5.x prior to 5.1.5). The flaw resides in the file\u2011upload filter which fails to prepend the required \"CGI_\" prefix to form\u2011field variables. As a result, an attacker can supply arbitrary environment variables (for example, LD_PRELOAD) that are passed unchanged to CGI scripts. By uploading a malicious shared\u2011object library and setting LD_PRELOAD to point to it (e.g., via /proc/self/fd/0), the server loads the attacker\u2011controlled library when executing a CGI script. The library\u2019s constructor runs before the CGI program\u2019s main function, giving the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. This results in remote code execution without authentication.",
