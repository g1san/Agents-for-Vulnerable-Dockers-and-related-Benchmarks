CVE description: CVE‑2021‑42342 is a critical vulnerability in the Embedthis GoAhead embedded web server (versions 4.x and 5.x prior to 5.1.5). The flaw resides in the file‑upload filter which fails to prepend the required "CGI_" prefix to form‑field variables. As a result, an attacker can supply arbitrary environment variables (for example, LD_PRELOAD) that are passed unchanged to CGI scripts. By uploading a malicious shared‑object library and setting LD_PRELOAD to point to it (e.g., via /proc/self/fd/0), the server loads the attacker‑controlled library when executing a CGI script. The library’s constructor runs before the CGI program’s main function, giving the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web‑server process. This results in remote code execution without authentication.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][embedthis/goahead][['4.0', '4.1', '5.0', '5.1.0', '5.1.1', '5.1.2', '5.1.3', '5.1.4']] Vulnerable GoAhead web server image providing the file‑upload filter that allows environment‑variable injection leading to remote code execution.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.27.0']] Optional reverse‑proxy to expose the GoAhead service on standard HTTP ports and to allow convenient testing of the vulnerability.

This is the first version of the generated code:

# creating a container that mounts the host's root filesystem via the
# vulnerable Docker daemon.

# Pull a lightweight image
docker pull alpine:3.14

# Run a privileged container that mounts the host root (requires the vulnerable daemon)
# The command will list the host's /etc/passwd as proof of concept.

docker run --rm --privileged -v /:/host alpine:3.14 sh -c "cat /host/etc/passwd"






Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the *exploit‑client* container cannot talk to the Docker daemon that runs inside the *vulnerable‑docker* service, so the `docker` commands inside `exploit.sh` fail and the container exits immediately. The easiest way to fix this is to make the daemon reachable over plain TCP (disable the automatic TLS setup) and to let the client use the normal Docker bridge network instead of the “service” network mode, which isolates it from DNS resolution of the daemon’s hostname.

Edit **docker‑compose.yml** as follows: set `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` (or an empty value) in the `environment` section of the *vulnerable‑docker* service so that the internal `dockerd` listens on `0.0.0.0:2375` without TLS; remove the line `network_mode: service:vulnerable-docker` from the *exploit‑client* service so it runs on the default bridge network (or explicitly set `network_mode: bridge`). With these changes the `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vulnerable-docker:2375` variable will resolve correctly, the client will be able to pull the Alpine image and start the privileged container that mounts the host root, and the compose stack will start without errors.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file only uses the docker:20.10.7-dind image and a custom Alpine‑based exploit client. Neither embedthis/goahead nor nginx appears in the services, so the required services list is not satisfied. Additionally, no embedthis/goahead image is used, so none of the listed vulnerable versions (4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1.0‑5.1.4) are present. Consequently both milestones fail.
	- ERROR: The compose file only uses the docker:20.10.7-dind image and a custom Alpine‑based exploit client. Neither embedthis/goahead nor nginx appears in the services, so the required services list is not satisfied. Additionally, no embedthis/goahead image is used, so none of the listed vulnerable versions (4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1.0‑5.1.4) are present. Consequently both milestones fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services you need to add a goahead service based on one of the vulnerable image tags (for example embedthis/goahead:5.1.4) to the compose file, expose its HTTP port (e.g. 80:80), and optionally include an nginx service that proxies to it. Then adjust the exploit-client Dockerfile or script so that the exploit talks to the goahead endpoint (uploading a crafted file that injects LD_PRELOAD and triggers the malicious shared object) instead of mounting the host root; the script can use curl to POST the malicious payload to the goahead server’s upload URL. With those services defined and the exploit targeting the goahead container, the compose configuration will meet the milestones.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine base image can’t find the docker‑cli package (and curl isn’t installed either), so the apk add command aborts. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct client package and curl, e.g.: `RUN apk add --no-cache curl docker` (or add the community repository and install docker-cli if you prefer that name). After that the image will build successfully and the exploit script will be available at runtime.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because Alpine’s package repository does not contain a package named docker – the client binary is provided by the docker-cli package, so the apk add command aborts. Change the Dockerfile line that installs the tools from `apk add --no-cache curl docker` to `apk add --no-cache curl docker-cli`. After that the build proceeds, and the rest of the files (exploit.sh and the placeholder malicious.so) are copied unchanged. This single package‑name correction resolves the build error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Fix the build by correcting the Alpine package name and ensuring the exploit script is executable inside the container. Change the line in exploit-client/Dockerfile from `RUN apk add --no-cache curl docker-cli` to `RUN apk add --no-cache curl docker`. This installs the Docker client that is available in the Alpine repositories. Also add a `RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/exploit.sh` after copying the script (which you already have) and verify that the `malicious.so` file is present in the build context; if it is only a placeholder, replace it with a real binary or remove the copy to avoid a missing‑file error. Finally, confirm that the GoAhead image tag `embedthis/goahead:5.1.4` exists; if it does not, use the latest available tag (for example `embedthis/goahead:latest`) or pull the correct version from the registry. After these changes, `docker compose up --build` should complete without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because Alpine 3.14’s package repository no longer provides a “docker” package – the Docker client is now split into the “docker-cli” package, so the `apk add --no-cache curl docker` line results in “unable to locate package docker”. Change that line to install the CLI instead (for example `apk add --no-cache curl docker-cli`) and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged; the copied script and shared‑object will then be added correctly, the script will be marked executable, and the compose stack can start without the build error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based exploit client is trying to install a package that doesn’t exist in the 3.14 repositories and then copies a placeholder “.so” file that isn’t a real shared object; to fix it, change the Dockerfile to use a newer Alpine version (e.g., `alpine:3.18`) where the `docker-cli` package is available, or replace `docker-cli` with the correct package name (`docker`), and either remove the `COPY malicious.so` line or replace the placeholder with an actual compiled shared object (or simply omit the copy if you’re only demonstrating the upload). After those adjustments the image will build successfully and the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based exploit client image doesn’t actually contain the Docker client binary that the script expects (the “docker‑cli” package on Alpine only provides a tiny wrapper and pulls in a mismatched version, which breaks when the script later tries to talk to the remote daemon). The quickest fix is to base the client image on the official Docker image that already ships a working Docker client (for example `FROM docker:20.10.7` instead of `alpine:3.18`) or, if you want to stay on Alpine, add the full Docker package (`apk add --no-cache docker`) and ensure the client binary is in the PATH. After switching the base image (or installing the proper Docker client) the `COPY` and `chmod` steps work unchanged and the compose‑up will succeed.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile expects a compiled malicious.so binary but the repository only contains a plain‑text placeholder, and the base docker:20.10.7 image does not include the tools needed to compile a shared object; to fix this, either replace the copy of malicious.so with a pre‑built binary or add a build step that installs the necessary compiler (e.g., apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev ) and compiles a minimal C source file into malicious.so before copying it into the image, and then ensure the exploit.sh script is marked executable (the existing chmod line is fine). Also verify that the COPY paths are correct relative to the Dockerfile so the files are actually found during the build. Once the placeholder is turned into a real shared object or removed, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
