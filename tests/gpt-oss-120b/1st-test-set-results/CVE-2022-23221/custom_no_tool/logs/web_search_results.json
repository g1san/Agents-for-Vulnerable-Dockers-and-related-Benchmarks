    "desc": "CVE-2022-23221 is a critical vulnerability in the H2 Database Console web application. The console accepts arbitrary JDBC connection strings without proper validation. An attacker can supply a crafted JDBC URL that includes the parameters `IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE`, `FORBID_CREATION=FALSE` and `INIT=RUNSCRIPT` pointing to a script hosted on a remote server. The `INIT=RUNSCRIPT` clause forces the console to execute the remote SQL script, which can create triggers or invoke functions that run Java, JavaScript, Ruby, or operating\u2011system commands on the host. Because the console is typically exposed on port 8082 and often runs without authentication, any unauthenticated network user can trigger the flaw and achieve full remote code execution on the underlying system. The vulnerability exists in all releases of the H2 Database Console prior to version 2.1.210. Mitigation is achieved by upgrading to version 2.1.210 or later, or by restricting network access to the console and enabling strong authentication.",
