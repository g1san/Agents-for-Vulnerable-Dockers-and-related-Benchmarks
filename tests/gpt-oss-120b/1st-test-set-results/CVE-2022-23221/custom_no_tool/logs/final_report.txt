CVE description: CVE-2022-23221 is a critical vulnerability in the H2 Database Console web application. The console accepts arbitrary JDBC connection strings without proper validation. An attacker can supply a crafted JDBC URL that includes the parameters `IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE`, `FORBID_CREATION=FALSE` and `INIT=RUNSCRIPT` pointing to a script hosted on a remote server. The `INIT=RUNSCRIPT` clause forces the console to execute the remote SQL script, which can create triggers or invoke functions that run Java, JavaScript, Ruby, or operating‑system commands on the host. Because the console is typically exposed on port 8082 and often runs without authentication, any unauthenticated network user can trigger the flaw and achieve full remote code execution on the underlying system. The vulnerability exists in all releases of the H2 Database Console prior to version 2.1.210. Mitigation is achieved by upgrading to version 2.1.210 or later, or by restricting network access to the console and enabling strong authentication.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker image and compose file only reference the 'docker:20.10.8' image. No 'h2database/h2' image is used, so the required H2 versions cannot be satisfied. Additionally, neither 'h2database/h2' nor 'openjdk' services appear in the compose configuration, therefore the 'services_ok' milestone is not met.
	- ERROR: The provided Docker image and compose file only reference the 'docker:20.10.8' image. No 'h2database/h2' image is used, so the required H2 versions cannot be satisfied. Additionally, neither 'h2database/h2' nor 'openjdk' services appear in the compose configuration, therefore the 'services_ok' milestone is not met.
	- FIX: To meet the milestone you must add a service that runs the vulnerable H2 Console image, for example a service called h2_console that uses h2database/h2:1.4.200 or any of the listed pre‑2.1.210 tags, and expose its web UI port 8082. Include the OpenJDK runtime by either using the H2 image (which already contains the JRE) or adding a separate openjdk service if you need a custom JRE, and remove the unnecessary privileged Docker daemon container or keep it only if you still need host‑level Docker access. The revised compose file should therefore contain both the existing privileged vulnerable_engine service and a new h2_console service with appropriate ports, volumes and environment variables so that the H2 console is reachable and the required versions are satisfied.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because the `command` for the H2 service is written as a free‑form multiline block, which Docker Compose parses incorrectly, and because the init script is never actually handed to the server. To fix it, replace the multiline `command: >` block with a proper JSON‑array syntax that lists each argument separately (for example `command: ["java","-cp","/opt/h2*.jar","org.h2.tools.Server","-web","-webAllowOthers","-tcp","-tcpAllowOthers","-ifNotExists","-baseDir","/data","-properties","/data/h2.properties"]`). Then add the `-init` flag pointing at the mounted script (e.g. `-init","/data/init.sql"`). Finally, make sure the `init.sql` file is reachable at the relative path you mounted (or use an absolute host path) and consider pulling a patched H2 image (≥ 2.1.210) or at least updating the `H2_OPTIONS` variable to match the new command layout. After these changes the compose file will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the vulnerable_engine service is based on the plain Docker CLI image (`docker:20.10.8`), which does not contain a Docker daemon, so when Compose tries to start the container and expose port 2375 it cannot find the `dockerd` binary to run; swapping the image for a proper Docker‑in‑Docker image (for example `docker:20.10.8-dind` or simply `docker:dind`) resolves the problem, and you can keep the rest of the definition unchanged – the DIND image will launch the daemon automatically, honor the `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` setting to disable TLS, and still allow the socket bind‑mount and privileged mode you need. After changing the image tag, re‑run `docker compose up` and the compose file should build and start without errors.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the H2 server command line does not understand the `-init /data/init.sql` option – it expects a “RUNSCRIPT FROM …” clause rather than a plain file path – and because the relative bind‑mount `./init.sql` may not resolve correctly when Docker Compose builds the service. To fix it, change the bind‑mount to an absolute host path (for example `${PWD}/init.sql:/data/init.sql:ro`) so the file is guaranteed to be found, and replace the `-init /data/init.sql` argument with a proper H2‑compatible init clause such as `-init "RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"`. After updating the `command` line to something like  

```yaml
command: ["java","-cp","/opt/h2*.jar","org.h2.tools.Server","-web","-webAllowOthers","-tcp","-tcpAllowOthers","-ifNotExists","-baseDir","/data","-properties","/data/h2.properties","-init","RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"]
```  

the compose file will build and start without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the H2 Server command line is malformed – the ‑init option must receive the whole script clause as a single argument, and the path to the init file should be referenced in a way Docker can resolve it inside the container. Change the command line for h2_console to quote the init clause (for example ‑init "RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'") and mount the script with a relative host path (e.g. ‑ ${PWD}/init.sql:/data/init.sql:ro or simply ./init.sql:/data/init.sql:ro) so the file exists at /data/init.sql when the container starts. After correcting the command syntax and ensuring the script is correctly mounted, docker‑compose up will build and run both services without the previous error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the H2 service is started with a command that does not match the layout of the official h2database/h2 image – the jar location, the syntax of the ‑init option and the reference to a properties file that isn’t provided all cause the container to abort during start‑up. To fix it, change the command to use the exact jar path (for example `/opt/h2*.jar` expanded inside quotes), drop the reference to the non‑existent /data/h2.properties file, and pass the init script with the correct H2 syntax. A working command line looks like:

```yaml
command: >
  java -cp "/opt/h2*.jar"
  org.h2.tools.Server
  -web -webAllowOthers
  -tcp -tcpAllowOthers
  -ifNotExists
  -baseDir /data
  -init RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'
```

Make sure the init.sql file is mounted into `/data/init.sql` as you already do, and remove the ‑properties argument (or create a proper h2.properties file if you really need it). After these adjustments the H2 container starts correctly and the compose stack can be brought up without errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the `init.sql` file is being mounted with a relative path that Docker can’t resolve when the stack is started, and the H2 server command splits the `-init` argument into two separate tokens, which the H2 binary does not recognise. To fix it, change the volume line to use an absolute (or `${PWD}`‑expanded) path so the file is guaranteed to exist inside the container, and combine the `-init` flag and its argument into a single string. For example, replace  

```yaml
- ./init.sql:/data/init.sql:ro
```  

with  

```yaml
- ${PWD}/init.sql:/data/init.sql:ro
```  

and adjust the command list so the last two entries become  

```yaml
- "-init"
- "RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"
```  

(or simply `-init "RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"` as one element). After these changes the compose file will bring up both services without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the `command` section for `h2_console` is not written in a form the H2 image can actually execute – the `-init` flag expects a single argument containing the whole `RUNSCRIPT …` clause, and the class‑path glob (`/opt/h2*.jar`) isn’t expanded when the command is supplied as a list. To fix it, replace the multi‑line `command` with a single‑string invocation that points to the concrete jar file and quotes the full init clause, for example:

```yaml
command: >
  java -cp /opt/h2*.jar
  org.h2.tools.Server
  -web -webAllowOthers
  -tcp -tcpAllowOthers
  -ifNotExists
  -baseDir /data
  -init "RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"
```

(You can also use `-cp /opt/h2.jar` if you know the exact filename.) This ensures the H2 server starts with the init script correctly loaded and eliminates the build‑time error. Additionally, make sure `${PWD}` is resolved (or replace it with `./`) so that `init.sql` is mounted properly. Once those changes are applied, `docker compose up` should run without crashing.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the `command` for the h2_console service is written as a multiline string that Docker interprets as a single argument, breaking the Java launch line (the wildcard in `-cp /opt/h2*.jar` never expands and the `-init` option is passed literally). To fix it, replace the multiline block with a single‑line command or, better, use the exec‑form array so each token is passed separately. For example:

```yaml
command: ["java","-cp","/opt/h2*.jar","org.h2.tools.Server","-web","-webAllowOthers","-tcp","-tcpAllowOthers","-ifNotExists","-baseDir","/data","-init","RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"]
```

If you still prefer the shell form, collapse it to one line and escape the inner quotes:

```yaml
command: >-
  java -cp /opt/h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server -web -webAllowOthers -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -ifNotExists -baseDir /data -init "RUNSCRIPT FROM '/data/init.sql'"
```

Additionally, the image you are pulling (`h2database/h2:1.4.200`) is the vulnerable version referenced in CVE‑2022‑23221. Upgrade to a patched release, e.g. `h2database/h2:2.1.210` (or newer), and adjust the `-cp` path if the JAR location changes (the newer images place the jar under `/opt/h2*.jar` as well, so the same command works). After updating the image tag and using the exec‑form command, Docker Compose will start the container without the build‑time error and the H2 console will run with the initialization script correctly applied.
