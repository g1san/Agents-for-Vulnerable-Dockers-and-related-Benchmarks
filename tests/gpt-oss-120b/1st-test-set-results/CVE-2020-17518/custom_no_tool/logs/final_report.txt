CVE description: CVE‑2020‑17518 is an arbitrary file write vulnerability in Apache Flink's REST API. The vulnerable component is `org.apache.flink.runtime.rest.FileUploadHandler`, which resolves the uploaded filename without sanitising path information. An attacker can include path‑traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in the filename, causing Flink to write the uploaded file to any location writable by the Flink process, such as the system temporary directory. By uploading a malicious JAR and then invoking it through Flink's job‑submission endpoint, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the host. The flaw affects all Flink releases that include the REST handler introduced in version 1.5.1 and is fixed starting with version 1.11.3.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/flink][['1.5.1', '1.5.2', '1.5.3', '1.5.4', '1.5.5', '1.6.0', '1.6.1', '1.6.2', '1.6.3', '1.6.4', '1.6.5', '1.7.0', '1.7.1', '1.7.2', '1.7.3', '1.8.0', '1.8.1', '1.8.2', '1.9.0', '1.9.1', '1.9.2', '1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.11.0', '1.11.1', '1.11.2']] Apache Flink provides the REST endpoint that contains the vulnerable FileUploadHandler. Running a vulnerable Flink version is essential to reproduce the arbitrary file write and remote code execution vulnerability.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup defines a web service built from a Node 14 Alpine base image and a PostgreSQL 12 Alpine database. No Apache Flink image or version appears in the Dockerfiles, the docker-compose.yml, or the `docker inspect` output. Therefore the required service apache/flink is not present (services_ok = false) and none of the listed vulnerable Flink versions are used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker setup defines a web service built from a Node 14 Alpine base image and a PostgreSQL 12 Alpine database. No Apache Flink image or version appears in the Dockerfiles, the docker-compose.yml, or the `docker inspect` output. Therefore the required service apache/flink is not present (services_ok = false) and none of the listed vulnerable Flink versions are used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch you need to add an Apache Flink service to the compose file that uses a non‑vulnerable release (for example flink:1.11.3‑scala_2.11) and configure it to run the REST endpoint, then adjust the web container to communicate with that Flink instance instead of the placeholder Node app. In practice you would replace the current “web” service with a Flink job‑manager and task‑manager definition, expose port 8081 for the REST API, and remove the custom “/vuln” route that relies on eval, since the intended vulnerability is now represented by the proper Flink image rather than a fabricated Node endpoint. This ensures the stack actually includes the vulnerable component you intend to test and lets you upgrade to the patched Flink version to eliminate CVE‑2020‑17518.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To get the compose stack running you need to make the job‑manager reachable by the task‑manager under the name used in `JOB_MANAGER_RPC_ADDRESS`. Add an explicit container name (or a hostname) for the job‑manager service and put both services on the same user‑defined network so Docker’s DNS can resolve the name; for example, add a `container_name: jobmanager` line under the jobmanager service and a `networks: [flink]` block for both services (creating the `flink` network at the bottom of the file). This ensures the `JOB_MANAGER_RPC_ADDRESS=jobmanager` environment variable resolves correctly and eliminates the build‑time failure caused by the unresolved host name.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to run the very old apache/flink:1.5.1 image, which is no longer available for many platforms (e.g., ARM) and the entry‑point for the job‑manager changed in later releases, so Docker aborts when it can’t pull or start the container. To fix the failure, replace the outdated image tag with a currently supported version (for example apache/flink:1.11.3 or later) and keep the same command arguments; this ensures the image can be pulled on all architectures and the entry‑point matches the service definitions, allowing the stack to start without build errors. If you must stay on the vulnerable 1.5.x line, explicitly pull the exact image first (`docker pull apache/flink:1.5.1`) on a compatible host or switch to a multi‑arch tag that still exists; otherwise upgrading the version is the simplest correction.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because it’s missing the mandatory `version` declaration that tells Docker‑Compose which schema to interpret, so the parser can’t correctly read the service definitions. Add a top‑level `version: "3"` (or a newer 3.x version) line right before the `services:` key, keep the existing indentation for the jobs, and the file will be valid again. You may also want to rename the `container_name` entry (or drop it) if you run multiple compose instances, but the critical fix is inserting the version field at the very top of the YAML. After that, `docker compose up` will pull the official Flink 1.11.2 images and start the jobmanager and taskmanager containers without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The failure is caused by the compose file referring to a custom image that isn’t being built – it only specifies `image: apache/flink:1.11.2` while the directory contains a Dockerfile meant to create a “custom_no_tool” image. To fix it, replace the `image:` line in both services with a `build:` section that points to the directory containing the Dockerfile (e.g., `build: ./../..`), or alternatively give the service a proper image name that matches an existing image in the registry. After adding the build context, run `docker compose up --build` so Docker can construct the image before launching the containers, which resolves the build‑time error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile in the custom_no_tool directory does not produce a usable image for the jobmanager service – it’s essentially empty (it only contains a FROM line and a commented‑out COPY), so when Docker tries to assemble the layers it cannot find any files to copy and the resulting image lacks the expected Flink layout, causing the container to exit immediately. To fix it, give the Dockerfile a minimal but complete definition: start from the vulnerable Flink base image, set the working directory to /opt/flink, copy any JAR or configuration files you actually need for the demo (or simply omit the COPY if you don’t have a file), and make sure the entry‑point script is preserved (the base image already provides the appropriate entry‑point, so you don’t need to override it). For example, adjust the Dockerfile to:

```
FROM apache/flink:1.11.2
WORKDIR /opt/flink
# If you have a JAR to include uncomment the next line and make sure the file exists
# COPY exploit.jar lib/
```

Then, in the docker‑compose.yml you can keep the build: . directive (it will now point to a valid Dockerfile) or, if you don’t need any custom layers at all, replace build: . with image: apache/flink:1.11.2 so Docker just pulls the image directly. After these changes the image builds successfully and the services start normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base image tag you’re referencing does not exist on Docker Hub – `apache/flink:1.11.2‑scala_2.11` is an invalid reference, so Docker cannot pull the layers needed to start the build. Change the `FROM` line to a tag that actually exists, such as `apache/flink:1.11.2-scala_2.11-java8` (or simply `apache/flink:1.11.2` if you don’t need a specific Scala version), then run the compose again; the image will pull correctly and the rest of the Dockerfile will build without error. If you later want to include the exploit JAR, just uncomment the `COPY exploit.jar lib/` line after the base image is fixed.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Docker‑Compose is trying to build the image from “.” while the Dockerfile actually lives in the custom_no_tool directory, so the context doesn’t contain the Dockerfile (or any files it references). Fix it by either moving the docker-compose.yml into the same folder as the Dockerfile or by changing each service’s build definition to point at the correct directory (for example build: ./custom_no_tool). Once the build context matches the location of the Dockerfile, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile does not contain any executable instruction after the comment line, so Docker cannot create a usable image for the jobmanager and taskmanager services; to fix it, add a valid entrypoint or CMD (for example `CMD ["jobmanager"]` for the jobmanager service and `CMD ["taskmanager"]` for the taskmanager), and either remove the commented‑out COPY line or make sure an exploit.jar file actually exists in the build context before uncommenting it. Additionally, verify that the compose file’s build: . directive points at the directory containing the corrected Dockerfile so the context is resolved correctly. Once the Dockerfile includes a runnable command and the optional copy target is valid, the images will build without error.
