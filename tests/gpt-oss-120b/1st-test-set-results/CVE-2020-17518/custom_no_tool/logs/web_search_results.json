    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201117518 is an arbitrary file write vulnerability in Apache Flink's REST API. The vulnerable component is `org.apache.flink.runtime.rest.FileUploadHandler`, which resolves the uploaded filename without sanitising path information. An attacker can include path\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\") in the filename, causing Flink to write the uploaded file to any location writable by the Flink process, such as the system temporary directory. By uploading a malicious JAR and then invoking it through Flink's job\u2011submission endpoint, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the host. The flaw affects all Flink releases that include the REST handler introduced in version 1.5.1 and is fixed starting with version 1.11.3.",
