{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-9086 is an arbitrary file read vulnerability affecting the GitLab import/export feature. When a project export archive is imported, GitLab reads the `VERSION` file and the `project.json` file from the archive without validating symbolic links. An attacker can craft an export archive where these files are symbolic links that point to any file on the server's filesystem (for example `/etc/passwd`). During the import process GitLab follows the symlink, opens the target file, and returns its contents (the first line for `VERSION` or the full content when JSON parsing fails for `project.json`) in the HTTP response. This allows any user who can import a project to read arbitrary files that are readable by the GitLab process, leading to disclosure of credentials, configuration files, SSH private keys, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability exists in GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition versions from 8.9.0 through 8.13.2. It was fixed in GitLab 8.13.3 and later by sanitizing the import archive and preventing symlink traversal.",
