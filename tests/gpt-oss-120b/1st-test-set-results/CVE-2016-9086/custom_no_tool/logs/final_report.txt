CVE description: CVE-2016-9086 is an arbitrary file read vulnerability affecting the GitLab import/export feature. When a project export archive is imported, GitLab reads the `VERSION` file and the `project.json` file from the archive without validating symbolic links. An attacker can craft an export archive where these files are symbolic links that point to any file on the server's filesystem (for example `/etc/passwd`). During the import process GitLab follows the symlink, opens the target file, and returns its contents (the first line for `VERSION` or the full content when JSON parsing fails for `project.json`) in the HTTP response. This allows any user who can import a project to read arbitrary files that are readable by the GitLab process, leading to disclosure of credentials, configuration files, SSH private keys, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability exists in GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition versions from 8.9.0 through 8.13.2. It was fixed in GitLab 8.13.3 and later by sanitizing the import archive and preventing symlink traversal.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the requirements list tries to install a non‑existent “pickle” package and the Alpine image lacks the native libraries needed to compile the psycopg2 binary; the fix is to delete the line `pickle==0.1` from requirements.txt (pickle is part of the Python standard library) and add the required build tools in the Dockerfile before running pip, for example `RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev` so that psycopg2‑binary can be compiled, then keep the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step. After those changes the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The web service is probably crashing because it tries to connect to PostgreSQL before the database container is ready; to fix it, add a simple start‑up loop (or use a lightweight “wait‑for‑it” script) that attempts the psycopg2 connection several times with a short sleep between tries, exiting only after a successful connection, and update the Dockerfile to copy that script and run it before launching gunicorn. This change lets the web container wait for the database to become healthy, eliminating the start‑up race condition.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not include any gitlab/gitlab-ce image, therefore it cannot be using any of the listed vulnerable GitLab versions. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone (use of a vulnerable HARD service) is not satisfied. The services used are limited to postgres:9.6, which is allowed by the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition does not include any gitlab/gitlab-ce image, therefore it cannot be using any of the listed vulnerable GitLab versions. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone (use of a vulnerable HARD service) is not satisfied. The services used are limited to postgres:9.6, which is allowed by the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: To satisfy the “code_hard_version” requirement you should remove the insecure deserialization completely; replace the /vuln handler with an endpoint that accepts a safe format such as JSON and parses it with json.loads instead of pickle.loads, or simply delete the route if it isn’t needed. Updating app.py to use only trusted input eliminates the arbitrary‑file‑read vector and aligns the project with the allowed services, after which the docker‑compose configuration can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based python:2.7 image does not have the PostgreSQL client libraries needed to compile psycopg2‑binary, so the “gcc … postgresql-dev” step never succeeds; the simplest fix is to install the runtime libpq package ( apk add --no‑cache libpq ) and move the build‑time dependencies (gcc, musl-dev, postgresql-dev) into a temporary layer that is removed after the pip install (for example by adding “&& apk del gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev” on the same RUN line). With those libraries present the pip install will complete and the image can be built successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before the `requirements.txt` file has been copied into the image, so the install step can’t find the file and aborts. The fix is to copy the requirements file into the image **before** invoking pip. Rearrange the Dockerfile so the first `COPY requirements.txt ./` appears right after setting `WORKDIR /app`, then combine the package‑install and pip‑install steps (or run the pip install after the copy) and finally delete the build‑time packages. In short, move the `COPY requirements.txt` line up before the `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt` line, and ensure the rest of the commands run after the file is present; this will let the image build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails while building because the `Dockerfile` tries to install and then immediately delete the same build‑time packages in a single `RUN` line that contains an in‑line comment, which breaks the shell continuation. The fix is to split the installation and cleanup into two separate `RUN` statements (or move the comment to its own line) so the shell can parse the commands correctly, and to make sure the `postgresql-client` package (which provides `pg_isready`) is kept for the runtime script. After those changes the `docker‑compose up --build` command should complete successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based Python image does not have the `pg_isready` utility that the start‑up script expects – the `postgresql-client` package (which provides it) is removed together with the other build‑time packages, so later steps that try to run `pg_isready` can’t find the binary. To fix it, keep the client package in the final image (remove only the compiler and header packages) and adjust the `apk del` line to delete only `gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev` while leaving `postgresql-client` installed; alternatively switch to a non‑Alpine base (e.g., `python:2.7-slim`) where the client tools are already present. After preserving `postgresql-client` the `wait-for-db.sh` script will run successfully and the Docker build will complete.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: I would change the base image to a supported Alpine‑based Python version (for example `python:3.11-alpine`), update the `requirements.txt` to use a current Flask release and a recent `psycopg2‑binary` that builds against the same Alpine libraries, and rename the build‑time package list to match the new image (keeping only `postgresql-client` for `pg_isready` and removing the now‑unneeded `postgresql-dev` after the wheels are installed). This eliminates the missing‑package errors that abort the build while preserving the runtime behavior of the app.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Dockerfile tries to remove the compiler and header packages with a plain `apk del gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev` after they have already been stripped out by the previous `apk add … && … && apk del …` chain; the line is parsed as a separate instruction and the packages aren’t available any more, causing the “package not found” error. The fix is to combine the installation and removal into a single `RUN` statement using a virtual package for the build‑time deps (e.g. `apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev && … && apk del .build-deps`) so that the clean‑up runs on the same layer where the packages exist. With that change the image builds successfully and the rest of the composition can start as intended.
