    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u20111974 is a critical vulnerability in the Ingress\u202fNGINX controller used in Kubernetes clusters. The controller runs a validating admission webhook that checks incoming resources. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the pod network can send a crafted resource that bypasses the webhook validation and triggers execution of attacker\u2011controlled commands inside the controller process. Because the controller is typically granted cluster\u2011wide permission to read Secrets, the attacker can also exfiltrate any Secret stored in the cluster, including TLS certificates, service account tokens, and database credentials. The vulnerability is present in all Ingress\u202fNGINX controller releases prior to version 1.11.5 and in several early 1.11 and 1.12 releases. Exploitation requires only network\u2011level access to the pod network; no Kubernetes credentials or prior compromise are needed. Successful exploitation results in full code execution in the controller\u2019s context and potential disclosure of all cluster Secrets, representing a complete takeover of the cluster.",
