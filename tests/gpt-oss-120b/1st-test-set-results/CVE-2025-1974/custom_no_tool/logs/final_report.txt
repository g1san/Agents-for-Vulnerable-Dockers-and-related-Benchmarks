CVE description: CVE‑2025‑1974 is a critical vulnerability in the Ingress NGINX controller used in Kubernetes clusters. The controller runs a validating admission webhook that checks incoming resources. An unauthenticated attacker who can reach the pod network can send a crafted resource that bypasses the webhook validation and triggers execution of attacker‑controlled commands inside the controller process. Because the controller is typically granted cluster‑wide permission to read Secrets, the attacker can also exfiltrate any Secret stored in the cluster, including TLS certificates, service account tokens, and database credentials. The vulnerability is present in all Ingress NGINX controller releases prior to version 1.11.5 and in several early 1.11 and 1.12 releases. Exploitation requires only network‑level access to the pod network; no Kubernetes credentials or prior compromise are needed. Successful exploitation results in full code execution in the controller’s context and potential disclosure of all cluster Secrets, representing a complete takeover of the cluster.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only two services: 'webapp' (built from php:7.4-apache) and 'db' (mysql:5.7). Neither service uses the 'ingress-nginx/controller' image, and no version of that service is present in the inspected images. Consequently, the required service is missing (services_ok = false) and there is no version to validate against the allowed list (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only two services: 'webapp' (built from php:7.4-apache) and 'db' (mysql:5.7). Neither service uses the 'ingress-nginx/controller' image, and no version of that service is present in the inspected images. Consequently, the required service is missing (services_ok = false) and there is no version to validate against the allowed list (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To resolve the missing ingress‑nginx/controller service, add a new service entry in the docker‑compose file that pulls the hardened image (for example ingress-nginx/controller:1.11.5 or later) and expose the required ports (typically 80/443); then configure it to watch the webapp namespace by mounting the controller’s configuration and certificates as needed. Update the compose version to include this service alongside webapp and db, and ensure the image tag meets the allowed‑list version so the validation logic can recognize the service as present and compliant. Once the controller service is declared with a safe version, the composition will satisfy the “services_ok” and “code_hard_version” checks.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the `ingress-nginx` service trying to run a command that contains an unresolved shell variable – `$(POD_NAMESPACE)` – which Docker does not expand inside a JSON‑style `command` array, so the container crashes before it even starts. To fix it, replace the array syntax with a plain string (or a shell wrapper) that lets the variable be interpolated, for example: `command: /bin/sh -c "/nginx-ingress-controller --publish-service=${POD_NAMESPACE}/ingress-nginx --election-id=ingress-controller-leader --controller-class=k8s.io/ingress-nginx"`. After this change the `ingress-nginx` container will start correctly and the compose build will complete without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file points the webapp service at `./webapp` while the Dockerfile and source code are actually located in `./webapp/Dockerfile` and `./webapp/src/` relative to the compose file’s directory, so Docker cannot find the Dockerfile in the expected location. To fix it, change the webapp service’s build directive to explicitly reference the Dockerfile by using `build: { context: ./webapp, dockerfile: Dockerfile }` (or simply move the Dockerfile up one level so it sits directly in `./webapp`). Additionally, the MySQL service mounts `./db/init.sql`, but the actual file lives in `./db/init.sql` relative to the compose file, so ensure that path is correct or adjust it to `./custom_no_tool/db/init.sql` if the compose file is deeper in the directory hierarchy. After correcting the build context and any mismatched volume source paths, the images will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ingress‑nginx image you reference ( ingress‑nginx/controller:v1.11.4 ) is no longer available in the Docker registry; the vulnerable tag was removed after the fix was released. Update the compose file to pull a version that actually exists (for example ingress‑nginx/controller:v1.11.5 or any newer release) and, if you still want to demonstrate the vulnerability, keep the same command line. After changing the image tag the webapp and db images build without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP base image tag you’re using (php:7.4‑apache) has been removed from Docker Hub, so Docker can’t find it; change the Dockerfile to reference a currently available tag such as php:7.4‑apache‑buster (or php:8.2‑apache if you’re willing to upgrade) and the image will pull correctly. At the same time make sure the COPY line points to the right directory – since the build context is ./webapp, COPY src/ … works only if the src folder really lives under ./webapp; if it’s elsewhere, adjust the path or move the folder so the copy succeeds. Finally, the ingress‑nginx image tag v1.11.5 may not exist in the public registry; switch it to a tag that is known to be published (for example ingress‑nginx/controller:v1.11.6 or the latest stable release) and the compose file will start without “image not found” errors. After those two changes the images should build and the stack will launch.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile is trying to copy a directory that doesn’t exist in the build context and because the base image `php:7.4‑apache‑buster` is no longer supported, which causes the underlying package manager to error out during the image creation. To fix it, change the `FROM` line to a current, supported PHP‑Apache image (for example `php:8.2-apache` or simply `php:7.4-apache` if you need that version) and make sure the `src/` folder is placed directly inside the `webapp` directory so that the `COPY src/ /var/www/html/` instruction can find it. After updating the base image and confirming the folder structure, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the compose file’s relative paths not matching the directory from which you invoke docker‑compose, so the Docker daemon cannot find the webapp source folder (and consequently the Dockerfile) when it resolves ./webapp relative to the compose file’s location. To fix it, add a top‑level version (e.g. ‘3.8’) to the compose file and rewrite the build section to use an absolute or correctly‑scoped path – for example, change build: {context: ./webapp, dockerfile: Dockerfile} to build: {context: ${PWD}/custom_no_tool/webapp, dockerfile: Dockerfile} or simply move the compose file into the custom_no_tool directory so that ./webapp points to the actual folder. Once the context points to the real source tree, the image will build without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The ingress‑nginx service is failing because the controller binary is built to run inside a Kubernetes pod and expects the Kubernetes control‑plane (API server, admission webhook configuration, leader‑election ConfigMap, etc.) to be present; in a plain Docker‑Compose stack those components are missing, so the process crashes on start‑up. The quickest fix is to replace the Kubernetes‑specific image with a regular reverse‑proxy that can run standalone – for example switch the image to a plain nginx image (e.g., nginx:stable) and configure it to forward traffic to the webapp container, or use the “ingress‑nginx/controller‑alpine” image together with the “--disable-admission-webhook” flag so it no longer tries to talk to the API server. Update the docker‑compose.yml ingress‑nginx service to use the new image and adjust the command line accordingly (remove the leader‑election and publish‑service flags, keep only “/nginx-ingress-controller --configmap=default/ingress-nginx‑controller‑config”). After rebuilding and restarting the stack the ingress container will start correctly and the rest of the system will work.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that’s failing is the ingress‑nginx service – you’re pulling a plain nginx:stable image, which never runs the Kubernetes Ingress controller or the validating webhook that the demo expects, so it can’t start correctly and won’t proxy to the web app. Switch the image to the official Ingress‑NGINX controller (e.g. k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller:latest or registry.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5), add the required command‑line flags (like `/nginx-ingress-controller --publish-service=$(POD_NAMESPACE)/ingress-nginx --election-id=ingress-controller-leader`) and mount the controller’s config map if needed. After updating the image and command lines in docker‑compose.yml the service will start, resolve webapp by its service name, and the whole stack will run as intended.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines an "ingress-nginx" service that builds a custom image FROM "nginx:stable" (NGINX 1.28.0), not the official "ingress-nginx/controller" image. Therefore the required service "ingress-nginx/controller" is not present, causing services_ok to be false. Because the official controller image is not used, no version from the listed vulnerable set (v1.10.x, v1.11.x, v1.12.0) is deployed, so code_hard_version is also false.
