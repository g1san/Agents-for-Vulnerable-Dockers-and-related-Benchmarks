{
    "desc": "CVE-2020-9402 is a SQL injection vulnerability in Django's GeoDjango aggregation and spatial lookup code. When Django is configured to use an Oracle database backend, the `tolerance` parameter supplied to several GIS functions and aggregates is inserted directly into the generated SQL statement without proper sanitisation. An attacker who can control this parameter can inject arbitrary Oracle SQL, allowing execution of malicious queries that may read, modify, or delete data in the database. The flaw exists in Django 1.11 series before version 1.11.29, in Django 2.2 series before version 2.2.11, and in Django 3.0 series before version 3.0.4. It is mitigated by upgrading to Django 1.11.29, 2.2.11, 3.0.4 or later, or by validating and sanitising any user\u2011controlled input before it is passed to GIS functions.",
