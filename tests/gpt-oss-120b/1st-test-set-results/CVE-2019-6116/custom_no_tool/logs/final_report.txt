----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2019‑6116 is a critical vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter that allows an attacker who can supply a crafted PostScript or PDF file to bypass the built‑in SAFER sandbox. The flaw resides in the handling of transient (ephemeral) procedures and certain internal operators, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. This results in full system compromise, including the ability to read or write arbitrary files and to perform privilege escalation if Ghostscript runs with elevated rights.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][artifex/ghostscript][['9.00', '9.01', '9.02', '9.03', '9.04', '9.05', '9.06', '9.07', '9.08', '9.09', '9.10', '9.11', '9.12', '9.13', '9.14', '9.15', '9.16', '9.17', '9.18', '9.19', '9.20', '9.21', '9.22', '9.23', '9.24', '9.25', '9.26']] Core Ghostscript interpreter that contains the vulnerable code paths; used to process PDF/PS files without the -dSAFER flag, exposing the remote code execution flaw.
- [SOFT-BASE][alpine][['3.12']] Lightweight Linux distribution used as the base image to run Ghostscript; provides the necessary runtime environment and package manager for installing and executing Ghostscript.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile is based on alpine:3.12 and installs a vulnerable Docker CLI (18.09.7) and Flask, but it never pulls or installs the artifex/ghostscript image, nor does it reference any ghostscript binary. Therefore the image does not contain the required services ['artifex/ghostscript', 'alpine']; the 'artifex/ghostscript' service is missing, causing services_ok to be false. Since no artifex/ghostscript version is used at all, the image cannot be using any of the listed vulnerable ghostscript versions (9.00‑9.26), so code_hard_version is also false.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile is based on alpine:3.12 and installs a vulnerable Docker CLI (18.09.7) and Flask, but it never pulls or installs the artifex/ghostscript image, nor does it reference any ghostscript binary. Therefore the image does not contain the required services ['artifex/ghostscript', 'alpine']; the 'artifex/ghostscript' service is missing, causing services_ok to be false. Since no artifex/ghostscript version is used at all, the image cannot be using any of the listed vulnerable ghostscript versions (9.00‑9.26), so code_hard_version is also false.
	- FIX: To make the composition satisfy the required services you need to add the Ghostscript interpreter to the vulnerable container and ensure it is a version that falls inside the vulnerable 9.00‑9.26 range. The simplest approach is to replace the plain Alpine base with the official artifex/ghostscript image (for example artifex/ghostscript:9.22‑alpine) and then install the Flask application on top of it, keeping the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged except for the FROM line. If you prefer to stay on Alpine you can install Ghostscript from the Alpine repositories, pin the package to a specific vulnerable version (e.g., apk add ghostscript=9.22-r0), and expose the binary in the PATH so the Flask app can invoke it. After adding the Ghostscript package and confirming the version, the service list will contain both artifex/ghostscript and alpine, making services_ok and code_hard_version evaluate to true.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install a pre‑compiled Docker client on top of an Alpine‑based Ghostscript image that does not have the basic build tools (like `tar` with GNU extensions) and the expected directory layout, which causes the `tar … -C /usr/local/bin --strip‑components=1 docker/docker` step to error out. To fix it, restructure the Dockerfile so the Alpine package manager handles everything you need: first install `python3`, `py3-pip`, `curl`, and `tar` in a single `apk add` line, then download and extract the Docker binary into `/usr/local/bin` (creating the directory if it does not exist), and finally clean up the temporary files. Also, move the `apk del curl tar` to the end of the `RUN` so the tools are still available when the extraction runs. After that, the rest of the layers (copying the app, setting the entrypoint, exposing the port) will build without error. This change keeps the same functionality but eliminates the “file or directory not found” error that stops the image build.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Alpine 3.12 package repository does not contain the exact “ghostscript=9.22‑r0” version you are pinning, so apk cannot satisfy the request; the quickest fix is to drop the version pin and let apk install the default ghostscript package that ships with Alpine 3.12 (or add the appropriate testing repository if you really need that exact release). After that change, the Docker‑CLI tar extraction should also be adjusted to point to the correct binary path – using `tar -xzvf /tmp/docker.tgz -C /usr/local/bin --strip-components=1 docker/docker` works, but you may want to verify the archive layout or simply copy the extracted `docker` binary with `mv /usr/local/bin/docker/docker /usr/local/bin/docker && rm -rf /usr/local/bin/docker`. With the version‑pin removed (or corrected) and the Docker binary placed correctly, the Dockerfile will run without errors and the container will start as expected.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image does not have a trusted certificate store, so the curl download of the Docker binary is rejected and the tar step aborts. Add the CA‑certificates package (and optionally upgrade the index) before fetching Docker, then the rest of the Dockerfile works unchanged. In practice you only need to change the first RUN line to something like `apk update && apk add --no-cache ca-certificates python3 py3-pip curl tar && update-ca-certificates` before the curl command. This gives curl a valid trust store, lets the Docker binary download succeed, and the image builds correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the manual download of the static Docker binary pulls a glibc‑linked binary into an Alpine (musl) environment, causing missing library errors; replace that step with the Alpine package manager’s native Docker client (apk add docker-cli) and add libc6‑compat if you really need the static binary. Also, the entrypoint script should exec the Flask process instead of background‑ing it and then tail‑ing /dev/null, so change the script to run “exec python3 /app/app.py” and drop the tail line; this way the container’s main PID is the Flask app and the image builds and runs cleanly. Finally, make sure the Dockerfile’s apk line includes “libc6-compat” (or removes the curl/tar steps) and that the entrypoint script is still marked executable. These small tweaks resolve the build‑time error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine package list includes names that don’t exist in the default repositories – `docker-cli` and `libc6-compat` are not provided by the Alpine base used in the Ghostscript image. Edit the Dockerfile to remove those two packages and, if you need Docker client functionality, install the `docker` package instead (or pull the Docker binary from the official Docker releases). A corrected RUN line would be something like:

```
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache ca-certificates python3 py3-pip curl tar docker && \
    update-ca-certificates && \
    pip3 install flask
```

After this change the image should build successfully, and the rest of the setup (working directory, copied files, entrypoint) can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build probably fails because the Alpine base you’re using doesn’t provide a package called `docker` – the client binary is in the `docker-cli` package, and trying to install a non‑existent package aborts the `apk add` step. To fix it, change the `apk add` line in the Dockerfile to install `docker-cli` (or omit the Docker client entirely if you don’t need it) and keep the rest of the steps unchanged; then the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based Ghostscript image does not contain the “docker‑cli” package name you’re asking for, so the `apk add` line aborts and the rest of the Dockerfile never runs. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct Docker client package (simply “docker” on Alpine) and, to avoid any other missing‑dependency problems, add the Python wheel package before pip installs Flask. In practice you would replace the `apk add … docker-cli` segment with `apk add --no‑cache ca-certificates python3 py3-pip curl tar docker` and insert `apk add --no‑cache py3-wheel` (or just rely on the `docker` meta‑package) before the `pip3 install flask` line. After that adjustment the image builds successfully and the rest of the stack can start.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine package list does not contain a plain “docker” package – the Docker client is provided by the `docker-cli` package – and the Ghostscript image tag you referenced (`artifex/ghostscript:9.25-alpine`) does not exist in the public registry, causing the base stage to abort. To fix it, change the `FROM` line to a valid Ghostscript image such as `artifex/ghostscript:9.25` (or pull the Alpine Ghostscript package from the official Alpine repo) and replace `apk add … docker …` with `apk add --no-cache docker-cli` so the Docker client is installed correctly; after these two changes the image should build without errors.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
