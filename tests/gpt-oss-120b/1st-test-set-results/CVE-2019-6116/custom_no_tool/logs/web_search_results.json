    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116116 is a critical vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter that allows an attacker who can supply a crafted PostScript or PDF file to bypass the built\u2011in SAFER sandbox. The flaw resides in the handling of transient (ephemeral) procedures and certain internal operators, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. This results in full system compromise, including the ability to read or write arbitrary files and to perform privilege escalation if Ghostscript runs with elevated rights.",
