    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20115254 is a critical unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x. The broker accepts JMS ObjectMessage payloads and deserializes them without restricting the classes that can be instantiated. An attacker who can connect to the ActiveMQ OpenWire port (default TCP 61616) or the HTTP/REST API can send a crafted serialized Java object containing a gadget chain (for example the Commons Collections or ROME gadget). When the broker deserializes this object it executes attacker\u2011controlled code inside the JVM process, resulting in remote code execution with the privileges of the ActiveMQ service. The flaw exists in all ActiveMQ releases prior to version 5.13.0. Exploitation requires only network access to the broker; no authentication is required on the OpenWire protocol. The vulnerability was fixed in ActiveMQ 5.13.0 by disabling the insecure deserialization path and adding class\u2011trust configuration.",
