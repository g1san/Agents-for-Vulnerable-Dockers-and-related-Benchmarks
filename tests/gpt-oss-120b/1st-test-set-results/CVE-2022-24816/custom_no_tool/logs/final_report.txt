CVE description: CVE‑2022‑24816 is a critical code‑injection vulnerability in the Jt‑Jiffle extension of the Java Advanced Imaging Extensions (JAI‑EXT) library that is bundled with GeoServer. The extension receives Jiffle scripts via the Web Processing Service (WPS) endpoint (`/geoserver/wms` or `/geoserver/wps`). The script text is inserted into a generated Java source file inside a Javadoc comment and then compiled at runtime with the Janino compiler. Because the comment is not properly escaped, an attacker can break out of the comment block, inject arbitrary Java code, and cause Janino to compile and load a malicious class. The malicious class can execute arbitrary operating‑system commands in a static initializer (for example by redefining `java.lang.Double`). The exploit requires no authentication and works against any GeoServer deployment that includes the Jt‑Jiffle extension with a vulnerable version of the `jt‑jiffle` library (all versions prior to 1.1.22). Successful exploitation gives the attacker remote code execution with the privileges of the GeoServer process, allowing full control of the host system.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][geoserver][['2.16.2', '2.17.0', '2.17.1', '2.17.2', '2.18.0', '2.19.0']] GeoServer Docker image that bundles the vulnerable jt‑jiffle library (versions of jt‑jiffle earlier than 1.1.22 are included in these GeoServer releases). This service provides the WPS endpoint where malicious Jiffle scripts can be submitted, triggering the code‑injection vulnerability.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['15-alpine']] Relational database used by GeoServer for storing configuration and metadata. Required for a fully functional GeoServer instance but not directly related to the vulnerability.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Flask container is crashing because the Python image does not have the PostgreSQL client libraries required to install psycopg2, so the import fails at start‑up; add a layer in the Dockerfile that installs the build tools and libpq‑dev packages (or simply use psycopg2‑binary) before running pip install and then reinstall the Flask dependency, for example:

```
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc libpq-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN pip install Flask==2.0.1 psycopg2-binary
COPY app.py .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python","app.py"]
```

With the required database driver present the app can connect to the db service and the compose stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but the logs consist solely of repeated "Waiting for db:5432..." messages. The wait‑for‑it script has not been able to connect to the database, so the main application (python app.py) has not started. This indicates the container is not operating correctly (it is blocked waiting for a dependent service).
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running, but the logs consist solely of repeated "Waiting for db:5432..." messages. The wait‑for‑it script has not been able to connect to the database, so the main application (python app.py) has not started. This indicates the container is not operating correctly (it is blocked waiting for a dependent service).
	- FIX: The problem is that the wait‑for‑it.sh script relies on the nc (netcat) command to probe the database port, but the python:3.9‑slim image does not include netcat, so the loop never succeeds and the Flask app never starts. Adding netcat (or replacing the check with a tool that is already present, such as pg_isready) to the image resolves the issue; for example, modify the Dockerfile to install netcat with apt‑get install -y netcat‑openbsd or change the script to call pg_isready instead of nc. After the probe can succeed, the script will exec python app.py and the container will run normally.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines two services: vulnerable_app (custom) and db based on the postgres:13-alpine image. No geoserver service is present, therefore the required services list ['geoserver','postgres'] is not fully satisfied – the geoserver component is missing, causing services_ok to be false. Additionally, because geoserver is not used, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable geoserver versions list, so the code does not use a vulnerable 'HARD' service version, resulting in code_hard_version being false.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines two services: vulnerable_app (custom) and db based on the postgres:13-alpine image. No geoserver service is present, therefore the required services list ['geoserver','postgres'] is not fully satisfied – the geoserver component is missing, causing services_ok to be false. Additionally, because geoserver is not used, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable geoserver versions list, so the code does not use a vulnerable 'HARD' service version, resulting in code_hard_version being false.
	- FIX: Add a geoserver service to the compose file that matches the “HARD” service definition – for example use the official docker.io/geoserver:2.17.2 image (or any of the listed vulnerable releases) and expose its WPS endpoint (port 8080 or 8081). Declare the service name geoserver so the validator can find it, and optionally add a healthcheck that waits for the WPS URL to become reachable. Then keep the existing db service unchanged; the compose will now contain both required services, the version of geoserver will be recognized as vulnerable, and services_ok will evaluate to true. No further code changes are needed beyond inserting this service definition.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Python psycopg2 binary wheels cannot be compiled on the slim image – the required header files and a C compiler are not present. To fix it, extend the Dockerfile so that the image installs the development packages needed for building psycopg2 (for example python3-dev and gcc plus libpq-dev) before running pip install, and clean the apt cache afterwards. Also make sure the wait‑for‑it.sh script is copied into the container with the correct line endings (use dos2unix or add RUN dos2unix wait‑for‑it.sh) so that the final CMD doesn’t abort due to a script syntax error. After adding the missing dev packages and ensuring the script is executable with Unix line endings, the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the compose file uses the **condition** key under `depends_on`, which is only valid in version 2.x of the Compose format; with the default (or a version‑3 file) Docker Compose rejects that attribute and aborts the startup. Change the file to a version 2.x schema (for example add `version: "2.4"` at the top) or simply drop the `condition:` lines and let the application’s own wait‑for‑it script handle service readiness. Additionally, the healthcheck for the geoserver service calls `curl`, which isn’t included in the official Geoserver image, causing the healthcheck to fail and the container to be marked unhealthy. Replace the healthcheck command with a tool that is present (e.g., `wget --spider http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wps`) or create a thin wrapper image that installs curl and use that instead. With these two adjustments the Docker Compose stack will build and start correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing in the **geoserver** stage because the `geoserver:2.17.2` image is Alpine‑based, so the `apt‑get` command used to install `wget` does not exist. Replace the Alpine‑specific package manager call with the correct one (or switch to a Debian‑based GeoServer image). For example, edit `dockers/CVE-2022-24816/custom_no_tool/geoserver/Dockerfile` so the install line reads:

```
FROM docker.io/geoserver:2.17.2
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache wget
```

or, if you prefer to keep using `apt‑get`, change the base image to a Debian‑based variant such as `geoserver:2.17.2-jdk11` (or any tag that is not Alpine) and keep the existing `apt‑get` line. After this change the Docker compose file will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the osgeo/geoserver:2.17.2 image runs as a non‑root user and therefore cannot run apt‑get commands; to fix it, prepend a USER root statement before the apt‑get update and wget install (and optionally switch back to the original user afterward), e.g. `USER root && apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && USER ${GEOSERVER_USER}`. After making that change the Geoserver layer will install wget successfully and the compose stack will build without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the geoserver image switches back to a user that isn’t defined – the `${GEOSERVER_USER:-geoserver}` expression expands to an empty string when the variable isn’t set, causing Docker to abort with “invalid user”. Change the Dockerfile so it always restores the original non‑root account explicitly (or omit the switch entirely if you don’t need it). For example, replace the last two lines with:

```
USER geoserver   # the default user in the official image
```

or simply delete the `USER` line after installing wget if you’re fine staying as root for the rest of the container lifecycle. After that the compose file will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the wait‑for‑it.sh script is written for bash but the python:3.9‑slim image does not include bash by default, so the container cannot execute the script during the CMD stage. Add bash to the list of packages installed in the app Dockerfile (or rewrite the script to be POSIX‑sh compatible) and then the image will build and start correctly. A one‑line change such as appending bash to the apt‑get install line resolves the issue without altering any other component.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
