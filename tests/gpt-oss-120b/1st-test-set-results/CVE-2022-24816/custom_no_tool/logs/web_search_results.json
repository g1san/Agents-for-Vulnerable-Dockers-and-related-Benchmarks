    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201124816 is a critical code\u2011injection vulnerability in the Jt\u2011Jiffle extension of the Java Advanced Imaging Extensions (JAI\u2011EXT) library that is bundled with GeoServer. The extension receives Jiffle scripts via the Web Processing Service (WPS) endpoint (`/geoserver/wms` or `/geoserver/wps`). The script text is inserted into a generated Java source file inside a Javadoc comment and then compiled at runtime with the Janino compiler. Because the comment is not properly escaped, an attacker can break out of the comment block, inject arbitrary Java code, and cause Janino to compile and load a malicious class. The malicious class can execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands in a static initializer (for example by redefining `java.lang.Double`). The exploit requires no authentication and works against any GeoServer deployment that includes the Jt\u2011Jiffle extension with a vulnerable version of the `jt\u2011jiffle` library (all versions prior to 1.1.22). Successful exploitation gives the attacker remote code execution with the privileges of the GeoServer process, allowing full control of the host system.",
