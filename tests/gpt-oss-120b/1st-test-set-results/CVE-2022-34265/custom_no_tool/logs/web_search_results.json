{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201134265 is a critical remote unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the Django web framework. The flaw resides in the ORM functions `Trunc()` and `Extract()` which interpolate the `kind` argument (for `Trunc`) and the `lookup_name` argument (for `Extract`) directly into the generated SQL statement without proper sanitisation. When an attacker can supply these arguments from request data, arbitrary SQL commands can be executed against the backend database. Successful exploitation allows reading, modifying, or deleting any data in the database and can also be used to cause denial of service (for example with `SELECT pg_sleep`). The vulnerability affects Django 3.2.x versions prior to 3.2.14 and Django 4.0.x versions prior to 4.0.6. It is fixed in Django 3.2.14, 4.0.6 and any later releases.",
