----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2017‑12635 is a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache CouchDB. The flaw resides in the handling of user documents stored in the special _users database. CouchDB parses JSON payloads twice: an Erlang‑based parser for internal storage and a JavaScript‑based parser for validation. When a JSON object contains duplicate keys, the Erlang parser retains the first occurrence while the JavaScript parser keeps the last one. An attacker can create a user document that includes two identical "roles" fields – one granting the special _admin role and another benign entry. The validation step sees only the benign entry and accepts the request, but the internal representation authorises the user with the _admin role taken from the first entry. Consequently a non‑admin user gains full administrative privileges and can perform any CouchDB operation, such as creating or deleting databases, reading all documents, and modifying server configuration. The vulnerability affects all CouchDB installations that allow ordinary users to write to the _users database. It is fixed in later releases that make the parsers consistent ("last‑key‑wins") and by tightening the validation of role assignments.

To generate a Docker environment vulnerable to CVE-2017-12635, please provide the list of services, versions, and any required configuration details that were described in the prior CVE-2017-12635 information message. The current request lacks that necessary data to create the appropriate docker-compose.yml and related Dockerfiles.





Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build failure, edit the README.txt (or accompanying script) so that it actually lists the required services—Apache CouchDB with the version range shown in the CVE description—and includes the necessary configuration (for example, mounting a custom validation function or user‑document JSON that contains duplicate “roles” keys). Then use that information to construct a valid docker‑compose.yml defining a CouchDB service based on the official image, setting the appropriate environment variables (e.g., COUCHDB_USER and COUCHDB_PASSWORD) and mounting any custom JSON or JavaScript files into /opt/couchdb/etc. Finally, ensure the Dockerfile (if one is used) copies these files into the image and runs couchdb with the modified configuration; after these adjustments the compose file will build without errors.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to set file‑only permissions on everything under **/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d** after copying the directory, but the `chmod -R 644` also touches the directory itself, which cannot have the “444” mode that `chmod` applies to the files. To fix it, change the permission step so it only applies to the regular files (or give the directory a permissive mode first) and make sure the target directory exists before the copy. For example, replace the two‑line `RUN` block with something like:

```
RUN mkdir -p /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d && \
    chown -R couchdb:couchdb /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d && \
    find /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +
```

This creates the target directory, sets the correct ownership, and then applies 644 only to the files, allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the CouchDB base image does not contain the tools (bash and curl) that the init script and the health‑check expect, and the Dockerfile tries to chmod a file that isn’t yet executable for the proper user; to fix it, add a layer that installs the missing utilities (e.g. `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl bash`) before the `COPY` step, then copy the `local.d` directory, set ownership to the existing `couchdb` user, and finally make `init.sh` executable with `chmod +x`; after these changes the image will build and the containers will start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to copy the *local.d* directory before it guarantees that the target path exists and then recreates the directory again, which can clash with the layer that already contains the copied files; to fix it, create the target folder first (RUN mkdir -p /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d) and then copy the contents (COPY local.d/ /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/), finally set the proper permissions in a single RUN step that makes the init script executable (chmod 755 /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/init.sh) and the other files readable (chmod -R 644 /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d && chmod +x /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/init.sh). This ensures the directory structure is present when the copy runs and the script can be executed without permission errors, allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base image couchdb:2.0 doesn’t contain the apt tools needed for the apt‑get commands and the init.sh script isn’t marked executable before it’s copied, so the layer that tries to change its permissions can’t find the file. Fix it by switching the base image to a Debian‑based variant that includes the package manager (for example couchdb:2.0‑ubuntu) or by installing apt‑transport‑https and ca‑certificates first, then add a RUN chmod +x /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/init.sh after the COPY step (or set the executable bit in the COPY command itself). Also ensure the health‑check URL is correct (e.g., http://localhost:5984/_up or /_up) so the container can start without failing the health probe. These small adjustments let the Dockerfile build cleanly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `evil_user.json` file is not valid JSON – it contains two identical “roles” keys, and Docker’s layer‑caching logic (and many JSON‑aware tools that run during the image build or container start‑up) rejects malformed JSON as a syntax error. To fix the problem, change the payload so the file remains syntactically correct while still exercising the duplicate‑key bug at runtime; the simplest way is to store the malicious payload as a raw string and feed it to `curl` with the `-d` flag instead of reading it from a JSON file, or encode the duplicate keys using a JSON‑compatible representation (e.g., keep the two “roles” entries inside a single array but let the validation function treat the first element as the effective role). After that, adjust the `init.sh` script to use the inline payload (or the corrected file) and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged. This removes the JSON parse error and allows the container to build and start successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base CouchDB image already provides curl (and a minimal Debian environment), so the `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl bash` step tries to run apt on a system that either lacks the package lists or is using a different package manager, causing the image build to abort. To fix it, drop the whole `apt‑get …` line and rely on the curl that ships with the CouchDB image; you only need to make sure the init script is executable, which the `chmod 755` line already does. With the package‑install step removed, the Dockerfile will copy the validation files and expose port 5984 without error, allowing the container to build and start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base image tag you reference (`couchdb:2.0.99`) does not exist on Docker Hub, so Docker can’t pull it and aborts the build; to fix it simply change the `FROM` line to a tag that is actually available (for example `FROM couchdb:2.0.99‑amd64` if you have a custom registry, or use the closest public version such as `couchdb:2.0.0` and then install the exact 2.0.99 release via apt‑get or by pulling the source tarball inside the Dockerfile). After you point the Dockerfile at a real image, the rest of the layers (creating `/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d`, copying the validation script and the init script, and setting permissions) will build correctly, and the container will start as intended.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile pulls the generic couchdb:2.0.0 image, which either isn’t available on Docker Hub or doesn’t contain the vulnerable code path expected by the rest of the setup; the compose file and the README both refer to version 2.0.99 as the vulnerable release. Change the FROM line in Dockerfile to `FROM couchdb:2.0.99` (or to the exact tag that exists in your registry), then rebuild – the rest of the files (the COPY of local.d/, the permissions on init.sh, and the health‑check) will work unchanged. This single change aligns the base image with the version the exploit expects and resolves the build‑time error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
