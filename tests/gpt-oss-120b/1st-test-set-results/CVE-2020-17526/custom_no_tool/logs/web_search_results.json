{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201117526 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache Airflow web server. The Airflow web UI (a Flask\u2011based application) uses a secret key to sign session cookies. In versions prior to 1.10.15 and prior to 2.0.2 the default value of the secret key is the static string \u201ctemporary_key\u201d. Because this key is known to anyone, an attacker can capture a valid session cookie, decode the JSON payload, change the `user_id` field to that of an administrative account, re\u2011sign the cookie with the same static key, and send it back to the vulnerable Airflow instance. The server accepts the forged cookie as an authenticated admin session, granting the attacker full control over the Airflow UI, DAG definitions, connection credentials and any downstream systems that can be accessed from Airflow tasks. The flaw is caused by a hard\u2011coded Flask secret key and improper validation of signed cookies.",
