CVE description: CVE‑2020‑17526 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache Airflow web server. The Airflow web UI (a Flask‑based application) uses a secret key to sign session cookies. In versions prior to 1.10.15 and prior to 2.0.2 the default value of the secret key is the static string “temporary_key”. Because this key is known to anyone, an attacker can capture a valid session cookie, decode the JSON payload, change the `user_id` field to that of an administrative account, re‑sign the cookie with the same static key, and send it back to the vulnerable Airflow instance. The server accepts the forged cookie as an authenticated admin session, granting the attacker full control over the Airflow UI, DAG definitions, connection credentials and any downstream systems that can be accessed from Airflow tasks. The flaw is caused by a hard‑coded Flask secret key and improper validation of signed cookies.
Attack Type: authentication bypass
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/airflow][['1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.10.3', '1.10.4', '1.10.5', '1.10.6', '1.10.7', '1.10.8', '1.10.9', '1.10.10', '1.10.11', '1.10.12', '1.10.13', '1.10.14', '2.0.0', '2.0.1']] Apache Airflow web server provides the vulnerable Flask UI; the hard‑coded secret key in these specific versions enables authentication bypass.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13.9']] Relational database used by Airflow to store metadata; required for the Docker compose stack to run Airflow.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container fails because the compose file’s command duplicates the ENTRYPOINT defined in the Dockerfile, causing Docker to try to run python exploit.py twice and exit with a “cannot execute” error. Remove the command line from the vulnerable service (or delete the ENTRYPOINT and keep the compose command) so the container is started with a single python exploit.py invocation. Also ensure the service runs as root (the default in the python:3.10‑slim image) so it can access the mounted Docker socket; no other changes are required.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is most likely that the exploit container can’t reach the Docker daemon because the socket isn’t being mounted correctly or the client is trying to use it before the daemon is ready. Fix it by making sure the socket is bound into the container as a writable volume (the line `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` is already correct) and by forcing the service to start after the Docker daemon on the host is up – adding a simple health‑check that pings the socket (or using `depends_on` with a condition) will give the container enough time to wait. In practice you can change the compose file to:

```yaml
vulnerable:
  build: .
  privileged: true
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "docker", "info"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
```

and adjust the Python script to retry the ping longer (increase `retries`/`delay`). This ensures the Docker socket is reachable when the exploit runs, allowing the container to start and execute successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that runs the exploit is failing the health‑check because the `docker info` command it uses isn’t available in the python:3.10‑slim image – the image only contains the Python interpreter and the Docker SDK for Python, not the Docker CLI binary that the health‑check expects. To fix the problem, modify the Dockerfile to install the Docker client (or replace the health‑check with something that doesn’t require the CLI). For example, add a line after setting the work‑dir that runs `apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, then rebuild the image; the health‑check will succeed and the service will stay up. If you prefer not to add the CLI, simply change the `healthcheck` section of `docker‑compose.yml` to a lightweight command such as `["CMD","python","-c","import time,sys;sys.exit(0)"]`. After rebuilding and redeploying, the vulnerable container will start correctly and the exploit script will be able to reach the Docker socket.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the exploit container never starts is that the Docker client inside exploit.py is pointing at the wrong socket path. In the Python SDK the URL must contain three slashes after “unix:”, i.e. `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`. Change the line that creates the client to `client = docker.DockerClient(base_url='unix:///var/run/docker.sock')`. After that rebuild the image and bring the stack up again; the container will be able to reach the host Docker daemon, pull the Alpine image and run the test command. If the service still fails, make sure the host’s Docker socket is correctly mounted (the compose file already does this) and that the container runs as root (the default user in the python:3.10‑slim image), so no additional permission changes are needed.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The vulnerable service is exiting immediately because the Dockerfile only installs the Docker SDK and runs exploit.py, so there is no long‑living process (the Airflow web UI) for the container to stay up and satisfy the healthcheck. To fix it, replace the minimal Python image with one that installs Apache Airflow (or base it on the official apache/airflow image), add the required Airflow Python dependencies, copy the Airflow configuration (or set the secret_key), and change the ENTRYPOINT (or CMD) to start the Airflow webserver (e.g., airflow webserver) instead of invoking exploit.py. Once the container runs the webserver, the healthcheck that pings Docker will succeed and the service will stay healthy. If you still need the exploit script for testing, run it from a separate helper container or invoke it manually after the webserver is up.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim‑Python image does not contain the full Docker engine package that docker.io tries to install (it pulls in systemd‑related services which cannot start in the build environment). Replace the apt line with a lightweight client install – for example, change the Dockerfile to install only the CLI (`apt-get install -y docker-cli`) and add any missing runtime libraries such as `ca‑certificates` and `curl`. After this modification the image can be built successfully and the exploit container will still be able to reach the host Docker socket via the mounted /var/run/docker.sock.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the *python:3.10‑slim* image does not contain a package called **docker-cli**; the Docker client binaries are provided by the **docker.io** (or **docker‑ce**) package, and the Python SDK can talk to the socket without any CLI tools at all. Edit the Dockerfile to drop the `docker-cli` install (or replace it with `docker.io` if you really need the CLI) and keep only the packages that actually exist in the slim base. A minimal, functional Dockerfile would look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Install only the packages that exist in the slim repo
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the exploit script and install the Docker Python SDK
COPY exploit.py .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir docker

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "exploit.py"]
```

With the erroneous `docker-cli` line removed (or replaced by `docker.io`), the image builds successfully and the exploit container can still communicate with the host Docker daemon via the mounted socket. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile’s `COPY exploit.py .` instruction can’t find the script in the build context – the compose file points to the `custom_no_tool` directory, but the file is actually residing one level deeper (or the path is otherwise mismatched). The quick fix is to make the copy path explicit and relative to the context, for example change the line to `COPY ./exploit.py /app/` (or move the `exploit.py` file into the same directory as the Dockerfile). After that, the image builds without error. If you still hit an apt‑install failure, replace the install line with a more robust form such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` so the packages are guaranteed to be available in the slim base. Once the copy path and apt line are corrected, the Docker compose stack will start normally.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to install packages without first ensuring the package manager’s cache is cleaned and without upgrading pip, which can cause dependency resolution errors inside the slim image; fixing it only requires a couple of small changes. Edit the Dockerfile so that the apt‑get line uses `--no-install-recommends`, removes the cache immediately after the install, and add a step that upgrades pip before installing the Docker SDK (for example, `RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir docker`). With those adjustments the layer that installs ca‑certificates and curl will complete successfully, pip will be up‑to‑date, and the Python SDK will install without errors, allowing the image to build and the compose stack to start.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
