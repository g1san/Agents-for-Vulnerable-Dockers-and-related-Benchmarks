    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20115531 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Elasticsearch core server (org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch) that affects all releases from version 1.0.0 through version 1.6.0 inclusive. The flaw resides in the snapshot\u2011restore API, which fails to properly validate file\u2011path inputs. By sending a crafted HTTP request to the Elasticsearch HTTP API (usually on port 9200) or the transport API (usually on port 9300) that contains \"../\" sequences (or URL\u2011encoded equivalents) in snapshot\u2011related parameters, an unauthenticated attacker can cause the server to read files outside the intended repository directory. The server will then return the contents of those files in the HTTP response, allowing the attacker to retrieve any file that the Elasticsearch process has read permissions for, such as configuration files, logs, SSH private keys, or the system password file. The vulnerability requires no authentication, no prior privileges, and can be exploited purely over the network. It results in a confidentiality breach, exposing sensitive data that may be leveraged for further compromise. The issue was fixed in Elasticsearch version 1.6.1, where proper path\u2011validation logic was added to the snapshot handling code. Mitigation strategies include upgrading to 1.6.1 or later, disabling the snapshot API, or restricting network access to the Elasticsearch ports with firewalls or reverse\u2011proxies.",
