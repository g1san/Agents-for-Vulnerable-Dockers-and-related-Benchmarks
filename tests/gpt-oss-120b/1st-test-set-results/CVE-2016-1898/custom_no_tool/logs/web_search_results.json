{
    "desc": "CVE-2016-1898 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework (specifically in the libavformat HLS demuxer). When FFmpeg processes an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist that contains a URL using the `subfile:` protocol, it incorrectly reads a line from a local file and incorporates that data into an outbound HTTP request. This enables an attacker who can supply a malicious M3U8 playlist to cause the FFmpeg process to perform a server\u2011side request to an attacker\u2011controlled address while embedding arbitrary data from the victim's filesystem in the request. The result is a server\u2011side request forgery that can be leveraged to read any file accessible to the FFmpeg process and exfiltrate its contents over the network.",
