    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201110054 is a vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine. The flaw resides in the `CREATE ALIAS` SQL statement, which allows a user to define a Java method as a database alias. When the H2 web console is reachable without authentication and is exposed to remote hosts (for example by enabling the `webAllowOthers` option), an attacker can send a malicious `CREATE ALIAS \u2026 AS $$ \u2026 $$` statement that injects and executes arbitrary Java code inside the H2 process. This results in full remote code execution on the host running the database, compromising the entire system. The vulnerability is present in all released versions of H2 that include the vulnerable code, including version 1.4.197 and later releases, because the issue is inherent to the `ALIAS` functionality rather than a bug in a specific release.",
