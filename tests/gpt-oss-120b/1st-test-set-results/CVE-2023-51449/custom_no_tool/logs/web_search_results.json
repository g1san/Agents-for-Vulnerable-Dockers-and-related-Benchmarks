    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201151449 is a high\u2011severity vulnerability in the Gradio Python library that allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The flaw resides in the `/file` HTTP endpoint, which is intended to serve only files located inside Gradio's temporary directory. The endpoint fails to correctly validate the supplied path, allowing path\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., `../` or URL\u2011encoded `%2e%2e%2f`) to escape the intended directory. An attacker can first upload a file to create a temporary sub\u2011directory via the `/upload` endpoint, then request `/file=<temp\u2011subdir>/../..../<target>` to retrieve any readable file such as `/etc/passwd`, Windows `win.ini`, or `/proc/self/environ`. The vulnerability can also be leveraged to extract environment variables that often contain API keys or tokens, leading to credential theft. No authentication, privileged user, or user interaction is required; the exploit works against any publicly reachable Gradio instance (including those hosted on Hugging Face Spaces) that runs a vulnerable version of the library. The issue was fixed in Gradio version 4.11.0; all earlier versions are vulnerable.",
