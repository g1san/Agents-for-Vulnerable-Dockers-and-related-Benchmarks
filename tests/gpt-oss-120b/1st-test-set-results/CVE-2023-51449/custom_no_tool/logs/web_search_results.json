    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201151449 is an unauthenticated local file inclusion vulnerability in the Gradio Python library. The flaw resides in the `/file` HTTP endpoint, which fails to correctly sanitize user\u2011supplied file paths. An attacker can supply directory\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to cause the server to read any file that the Gradio process can access, such as `/etc/passwd`, environment files, or secret configuration files. This enables arbitrary file read and potential credential leakage from publicly exposed Gradio demos (including Hugging\u202fFace Spaces). The vulnerability affects all Gradio releases prior to version 4.11.0, including the entire 4.0\u20114.10 series and earlier versions before 3.33.",
