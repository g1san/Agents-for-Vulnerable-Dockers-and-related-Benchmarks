    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20111000353 is a critical vulnerability in the Jenkins continuous\u2011integration server. The flaw resides in the legacy remoting\u2011based Jenkins command\u2011line interface (CLI). An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted, serialized java.security.SignedObject to the CLI endpoint. Jenkins deserializes the object with a raw ObjectInputStream, bypassing the block\u2011list protection and executing arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller. This gives the attacker full remote code execution on the host without needing any credentials. The vulnerability affects all Jenkins releases up to and including 2.56 for the weekly releases and up to and including 2.46.1 for the Long\u2011Term Support (LTS) releases. The issue was fixed in Jenkins 2.57 (weekly) and 2.46.2 (LTS) by disabling the legacy CLI by default, adding SignedObject to the block\u2011list, and back\u2011porting the newer HTTP\u2011based CLI.",
