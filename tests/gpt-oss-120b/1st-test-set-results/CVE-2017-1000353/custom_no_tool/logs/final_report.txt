----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2017‑1000353 is a critical vulnerability in the Jenkins continuous‑integration server. The flaw resides in the legacy remoting‑based Jenkins command‑line interface (CLI). An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted, serialized java.security.SignedObject to the CLI endpoint. Jenkins deserializes the object with a raw ObjectInputStream, bypassing the block‑list protection and executing arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller. This gives the attacker full remote code execution on the host without needing any credentials. The vulnerability affects all Jenkins releases up to and including 2.56 for the weekly releases and up to and including 2.46.1 for the Long‑Term Support (LTS) releases. The issue was fixed in Jenkins 2.57 (weekly) and 2.46.2 (LTS) by disabling the legacy CLI by default, adding SignedObject to the block‑list, and back‑porting the newer HTTP‑based CLI.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration does not include the jenkins/jenkins service; it builds a custom image from alpine:3.12. Neither the service definition nor the base image matches any of the listed vulnerable Jenkins versions, so both milestones are not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration does not include the jenkins/jenkins service; it builds a custom image from alpine:3.12. Neither the service definition nor the base image matches any of the listed vulnerable Jenkins versions, so both milestones are not satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the requirement you need to replace the placeholder “vulnerable” service with an actual Jenkins instance that runs a known‑affected version. Change the build directive to pull the official Jenkins image and tag it with one of the vulnerable releases (for example jenkins/jenkins:2.46.1), expose the CLI port (typically 8080) and mount the host filesystem if you still need that capability. Then adjust the command to start Jenkins normally (e.g., `["java","-jar","/usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war"]`) instead of the infinite sleep, ensuring the legacy CLI endpoint is reachable. This modification aligns the compose file with the listed vulnerable Jenkins versions and makes the test environment reflect the CVE scenario.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile ends with `CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]`, but Alpine’s sleep utility does not accept the literal “infinity” argument, causing the image creation to abort. Change that line to a command that reliably runs forever in Alpine, such as `CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]` (or `CMD ["sleep","9999999"]` if you prefer a long sleep). After updating the CMD, rebuild the image and the compose stack should start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file never references the Dockerfile under `vuln/`, yet the directory structure suggests you intended to build a custom image (for example, to add tools or patches). To fix it, either delete the unused Dockerfile – which eliminates any confusion – or modify the `vulnerable` service so it actually builds from the provided Dockerfile. In practice you would replace the `image: jenkins/jenkins:2.46.2` line with a `build:` block that points to the directory containing the Dockerfile (e.g. `build: ./vuln`) and then, if you still need the Jenkins base, change the Dockerfile to start `FROM jenkins/jenkins:2.46.2` instead of `FROM alpine:3.12`. This ensures Docker has a valid build context and a proper base image, removing the error while keeping the rest of the compose configuration unchanged.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile never switches back to the Jenkins user after installing curl, so the image is left in a state where the default Jenkins entrypoint runs as an undefined user and the container crashes on start‑up. Fix it by adding a line that restores the original Jenkins user after the package installation (for example, `USER jenkins`) and, optionally, expose the HTTP port explicitly. The revised Dockerfile would look like this: start from the vulnerable Jenkins base, switch to root, update the package index, install curl, clean the apt cache, then switch back to the `jenkins` user; you can also add `EXPOSE 8080` so the service is clearly declared. This small change restores the expected user context and allows the image to build and run without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Docker can’t find the Dockerfile at the path you gave it – the compose file’s `build.context: ./vuln` is interpreted relative to the location of docker‑compose.yml, not to the CVE‑2017‑1000353 folder, so Docker ends up looking in the wrong directory. Fix it by pointing the context to the actual directory that contains the Dockerfile (for example `build.context: ./dockers/CVE-2017-1000353/custom_no_tool/vuln` or by moving docker‑compose.yml into that folder and using `./vuln` as before). While you’re there, keep the `USER root` line for the apt install, then switch back to the jenkins user before exposing the port, and make sure the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable is defined in the container (you can keep it in compose or add an `ENV JAVA_OPTS=...` line in the Dockerfile). After correcting the context path the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build likely fails because the base Jenkins image already runs as the user “jenkins” and the Dockerfile switches back to that user before the EXPOSE instruction, which must be evaluated while the Dockerfile is still being parsed; some Docker versions treat EXPOSE as a runtime directive and therefore it should appear before the final USER change. To fix the issue, move the EXPOSE line above the USER jenkins statement (or simply remove the explicit USER change altogether, letting the base image keep its default user) and ensure the RUN step that installs curl runs as root without trying to access files that may be read‑only; a minimal change is to place EXPOSE 8080 right after the RUN line and before the USER jenkins line, then keep the rest of the file unchanged. This adjustment resolves the build error while preserving the intended privileged configuration.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the jenkins/jenkins:2.46.1 image no longer exists (or cannot be pulled for the host’s CPU architecture), so the Dockerfile never gets past the FROM line. Change the base image to a tag that is still available and matches the requested platform—for example, use jenkins/jenkins:lts‑jdk11 or pull the exact LTS version that still exists (e.g. jenkins/jenkins:2.46.2) and keep the platform: linux/amd64 setting. After updating the FROM instruction the rest of the Dockerfile (switching to root, installing curl, exposing 8080 and reverting to the jenkins user) will build correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Jenkins version in the image is 2.462.3 (shown by the JENKINS_VERSION label), which is not among the listed vulnerable versions, so the code_hard_version milestone fails. The image does use the jenkins/jenkins service, so services_ok passes.
	- ERROR: The Jenkins version in the image is 2.462.3 (shown by the JENKINS_VERSION label), which is not among the listed vulnerable versions, so the code_hard_version milestone fails. The image does use the jenkins/jenkins service, so services_ok passes.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you need to base the Docker image on a Jenkins release that is actually vulnerable, for example jenkins/jenkins:lts‑jdk11 tag 2.46.1 or any of the weekly versions up to 2.56. Change the FROM line in Dockerfile to reference that specific tag (e.g., FROM jenkins/jenkins:2.46.1‑jdk11) so the built image reports a JENKINS_VERSION that matches the vulnerable list. Once the version aligns, the existing service definition passes both services_ok and code_hard_version checks without further alterations.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is likely failing because the tag `jenkins/jenkins:2.46.1-jdk11` does not exist in the Docker Hub registry; switching the base image to a valid one such as `jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11` (or the exact LTS version that includes the JDK 11 build) resolves the lookup error. Additionally, when running `apt‑get` in the Dockerfile it’s safer to set `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and combine the update, install and clean‑up steps in a single `RUN` line (for example `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) so the layer finishes cleanly. After these two adjustments the image builds successfully and the compose file can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
