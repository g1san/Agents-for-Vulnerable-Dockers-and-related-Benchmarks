    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201145232 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard. The dashboard mixes two web frameworks\u2014Droplet, which provides authentication middleware, and Gin, which handles several routes directly. Because the Gin\u2011based routes are not wrapped by the Droplet authentication layer, an unauthenticated client can access privileged management endpoints. Through these endpoints an attacker can invoke the dashboard\u2019s built\u2011in Lua\u2011script execution feature or modify APISIX configuration objects, leading to unauthenticated remote code execution on the host that runs the dashboard. The flaw affects all dashboard releases from version 2.7.0 up to and including version 2.10.0. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 27\u202fDecember\u202f2021 and fixed in version 2.10.1, which adds proper authentication checks to all routes.",
