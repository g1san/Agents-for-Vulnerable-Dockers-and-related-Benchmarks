CVE description: CVE‑2021‑45232 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Apache APISIX Dashboard. The dashboard mixes two web frameworks—Droplet, which provides authentication middleware, and Gin, which handles several routes directly. Because the Gin‑based routes are not wrapped by the Droplet authentication layer, an unauthenticated client can access privileged management endpoints. Through these endpoints an attacker can invoke the dashboard’s built‑in Lua‑script execution feature or modify APISIX configuration objects, leading to unauthenticated remote code execution on the host that runs the dashboard. The flaw affects all dashboard releases from version 2.7.0 up to and including version 2.10.0. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 27 December 2021 and fixed in version 2.10.1, which adds proper authentication checks to all routes.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The app container fails because it tries to contact the Docker daemon before the dind service is ready and the `DOCKER_HOST` variable points to an unreachable socket; fixing it only requires two small changes: add a `depends_on: - dind` entry so Docker Compose starts the daemon first, and change the default `DOCKER_HOST` value in the Flask code to `tcp://dind:2375` (or set it explicitly in the compose file’s environment section) so the client connects to the correct TCP endpoint. After these adjustments the app will be able to pull and run images without crashing.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The app container is trying to talk to the dind service as soon as it starts, but the Docker daemon inside dind isn't ready yet, so the client can’t connect and the Flask process crashes. Fix it by adding a small start‑up wait that polls the dind API (for example, loop on curl http://dind:2375/_ping until you get a “OK” response) before creating the docker.DockerClient instance, or by using Compose’s depends_on with a health‑check on dind so the app only starts after the daemon reports healthy. Updating the Dockerfile to install a tiny wait‑script (or using an entrypoint that runs the script then launches app.py) resolves the race condition and gets the container running correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build is failing because the python:3.9‑slim base does not contain the compilation tools required by the docker Python package (and its transitive dependencies). Insert a short apt‑get stage before the pip install command so the required C compiler, headers and build utilities are present, then clean the cache to keep the image small; after that the rest of the Dockerfile works unchanged. This single change resolves the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the python:3.9‑slim base image does not contain the system packages needed to compile the native dependencies of the docker Python client, so the apt‑get install step never finishes successfully. Remove the explicit installation of the full build‑essential toolchain and replace it with just the minimal libraries required at runtime—typically libc6, libffi7 (and their‑dev headers only if you really need to compile), or better yet install the pre‑built docker‑py wheel which avoids compilation altogether. In practice you can change the Dockerfile to first install curl and ca‑certificates (for the health‑check), then run pip install --no‑cache‑dir -r requirements.txt without the extra gcc and make packages; if a native build is still required, add the missing python3‑dev and libffi-dev packages before the pip command and clean them up afterward to keep the image small. After these adjustments the image builds successfully and the wait script can connect to the DinD daemon as intended.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the requirements.txt pins an incompatible Werkzeug version for the Flask release you’re using, which makes pip install crash during the image build. The simplest fix is to remove the explicit Werkzeug line (Flask already pulls the correct version it needs) or change it to a version that matches Flask 2.0.3 (e.g. Werkzeug>=2.0,<2.1). After updating requirements.txt so the dependency set resolves cleanly, the RUN pip install step will succeed and the image will build without error. No other changes to the Dockerfile or compose file are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Python SDK’s dependencies need system‑level build tools that aren’t present in the slim image; add the required packages before running pip and make sure the wait‑script is copied from the build context. Change the Dockerfile so the apt‑get install line also pulls build‑essential and python3‑dev (and keeps the curl install), then run the pip install, and finally copy and chmod the wait_for_dind.sh script. With those extra packages the image compiles all wheels correctly and the container can start the script and Flask app without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the docker Python client pulls in the cryptography library, which on the python:3.9‑slim image now requires the Rust tool‑chain (and OpenSSL headers) to compile its wheels; the current Dockerfile only installs build‑essential and libffi‑dev, so pip cannot build the dependency and aborts. Fix the problem by extending the apt install line to also pull in rustc (and cargo if you like) and libssl-dev, or by switching the base image to a fuller variant such as python:3.9‑bullseye‑slim that already includes the needed tooling. After adding those packages (or changing the base), the pip install step succeeds and the image builds correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the python:3‑slim image does not contain the libraries and header files needed to compile the native wheels that the docker Python SDK pulls in (most notably cryptography, which now requires a Rust tool‑chain). The quickest way to get the image to build is to switch to a full‑featured Python base that already ships the compiler and SSL libraries, then drop the manual apt‑get install block that was added to try to satisfy those same requirements. In practice you would change the first line of Dockerfile to `FROM python:3.9` (and optionally keep the `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl ca‑certificates` if you still need curl for the wait script), remove the whole `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends …` stanza, and keep the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step as‑is. After that the image builds cleanly, the wait script is still copied and marked executable, and the Flask app can start normally.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile copies the whole source tree before the `requirements.txt`‑driven layer, which means the `pip install` step runs on a stale cache and often tries to install packages before the system tools it needs (curl/ca‑certificates) are actually present. The quickest fix is to reorder the Dockerfile so that the package manager install and the Python requirements installation happen first, then copy the rest of the application code (including the wait script). Also make sure the wait script is in the build context and marked executable before it’s used as an entrypoint. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to:

1. Install `curl` and `ca‑certificates` immediately after the `apt-get update`.
2. Copy only `requirements.txt` into the image, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then copy the remaining source files.
3. Copy the `wait_for_dind.sh` script, set its executable bit, and use it as the entrypoint (or wrap it in a shell‑form entrypoint) so that it can exec the Python command after the DIND daemon is reachable.

That reordering guarantees the needed OS packages exist when pip runs, ensures the wait script is present and executable, and eliminates the build‑time error.
