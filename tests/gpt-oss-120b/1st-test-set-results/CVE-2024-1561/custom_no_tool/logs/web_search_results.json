    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u20111561 is a remote file access vulnerability in the Gradio web UI framework. Versions of the Gradio Python package earlier than 4.13.0 expose a /component_server HTTP endpoint that allows an unauthenticated attacker to invoke internal component methods with attacker\u2011controlled arguments. By calling the move_resource_to_block_cache (in Gradio 4.x) or makeTempCopyIfNeeded / downloadTempCopyIfNeeded (in Gradio 3.x), the server copies an arbitrary file from the host filesystem into Gradio's temporary cache directory, which is then served publicly through the /file= endpoint. This enables an attacker to read any file that the Gradio process can access, such as /etc/passwd, environment files, configuration secrets, or other sensitive data. The vulnerability is especially exploitable when a Gradio app is launched with share=True or hosted on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, where the public URL is exposed. The issue is fixed in Gradio 4.13.0 and later.",
