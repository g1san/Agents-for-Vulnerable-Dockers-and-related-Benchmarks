CVE description: CVE‑2024‑1561 is a remote file access vulnerability in the Gradio web UI framework. Versions of the Gradio Python package earlier than 4.13.0 expose a /component_server HTTP endpoint that allows an unauthenticated attacker to invoke internal component methods with attacker‑controlled arguments. By calling the move_resource_to_block_cache (in Gradio 4.x) or makeTempCopyIfNeeded / downloadTempCopyIfNeeded (in Gradio 3.x), the server copies an arbitrary file from the host filesystem into Gradio's temporary cache directory, which is then served publicly through the /file= endpoint. This enables an attacker to read any file that the Gradio process can access, such as /etc/passwd, environment files, configuration secrets, or other sensitive data. The vulnerability is especially exploitable when a Gradio app is launched with share=True or hosted on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, where the public URL is exposed. The issue is fixed in Gradio 4.13.0 and later.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration builds a Python 3.11-slim image and installs only Flask (version 2.3.2). It does not reference the 'gradio-app/gradio' image in the Dockerfile nor install the gradio package in requirements.txt. Consequently, the required service is absent, so the Docker does not use any of the specified vulnerable gradio versions and also fails to include the required service.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration builds a Python 3.11-slim image and installs only Flask (version 2.3.2). It does not reference the 'gradio-app/gradio' image in the Dockerfile nor install the gradio package in requirements.txt. Consequently, the required service is absent, so the Docker does not use any of the specified vulnerable gradio versions and also fails to include the required service.
	- FIX: To make the Docker environment actually run the vulnerable Gradio service, replace the Flask‑only application with a small Gradio app and add the appropriate package version to the build: edit requirements.txt to include gradio==4.12.0 (or any of the listed vulnerable releases), update app.py to import gradio and launch a simple interface (for example, a textbox‑to‑textbox demo) instead of the Flask /download route, and remove the Flask import entirely. Then rebuild the image; the container will start the Gradio server on port 5000, exposing the /component_server endpoint that demonstrates CVE‑2024‑1561. This aligns the Docker composition with the intended vulnerable service.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Update the requirements.txt to use a patched Gradio release (for example gradio==4.13.0 or newer), rebuild the image and redeploy the compose stack. The newer version removes the unsafe /component_server endpoint, so the container will start normally and the vulnerability is eliminated. After changing the version run docker‑compose build followed by docker‑compose up to apply the fix.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is likely failing because the app hard‑codes the host and port instead of using the environment variables that Docker‑Compose already sets, which can cause a mismatch if the host port is changed or already in use. Edit app.py so that it reads GRADIO_SERVER_NAME and GRADIO_SERVER_PORT from the environment (falling back to the defaults) and then launches the interface with those values; for example, import os, set host = os.getenv("GRADIO_SERVER_NAME","0.0.0.0") and port = int(os.getenv("GRADIO_SERVER_PORT","5000")), and pass host and port to iface.launch(). This aligns the application with the compose configuration and lets the container start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build most likely fails because the slim base image does not contain the system libraries required to compile the wheels pulled in by huggingface_hub (and its dependencies). Adding a short apt‑get step before running pip install to install the build tools and any needed libraries (for example git, build‑essential, gcc, libffi-dev, and python3‑dev) resolves the error; after those packages are installed the pip install command can compile the dependencies and the image will build successfully. You can keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged, just insert an RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y … && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* line before the pip install line.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely fails because the slim base image doesn’t contain the graphical libraries that Gradio (and some of its optional dependencies) expect, causing an import‑time error when the Python process starts. Fix it by extending the Dockerfile to install the required system packages (e.g., `libglib2.0-0`, `libsm6`, `libxext6`, `libxrender1`, and `ffmpeg`), then rebuild the image; this supplies the missing shared libraries and lets `python app.py` launch the Gradio interface without crashing. After rebuilding, `docker‑compose up` should start the service correctly on port 5000.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image installs Gradio version 4.13.0 (as specified in requirements.txt). This version is not present in the allowed list of versions for the gradio-app/gradio service, which ends at 4.12.0. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met, while the required service 'gradio-app/gradio' is present, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- ERROR: The Docker image installs Gradio version 4.13.0 (as specified in requirements.txt). This version is not present in the allowed list of versions for the gradio-app/gradio service, which ends at 4.12.0. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met, while the required service 'gradio-app/gradio' is present, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: Change the requirements.txt to specify a Gradio version that is included in the allowed list—e.g., replace gradio==4.13.0 with gradio==4.12.0 or any earlier 4.12.x release. Then rebuild the image so the Dockerfile installs the downgraded package, which satisfies the code_hard_version milestone while keeping the rest of the configuration unchanged.
