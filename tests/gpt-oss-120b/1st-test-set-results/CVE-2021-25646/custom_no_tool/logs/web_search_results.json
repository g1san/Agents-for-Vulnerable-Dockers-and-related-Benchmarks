    "desc": "Apache Druid versions up to and including 0.20.0 contain a flaw in the indexing service (the /druid/indexer/v1/sampler endpoint) and in several query endpoints that allows an attacker to supply JavaScript code that is executed by the Druid JVM with full privileges. The malicious JavaScript can call Java APIs such as java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec() to run arbitrary operating\u2011system commands. The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication on default deployments because the sampler endpoint is often left open. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the host running the vulnerable Druid process.",
