CVE description: Apache Druid versions up to and including 0.20.0 contain a flaw in the indexing service (the /druid/indexer/v1/sampler endpoint) and in several query endpoints that allows an attacker to supply JavaScript code that is executed by the Druid JVM with full privileges. The malicious JavaScript can call Java APIs such as java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec() to run arbitrary operating‑system commands. The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication on default deployments because the sampler endpoint is often left open. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the host running the vulnerable Druid process.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/druid][['0.18.0', '0.18.1', '0.19.0', '0.19.1', '0.20.0']] Core Apache Druid service that contains the vulnerable sampler and query endpoints. Specific versions listed are those identified by MITRE and NIST as vulnerable to CVE‑2021‑25646.
- [SOFT-WEB][curlimages/curl][['7.88.1']] Simple HTTP client container used to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the Druid sampler endpoint for testing the vulnerability.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image is based on node:14-alpine and does not include any of the listed HARD services (apache/druid). Therefore it does not use a vulnerable version of apache/druid, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false. The compose file defines only one service (vulnerable-app) and does not reference apache/druid or curlimages/curl, so the required services list is not satisfied, making the 'services_ok' milestone false.
	- ERROR: The Docker image is based on node:14-alpine and does not include any of the listed HARD services (apache/druid). Therefore it does not use a vulnerable version of apache/druid, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false. The compose file defines only one service (vulnerable-app) and does not reference apache/druid or curlimages/curl, so the required services list is not satisfied, making the 'services_ok' milestone false.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestone you need to replace the custom Node.js service with a real Apache Druid instance that runs a vulnerable version (≤ 0.20.0) and add the curl client container so the required services are present; in the docker‑compose file you would define a [HARD] apache/druid service using an image tag such as apache/druid:0.20.0, expose the Druid coordinator and broker ports, and then add a [SOFT‑WEB] curlimages/curl service that depends on the Druid service and can be used to issue the malicious POST to /druid/indexer/v1/sampler. Removing the unrelated “vulnerable‑app” container or moving it to a separate compose file eliminates the mismatch, and the resulting configuration will contain both the hard and soft services required for the ‘services_ok’ and ‘code_hard_version’ milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is likely that the curl service starts and immediately goes idle while the druid service may not have finished its initialization, causing the compose to think the container failed or exit. Change the curl service’s entrypoint to run a short loop that retries a request to the Druid sampler endpoint until it succeeds, for example replacing the static sleep command with a while loop that uses curl to poll http://druid:8081/druid/indexer/v1/sampler and only exits when it receives a 200 response; this ensures the container stays alive and only proceeds once Druid is ready. Additionally, adding a restart: unless‑stopped policy to both services will make Docker automatically restart any container that exits unexpectedly, helping keep the stack running.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The likely cause of the failure is the way the curl service’s entrypoint is written – the $(…) sub‑shell is interpreted by Docker Compose before it is passed to sh, so the command never runs and the container exits with a syntax error. Change the entrypoint to a single‑quoted string so the $(…) is evaluated inside the container, for example: entrypoint: ["sh","-c","'until [ $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" http://druid:8081/druid/indexer/v1/sampler) -eq 200 ]; do echo \"Waiting for Druid sampler endpoint…\"; sleep 5; done; echo \"Druid sampler is ready\"; tail -f /dev/null'"] or, simpler, replace the array with a script file mounted into the container and invoke sh /script.sh. Adding a healthcheck to the druid service and making curl depend on that healthcheck instead of a raw loop also prevents race conditions and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because the health‑check runs `curl` inside the official apache/druid image, but that image does not include the curl binary, so the container never reports “healthy” and the dependent curl service never starts. To fix it, either replace the health‑check with a command that exists in the druid image (for example `wget -qO- http://localhost:8081/druid/indexer/v1/sampler`) or build a small custom druid image that installs curl (add a Dockerfile that `FROM apache/druid:0.20.0` and runs `apk add --no-cache curl` or the appropriate package manager command) and point the service to that new image. After the health‑check can succeed, the compose stack will start normally.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the health‑check command assumes the Druid image includes wget, which it does not, so the test never succeeds and Docker reports an error; replace the healthcheck with a curl‑based command (for example: test: ["CMD‑SHELL","curl -f -s http://localhost:8081/druid/indexer/v1/sampler || exit 1"]) and keep the rest of the compose unchanged. This change lets Docker correctly probe the sampler endpoint, the service reaches a healthy state, and the curl container can start without the compose file aborting.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file only pulls images, so the failure is coming from the health‑check that runs inside the Druid container; the official apache/druid image does not include the curl binary, so the CMD‑SHELL command cannot be executed and Docker marks the service as unhealthy, causing the dependent curl service to never start. To fix it, replace the health‑check with a command that is guaranteed to exist in the base image—e.g. use nc or wget instead of curl (for example: test: ["CMD-SHELL","nc -z localhost 8081 || exit 1"] or test: ["CMD-SHELL","wget -qO- http://localhost:8081/druid/indexer/v1/sampler >/dev/null || exit 1"]). After that change the compose will spin up both containers without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Druid base image runs as a non‑root user, so the `apt‑get` step cannot install packages. Add a temporary switch to the root user before the package install and then switch back to the original Druid user (or just leave it as root if you don’t need the original user). For example, modify the Dockerfile to insert `USER root` before the `RUN apt‑get …` line and, after the install, optionally restore the original user with `USER druid`. This gives the build permission to run `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl`, eliminating the error and allowing the healthcheck to use curl successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the apache/druid:0.20.0 image you are extending does not contain the apt‑get package manager (it’s based on an Alpine‑derived image), so the `RUN apt‑get …` line aborts. The simplest fix is to stop trying to install `curl` from apt‑get – the Druid image already includes the `curl` binary (or you can pull it from the host network). Remove the `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl …` line entirely (or replace it with an Alpine‑compatible command such as `apk add --no-cache curl` if you really need to add it). After deleting or adjusting that line, keep the `USER druid` stanza so the container runs as the non‑root user, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `apache/druid:0.20.0` image is not based on Alpine Linux, so the `apk` package manager does not exist and the `RUN apk add --no-cache curl` step aborts. To fix it, replace the `apk` command with the package manager that matches the base distribution (normally Debian/Ubuntu for the official Druid image). Changing the Dockerfile line to `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` will install curl correctly. After that, you can keep the `USER druid` line so the container runs with the intended non‑root user. With this single change the image should build without errors.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
