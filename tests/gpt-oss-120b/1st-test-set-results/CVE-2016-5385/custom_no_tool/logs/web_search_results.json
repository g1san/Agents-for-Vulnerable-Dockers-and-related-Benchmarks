    "desc": "CVE-2016-5385 is a vulnerability in the PHP interpreter when it is run in a CGI or FastCGI environment. The CGI specification (RFC 3875) copies an incoming `Proxy:` HTTP header into an environment variable named `HTTP_PROXY`. PHP reads the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to configure outbound proxy settings. An attacker can therefore send a request containing a malicious `Proxy:` header, causing the PHP process to route any subsequent outgoing HTTP requests through an attacker\u2011controlled proxy. This enables request header injection that can lead to credential theft, data exfiltration, man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle attacks, or further server\u2011side exploitation. The flaw is present in vulnerable PHP 5.x releases and in early PHP 7.0 releases. It does not require authentication and can be triggered remotely by a single crafted HTTP request.",
