CVE description: CVE-2016-5385 is a vulnerability in the PHP interpreter when it is run in a CGI or FastCGI environment. The CGI specification (RFC 3875) copies an incoming `Proxy:` HTTP header into an environment variable named `HTTP_PROXY`. PHP reads the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to configure outbound proxy settings. An attacker can therefore send a request containing a malicious `Proxy:` header, causing the PHP process to route any subsequent outgoing HTTP requests through an attacker‑controlled proxy. This enables request header injection that can lead to credential theft, data exfiltration, man‑in‑the‑middle attacks, or further server‑side exploitation. The flaw is present in vulnerable PHP 5.x releases and in early PHP 7.0 releases. It does not require authentication and can be triggered remotely by a single crafted HTTP request.
Attack Type: request header injection leading to proxy hijacking

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the web container never starts is that the Node image is built without installing the required npm packages, so the `require('express')` and `require('mysql')` calls fail at runtime; add a `package.json` that lists “express” and “mysql” as dependencies, copy it into the image and run `npm ci` (or `npm install`) before copying `app.js`. Also make the web service wait for the MySQL container to become healthy – either by adding a simple start‑up loop in the entrypoint that polls `db:3306` or by using a lightweight wait‑for‑it script – so the MySQL server is ready when the Node app tries to connect. With those two changes the compose stack should bring up all three containers correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the health‑check commands rely on the `curl` binary, which isn’t included in the vanilla httpd and php:5.6‑fpm images; when the containers start Docker can’t execute the health‑check script and aborts the build. Fix it by installing curl in each Dockerfile (e.g. add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` right after the `FROM` line in both the httpd and php images), and optionally verify that the php‑fpm status endpoint is enabled or change the health‑check to a command that’s guaranteed to exist (such as `php-fpm -t`). After adding the package installation the images will build and the health‑checks will run successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `RUN echo … >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf` line in the Apache Dockerfile uses a back‑slashed newline inside a quoted string, which breaks the shell parser; rewriting the command to use separate `RUN` statements (or a single `printf` with proper escaping) fixes the syntax error, and escaping the `$1` in the `ProxyPassMatch` directive prevents it from being interpreted as a shell variable. In addition, the PHP image should reference a tag that actually exists (for example `php:5.6.40-fpm` or `php:5.6-fpm-alpine`) instead of the generic `php:5.6-fpm`, which can cause a “manifest not found” failure on newer Docker registries. Updating those two lines eliminates the build error and lets the composition start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails during the `apt‑get update` step of the PHP build – the old Stretch repositories are now served only over HTTPS and the base php:5.6‑fpm image doesn’t have the transport or certificate packages installed, so the update can’t reach the archive and the build aborts. The fix is to install the HTTPS transport (and certificates) before you run the update and then proceed with the rest of the steps. In practice you just add a line such as  

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apt-transport-https ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```  

before the `sed` that rewrites /etc/apt/sources.list, or combine it with the existing `apt‑get update` that follows the `sed`. After the transport is present the `apt‑get update` succeeds, the curl and mysqli extensions install normally and the Docker build completes. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP 5.6‑fpm image you start from does not contain the compilation tools needed for `docker-php-ext-install mysqli`, and the Apache image is pulling the “slim” variant that lacks `apt‑get`, so the `apt‑get update && install curl` step can’t run. The quick fix is to switch both base images to the full Debian‑based tags (e.g. `php:5.6-fpm-stretch` and `httpd:2.4.54-bullseye`) and, before you run `docker-php-ext-install`, install the required build dependencies (`apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y build-essential libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev default-mysql-client`) then clean up the apt cache; similarly, in the Apache Dockerfile add a `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y curl` after switching to a tag that includes `apt`. With those two changes the images will compile and the compose stack will start normally.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP image’s Dockerfile rewrites the Debian sources list to the very old archive URLs and then tries to install packages that are no longer available (or are blocked by the expired repository metadata), which causes `apt-get update` to error out. The quickest fix is to stop overwriting the source list and just use the default repositories that come with the php:5.6‑fpm base, then install the required packages in a single RUN step so the package cache is still valid when the install runs. In practice you would delete the three lines that echo the `deb http://archive.debian.org…` entries and the `Acquire::Check‑Valid‑Until` file, keep one `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y … && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` command that pulls curl, build‑essential, the image libraries and php extensions, and the rest of the Dockerfile can remain unchanged. This restores a working package install and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the httpd Dockerfile tries to pull the wait‑for‑it.sh script with an ADD instruction that references a remote URL – recent Docker versions disable remote ADD by default, causing the layer to error out. Change the Dockerfile so the script is downloaded inside a RUN command (for example, RUN curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnubob/wait‑for‑it/master/wait‑for‑it.sh -o /usr/local/bin/wait‑for‑it.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wait‑for‑it.sh) and delete the ADD line. This ensures the script is fetched at build time and the image can be built successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP 5.6‑fpm image you reference is no longer present in the public registry, so Docker cannot pull it and the subsequent apt‑get steps never run. Replace the base image with a tag that still exists (for example `php:5.6-fpm-buster` or `php:5.6-fpm-alpine`), adjust the package‑install lines if you switch to Alpine (use `apk add` instead of `apt‑get`), and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged; once the image can be pulled the health‑check script will be placed in `/usr/local/bin` and the container will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing in the PHP image because the `mysqli` extension cannot be compiled without the MySQL client development headers, so you need to add the package that provides `mysql_config` (for example `default-libmysqlclient-dev` on Buster) to the list of packages installed before running `docker-php-ext-install mysqli`. Edit the `php/Dockerfile` to include `default-libmysqlclient-dev` (and optionally `pkg-config`) in the `apt‑get install` line, then the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` step will succeed and the image will build correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
