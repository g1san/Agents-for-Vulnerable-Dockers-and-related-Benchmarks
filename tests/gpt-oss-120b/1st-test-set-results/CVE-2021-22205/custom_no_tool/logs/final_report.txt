CVE description: CVE-2021-22205 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability present in GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. The flaw resides in the image‑processing pipeline that invokes the third‑party ExifTool without properly sanitising user‑supplied image files. An unauthenticated attacker can upload a specially crafted image (for example a DjVu file) through any public endpoint that processes images (such as avatar or project image upload). The malicious Exif metadata is passed directly to ExifTool, which executes the attacker‑controlled command on the GitLab server as the `git` user. This gives the attacker full remote command execution capability, allowing actions such as outbound DNS/HTTP callbacks, reverse shells, SSH key injection, or modification of user passwords. All GitLab releases from version 11.9 up to, but not including, the patched releases 13.8.8, 13.9.6, and 13.10.3 are vulnerable.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][gitlab/gitlab-ce][['11.9.x‑13.8.7', '13.9.0‑13.9.5', '13.10.0‑13.10.2']] Core GitLab Community Edition service that includes the vulnerable image‑upload handling and invokes ExifTool. This service must be present for the vulnerability to exist.

Please provide the list of services and their specific versions that are associated with CVE-2021-22205 as described in the prior message. This information is required to generate the docker-compose.yml and related configuration files to recreate the vulnerable environment.





Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The vulnerable stack consists of GitLab Community Edition versions 11.9.x through 13.8.7, 13.9.0 through 13.9.5, and 13.10.0 through 13.10.2 (service identifier [HARD][gitlab/gitlab-ce]), a PostgreSQL database using the 13‑alpine tag (service identifier [SOFT-DB][postgres]), and a Redis cache using the 6‑alpine tag (service identifier [SOFT-CACHE][redis]). To resolve the Docker build failure, verify that the docker‑compose file references these exact image tags, correct any mismatched or missing version strings, and ensure the custom Dockerfile for the GitLab service pulls the proper CE image version; also confirm that the dependent postgres and redis services are defined with the specified Alpine tags so that Docker can resolve and pull the images successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the GitLab service is trying to start before its PostgreSQL and Redis dependencies are ready and because the image tag is slightly off – the official tag for that release is `gitlab/gitlab-ce:13.10.2-ce.0` instead of just `13.10.2-ce`. Fix the compose file by changing the GitLab image line to use the exact tag and by updating the `depends_on` section to wait for the health checks of postgres and redis (e.g., `depends_on: {postgres: {condition: service_healthy}, redis: {condition: service_healthy}}`). After those two edits the containers will start in the correct order and the image will pull successfully, eliminating the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but its health status is still "starting" and the logs contain several error messages: missing VERSION file, ulimit failure (cannot modify limit), read‑only file‑system warning, and deprecation warnings. These indicate that the service has not completed its initialization and is not yet healthy, so the container is not running correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running, but its health status is still "starting" and the logs contain several error messages: missing VERSION file, ulimit failure (cannot modify limit), read‑only file‑system warning, and deprecation warnings. These indicate that the service has not completed its initialization and is not yet healthy, so the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the GitLab container past the “starting” state you should give it write access to the directories it needs and relax the default limits that the image tries to raise. First, change the volume definitions so that the three GitLab mount points are bound to host directories that are not read‑only (for example `./gitlab-config:/etc/gitlab`, `./gitlab-logs:/var/log/gitlab`, `./gitlab-data:/var/opt/gitlab`) or add `:rw` to the named volumes; this removes the read‑only filesystem warning. Next, add a `ulimits` section under the gitlab service to allow the process to raise its number of open files and processes (for example `ulimits: nofile: { soft: 65536, hard: 65536 }` and `nproc: { soft: 65536, hard: 65536 }`). Finally, set a root password in the Omnibus config (e.g. `gitlab_rails['initial_root_password'] = 'ChangeMe!'`) so that GitLab’s internal health checks can complete successfully; without a password the health check stalls. After applying these three changes, rebuild and restart the stack (`docker compose up --build -d`) and the GitLab service should transition to a healthy state.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running, but its health status is still "starting" and the logs contain several non‑fatal errors and warnings: missing VERSION file, ulimit adjustments failing (cannot modify limit), read‑only file‑system warnings, and obsolete URI warnings. These indicate the service has not fully initialized and the healthcheck has not yet succeeded, so the container is not running correctly yet.
	- ERROR: The container is reported as running, but its health status is still "starting" and the logs contain several non‑fatal errors and warnings: missing VERSION file, ulimit adjustments failing (cannot modify limit), read‑only file‑system warnings, and obsolete URI warnings. These indicate the service has not fully initialized and the healthcheck has not yet succeeded, so the container is not running correctly yet.
	- FIX: To get the GitLab container past the “starting” state you need to make the bind‑mounts writable for the internal processes and raise the ulimit values before GitLab starts; change the volume definitions to use `:rw` (they already do, but ensure the host directories exist and are owned by UID 998 so GitLab can write the VERSION file), add a `sysctls` entry such as `fs.file‑max=200000` and increase the `ulimits` for `nofile` and `nproc` to values the host kernel will accept (for example 1048576), and give the healthcheck a longer startup window by adding `start_period: 2m` and increasing the `retries` count. After these adjustments the container can create the missing files, apply the limits, and the healthcheck will eventually succeed, allowing GitLab to report a healthy state.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the wrapper script is being run as the default non‑root GitLab user, so the `chown` command in `init.sh` can’t modify the mounted directories and the container aborts before the real entrypoint is reached. Fix it by running the permission‑adjustment steps as root and then handing control back to the original GitLab entrypoint. In practice you add a `USER root` line before the `chown` in `init.sh` (or in the Dockerfile), make sure the script itself is owned and executable by root, and after the `chown` simply `exec /assets/wrapper "$@"` so the standard GitLab start‑up proceeds unchanged. This small change restores the ability to build the image and start the container without error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the wrapper script that the original GitLab image expects is not located at **/assets/wrapper**; the correct binary is **/assets/entrypoint**. Change the last line of *init.sh* to `exec /assets/entrypoint "$@"` and keep the Dockerfile’s `ENTRYPOINT ["/init.sh"]` unchanged. After that the image will build successfully, the permissions fix will run, and the real GitLab entrypoint will be invoked correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the container starts the wrapper script as the gitlab user, so the `chown` in init.sh doesn’t have the privileges it needs; the script then silently falls back, leaving the mounted directories with the wrong ownership and causing the GitLab entrypoint to abort. Fix it by keeping the wrapper running as root and only dropping to the gitlab UID right before the real entrypoint is invoked – for example, in the Dockerfile leave `USER root` (or switch back to root just before `ENTRYPOINT`) and change `init.sh` to `exec gosu gitlab /assets/entrypoint "$@"` (or `exec su-exec gitlab /assets/entrypoint "$@"`). This gives the script the rights to fix permissions and then hands control over to the original GitLab process without altering any other logic.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the wrapper script that GitLab ships expects to run as root and performs its own privilege‑dropping; by forcing a gosu‑drop before the wrapper runs the image can’t finish its own initialization, so the service never starts. To fix it, replace the custom init.sh with a very thin script (or remove it entirely) that simply execs the original /assets/entrypoint without using gosu, and change the Dockerfile to keep the upstream ENTRYPOINT (or point it at the new thin script). This lets the built‑in wrapper handle permissions correctly and the GitLab service will come up.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running but its health check is still in the "starting" state and repeatedly fails – the health‑check command tries to curl http://localhost:80/-/health and gets "connection refused". This indicates the GitLab web service has not come up yet. Additionally the logs contain warnings about unable to set ulimit limits, but those are non‑fatal. The failed health check means the container is not yet operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is running but its health check is still in the "starting" state and repeatedly fails – the health‑check command tries to curl http://localhost:80/-/health and gets "connection refused". This indicates the GitLab web service has not come up yet. Additionally the logs contain warnings about unable to set ulimit limits, but those are non‑fatal. The failed health check means the container is not yet operating correctly.
	- FIX: To get the health‑check to succeed you should stop disabling the bundled PostgreSQL and Redis services in the omnibus configuration, because GitLab cannot start its web server without a functional database and cache. Remove or set `postgresql['enable'] = true` and `redis['enable'] = true` in the `GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG` block (or simply delete those lines), let the container use the external postgres and redis services defined in the compose file, and then increase the health‑check `start_period` to give GitLab enough time to initialize (for example `start_period: 5m`). After those changes GitLab will launch its web process, the curl to http://localhost:80/-/health will succeed, and the container will report healthy.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker reports the container as running, but the built‑in healthcheck repeatedly fails (curl to http://localhost:80 returns 'Connection refused') and the logs contain warnings about ulimit limits that cannot be set. These symptoms indicate that the GitLab service inside the container is not operational, so the container is not running correctly.
