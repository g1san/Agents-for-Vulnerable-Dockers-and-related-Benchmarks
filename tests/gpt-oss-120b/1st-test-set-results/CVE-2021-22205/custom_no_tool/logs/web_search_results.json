    "desc": "CVE-2021-22205 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability present in GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. The flaw resides in the image\u2011processing pipeline that invokes the third\u2011party ExifTool without properly sanitising user\u2011supplied image files. An unauthenticated attacker can upload a specially crafted image (for example a DjVu file) through any public endpoint that processes images (such as avatar or project image upload). The malicious Exif metadata is passed directly to ExifTool, which executes the attacker\u2011controlled command on the GitLab server as the `git` user. This gives the attacker full remote command execution capability, allowing actions such as outbound DNS/HTTP callbacks, reverse shells, SSH key injection, or modification of user passwords. All GitLab releases from version 11.9 up to, but not including, the patched releases 13.8.8, 13.9.6, and 13.10.3 are vulnerable.",
