Services required to reproduce CVE-2021-22205:

1. GitLab Community Edition (hard dependency)
   - Image: gitlab/gitlab-ce:13.10.2-ce.0
   - Versions covered by the vulnerability: 11.9.x‑13.8.7, 13.9.0‑13.9.5, 13.10.0‑13.10.2
   - Exposes HTTP on port 8080 and SSH on port 2222.
   - Uses bind mounts (./gitlab-config, ./gitlab-logs, ./gitlab-data) with read‑write access.
   - ulimits are set to allow sufficient file descriptors and processes.
   - An initial root password is set via Omnibus config to allow health checks to complete.

2. PostgreSQL (soft dependency - database)
   - Image: postgres:13-alpine
   - Used by GitLab for persistent storage of application data.

3. Redis (soft dependency - cache)
   - Image: redis:6-alpine
   - Used by GitLab for caching and background job coordination.

All three services are defined in docker-compose.yml and will start automatically with the command:

    docker compose up --build -d

No manual setup is required. The containers will be networked together by Docker Compose default network, and GitLab will be reachable at http://localhost:8080.
