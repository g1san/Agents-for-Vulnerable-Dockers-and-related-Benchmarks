    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201129300 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the WDDX deserialization code used by ColdFusion when handling requests to unauthenticated CFC endpoints such as /CFIDE/adminapi/accessmanager.cfc. An attacker can supply a crafted WDDX payload that causes ColdFusion to deserialize a Java class (for example com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl) via unsafe reflection. The deserialized object performs a JNDI lookup to a malicious LDAP server, which loads attacker\u2011controlled code and results in arbitrary code execution on the ColdFusion server. The vulnerability affects all supported ColdFusion releases (2018, 2021, 2023) prior to the July\u20112023 patches and can be triggered without authentication by sending a high\u2011volume of specially crafted requests.",
