CVE description: CVE‑2023‑29300 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw resides in the WDDX deserialization code used by ColdFusion when handling requests to unauthenticated CFC endpoints such as /CFIDE/adminapi/accessmanager.cfc. An attacker can supply a crafted WDDX payload that causes ColdFusion to deserialize a Java class (for example com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl) via unsafe reflection. The deserialized object performs a JNDI lookup to a malicious LDAP server, which loads attacker‑controlled code and results in arbitrary code execution on the ColdFusion server. The vulnerability affects all supported ColdFusion releases (2018, 2021, 2023) prior to the July‑2023 patches and can be triggered without authentication by sending a high‑volume of specially crafted requests.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only two services: 'app' based on node:14-alpine and 'db' based on postgres:12. Neither service uses the 'adobe/coldfusion' image, and no version of adobe/coldfusion is present in the inspected images. Consequently, the required service 'adobe/coldfusion' is not used, and there is no vulnerable 'adobe/coldfusion' version in the deployment.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only two services: 'app' based on node:14-alpine and 'db' based on postgres:12. Neither service uses the 'adobe/coldfusion' image, and no version of adobe/coldfusion is present in the inspected images. Consequently, the required service 'adobe/coldfusion' is not used, and there is no vulnerable 'adobe/coldfusion' version in the deployment.
	- FIX: To align the composition with the CVE‑2023‑29300 scenario, add a ColdFusion container that runs a supported Adobe ColdFusion image (for example adobe/coldfusion:2021‑u5) and expose the port that ColdFusion listens on (typically 8500). In the docker‑compose.yml file, replace the current Node “app” service with a coldfusion service that mounts your webroot (or a minimal test CFC) and set the required environment variables (e.g., CFINSTALLDIR, CF_PASSWORD). Then remove the vulnerable Node app and its shell‑execution endpoint, keeping only the PostgreSQL service if the ColdFusion application needs a database, and adjust the depends_on relationship so the ColdFusion container starts after the database. This provides the necessary adobe/coldfusion service and eliminates the unrelated Node‑based vulnerability.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ColdFusion component you’re mounting contains a syntax error – the `cfreturn` line ends with an extra semicolon, which makes the CFC invalid and causes the container to abort when it tries to start the server. Remove that trailing “;” so the function ends with `<cfreturn "Hello from ColdFusion!">` and the image will start correctly. If the compose still can’t pull `adobe/coldfusion:2021u5` (the tag was removed from Docker Hub), switch to a supported tag such as `adobe/coldfusion:2021` or pull a local copy that you’ve built. Once the component is fixed and a valid ColdFusion image is referenced, the compose file works without any further changes.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file references host paths that don’t exist where Docker expects them and the ColdFusion image also requires explicit acceptance of the Adobe licence; you can fix it by creating an empty “webroot” directory alongside the compose file (or adjusting the bind‑mount to the correct absolute path) and by adding the variable CF_ACCEPT_EULA=YES to the ColdFusion service’s environment section, then rerun docker‑compose. Additionally, verify that the init.sql file is located exactly at ./db/init.sql relative to the compose file (or update the bind‑mount to the correct location) so the Postgres container can copy it during startup. Once those paths and the licence flag are corrected, the services should build and start normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because it is missing a top‑level `version:` declaration and the `environment` section for the PostgreSQL service is using a mixed mapping style that some Docker Compose parsers reject. Adding a version line (for example `version: "3.8"`), moving the `environment` block for the `db` service into a simple list of `KEY=VALUE` strings (or keeping it as a proper map under quotes) will make the file valid YAML and allow Docker Compose to bring the stack up without errors. After inserting the version line and normalising the environment syntax, the services will start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file is trying to mount directories that don’t exist relative to its location – the “./webroot” and “./db/init.sql” paths resolve to nothing when Docker Compose runs, causing a volume‑mount error. Fix it by moving the compose file into the same directory that contains the “webroot” folder and the “db” sub‑folder (or change the host‑side paths to the correct absolute or relative locations that actually exist), then ensure the “webroot” directory contains at least one file (the Test.cfc you already have) so the mount is valid. Optionally, rename the “db_data” volume declaration to match the top‑level “volumes:” block (which you already have) and verify the ColdFusion image tag (adobe/coldfusion:2021) is still available; after correcting the mount paths the services will start without the previous error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the ColdFusion container expects the CF_INSTALL_DIR directory to already exist inside the image, and mounting ./webroot directly onto /opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot overwrites the default wwwroot structure, causing the startup script to crash; you can fix this by removing the volume mount or by mapping the contents into a sub‑directory (for example ./webroot:/opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot/custom) and updating the CF_INSTALL_DIR if needed. In the db service the init script is being mounted as a file but the container expects a directory, so change the mount to ./db:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d or place the init.sql file inside a folder that is mounted as a directory. Finally, ensure you run docker‑compose from the directory that contains the docker‑compose.yml or supply the ‑f option with the correct relative path so the file references resolve correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the host‑side folders you bind‑mount don’t exist (or aren’t writable) when Docker tries to start the containers, so the mount operation aborts the startup. Create the missing directories before you run docker‑compose (for example mkdir -p ./webroot and mkdir -p ./db) and make sure the user running Docker has read/write permission on them; you can also tighten the ColdFusion mount to the exact wwwroot path (e.g. ‑ ./webroot:/opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot) if you don’t need the extra “custom” subdirectory. Once the host directories are present and accessible, the services will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose fails because the ColdFusion image tag you reference ( adobe/coldfusion:2023.0.0.330468 ) isn’t published on Docker Hub, so Docker can’t pull it and aborts the build. To fix the issue, replace the tag with a publicly available one (for example adobe/coldfusion:2023 or the latest adobe/coldfusion image) and keep the same environment variables so the container still accepts the EULA and sets the admin password. At the same time make sure the host directories you mount actually exist – create an empty webroot folder (or rename the mount to the existing path) before starting compose; otherwise Docker will throw a “mount source not found” error. Once the image tag is correct and the bind‑mount paths exist, docker‑compose up will pull the ColdFusion image, start the database, and the services will come online without further build‑time failures.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file mounts directories that don’t exist at the expected locations, so Docker cannot create the bind‑mounts; to fix it you just need to create the missing folders (or adjust the paths) so that ./webroot and ./db are real directories next to the compose file and contain the CFC file and the init.sql respectively, then rerun docker compose up — the official adobe/coldfusion:2023 image already starts the server, so no Dockerfile is required. If you prefer to keep the current layout, change the volume definitions to point at the exact files (e.g., ./db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql) or move the files into a proper folder hierarchy that matches the bind‑mount paths. Once the paths are correct the containers will start without error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
