CVE description: CVE-2017-3066 is a vulnerability in the Apache BlazeDS library that is bundled with Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw is an untrusted Java deserialization issue that allows an unauthenticated attacker to supply crafted serialized AMF/Java objects to a ColdFusion endpoint. When the malicious payload is deserialized, it can trigger arbitrary Java code execution on the server, resulting in full system compromise. Affected products are Adobe ColdFusion 10 (Update 22 and earlier), ColdFusion 11 (Update 11 and earlier), and ColdFusion 2016 (Update 3 and earlier). Adobe released hot‑fixes that update the embedded BlazeDS component (ColdFusion 2016 Update 4, ColdFusion 11 Update 12, ColdFusion 10 Update 23).

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the default httpd image you’re extending does not contain the mod_ssl module, so when the Dockerfile tries to copy a configuration that references modules/mod_ssl.so the image cannot find it and the container aborts. Switch the base to a variant that ships with SSL (e.g. httpd:2.4‑alpine or a later httpd:2.4.x release that includes mod_ssl), then install OpenSSL as you already do. With the proper image the LoadModule ssl_module directive resolves correctly and the build completes. In short, replace FROM httpd:2.4.23 with a version that includes mod_ssl (e.g. httpd:2.4.46) and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base **httpd:2.4.46** image you’re using is a minimal Debian‑based image that does not include the tools needed to create the self‑signed certificate and the certificate files end up owned by the non‑root `daemon` user, which prevents them from being written during the build. Fix the problem by doing the certificate generation while the container is still running as root, then switch back to the daemon user (or explicitly set the permissions) before copying the configuration. In practice you only need to add a `USER root` line before the `openssl` command, set restrictive permissions on the key (`chmod 600 /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key`), and then restore the original user with `USER daemon` after the copy steps. This ensures the key can be created and read by Apache at runtime and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container most likely fails because the Alpine‑based httpd image does not include the mod_ssl module that your httpd.conf tries to load; when Apache starts it cannot find modules/mod_ssl.so and aborts. Add the SSL module to the build (for example, after installing openssl run `apk add --no-cache apache2-mod_ssl`) and keep the image running as the default daemon user (or switch back to root only if you need to bind to port 443 before the drop‑privilege step). Rebuilding the image with the extra package installed will let Apache start correctly and serve both HTTP and HTTPS as intended.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine package you’re trying to install isn’t named `apache2-mod_ssl` in the `httpd:2.4‑alpine` image – the SSL module is provided by the `mod_ssl` package (the core Apache httpd image already contains the “httpd” binary, you only need the extra module). Change the `RUN apk add …` line in the Dockerfile to install the correct package, for example:

```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache openssl mod_ssl
```

After that the rest of the Dockerfile works unchanged – the self‑signed certificate is generated, the custom `httpd.conf` is copied, and the container can start with both ports 80 and 443 exposed. This adjustment resolves the image‑building error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based **httpd** image doesn’t provide a package called `mod_ssl`; the SSL module is already compiled into the image and you only need the OpenSSL binary to create the self‑signed certificate. Change the `apk add` line to install just OpenSSL (or, if you really need the extra Apache SSL package on Alpine, use `apache2-modssl`), then remove the extra `LoadModule ssl_module …` line if you keep the default module loading. After that the Dockerfile will look like:

```Dockerfile
FROM httpd:2.4-alpine

USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache openssl   # no mod_ssl package needed

RUN openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
        -keyout /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key \
        -x509 -days 365 \
        -out /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt \
        -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Org/OU=Dept/CN=localhost" && \
    chmod 600 /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key && \
    chmod 644 /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt && \
    chown daemon:daemon /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt

COPY httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
COPY htdocs/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
USER daemon
```

With the incorrect `mod_ssl` package removed (or replaced by the correct Alpine package name) the build proceeds normally. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely fails because the Alpine‑based httpd image does not include the SSL module by default, so the server can’t load the mod_ssl configuration you copied. Add an installation step for the SSL module (for example, `RUN apk add --no-cache apache2-mod_ssl`), then expose the ports explicitly with `EXPOSE 80 443` so they’re declared in the image, and rebuild the image. With the SSL module present and the ports exposed, the httpd service will start correctly and the compose file will be able to map both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely fails because the httpd process is switched to the non‑root **daemon** user after the certificate files are created, and that user cannot bind to the privileged ports 80 and 443, so the server aborts on start‑up. To fix it, keep the process running as root (remove the final `USER daemon` line or replace it with `USER root`) so that Apache can listen on the low‑numbered ports, or alternatively change the exposed ports to values above 1024 and update the `Listen` directives accordingly. After making that change rebuild the image and bring the service up again.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the Alpine‑based httpd:2.4‑alpine image does not ship with the SSL module, so the `LoadModule ssl_module …` lines in *httpd.conf* try to load a file that isn’t present and Apache aborts. Fix the image by installing the Apache SSL package (or switch to the non‑Alpine httpd image that already includes it) and then drop back to the normal “daemon” user before the server starts. In practice you can add a line such as `RUN apk add --no-cache apache2-mod-ssl` after the `apk add openssl` command, and after copying the configuration files insert `USER daemon` (or `USER www-data` depending on the base image) so that Apache runs with the expected UID. With the SSL module present and the process running under the correct user the service will start correctly on both ports 80 and 443.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based httpd image does not provide an `httpd-mod_ssl` package – the SSL module is either already built in or must be pulled from a different repository – so the `apk add … httpd-mod_ssl` step aborts. To fix it, change the base image to the Debian‑based variant (`FROM httpd:2.4`) and replace the Alpine package command with an APT one (`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssl`), keeping the rest of the Dockerfile identical; the `httpd` package in the Debian image already includes the SSL module, so you no longer need to install a separate mod_ssl package, and the subsequent `COPY` and `USER` steps will work without error.
