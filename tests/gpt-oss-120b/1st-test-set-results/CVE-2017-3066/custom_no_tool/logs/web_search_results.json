    "desc": "CVE-2017-3066 is a vulnerability in the Apache BlazeDS library that is bundled with Adobe ColdFusion. The flaw is an untrusted Java deserialization issue that allows an unauthenticated attacker to supply crafted serialized AMF/Java objects to a ColdFusion endpoint. When the malicious payload is deserialized, it can trigger arbitrary Java code execution on the server, resulting in full system compromise. Affected products are Adobe ColdFusion 10 (Update 22 and earlier), ColdFusion 11 (Update 11 and earlier), and ColdFusion 2016 (Update 3 and earlier). Adobe released hot\u2011fixes that update the embedded BlazeDS component (ColdFusion 2016 Update\u202f4, ColdFusion 11 Update\u202f12, ColdFusion 10 Update\u202f23).",
