CVE description: CVE‑2019‑9053 is a unauthenticated time‑based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the News module of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) versions up to and including 2.2.9. The flaw resides in the handling of the `m1_idlist` parameter which is concatenated directly into an SQL IN clause without proper sanitisation. An attacker can craft a request such as `,1))%20and%20sleep(5)#` that causes the database to pause, allowing the attacker to infer true/false conditions from the response delay. By iterating over character positions, the attacker can extract the entire CMS database, including administrator credentials, and ultimately gain full control of the CMS installation.
Attack Type: time based blind SQL injection

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The app container is probably failing because it tries to connect to MySQL before the database is fully initialized; the simple `depends_on` only orders startup, it doesn’t wait for readiness. To fix it, add a small wait‑for script (for example, download `wait-for-it.sh` into the app image and change the CMD to `./wait-for-it.sh db:3306 -- node server.js`) so the Node process only starts after MySQL is accepting connections. You can also upgrade the base Node image to a newer LTS version (e.g., `node:14` or `node:18`) to avoid any compatibility problems with the `mysql` client library. After rebuilding and redeploying the compose stack, the container should start correctly and the service will be reachable.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the app never starts is that the MySQL service never reports healthy because the health‑check runs `mysqladmin ping -h localhost` without any credentials, so it fails and the dependent app container stays paused. Change the health‑check in the compose file to include the root user and password (for example `test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "-uroot", "-prootpass", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]`). After that the DB will become healthy, the app’s wait‑for‑it script will succeed, and the Node container will connect normally. If the container still fails, double‑check that the `db_data` volume is correctly declared (the trailing colon after `db_data:` is optional) and that the init script is mounted at the expected path, but fixing the health‑check credentials usually resolves the startup problem.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The app container is likely failing because the wait‑for‑it.sh script needs nc to test the MySQL port, but the Node 18 base image doesn’t include netcat, so the script exits before node starts; add a small apt step to install netcat (e.g., RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y netcat && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) in the Dockerfile before copying the source, and keep the chmod +x line so the script stays executable. Also make sure the remote script isn’t overwritten by the local copy – either remove the local wait-for-it.sh or place the COPY . . after the chmod step so the executable permissions survive. After rebuilding the image the app container will wait for the DB healthcheck to succeed and then start node without crashing.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Node‑based image you start from doesn’t contain the classic “netcat” package name – on the slim Debian variant the executable is provided by the netcat‑openbsd package, so the `apt‑get install netcat` step aborts and the later `wait‑for‑it.sh` script can’t run. Change the Dockerfile to install the correct package (for example replace the line `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` with `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`). After that the script is available as `nc`, the health‑check can connect, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The app container is exiting because the `wait‑for‑it.sh` you invoke only waits 15 seconds for MySQL to become reachable, and the MySQL image often needs longer than that to initialise, so the script gives up and the `node server.js` command never runs. Fix it by giving the script a larger timeout (or by removing it entirely and relying on the retry logic already in `server.js`). The simplest change is to edit the `CMD` line in the Dockerfile to pass a longer‑wait option, for example:

```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "/usr/src/app/wait-for-it.sh", "db:3306", "-t", "60", "--", "node", "server.js"]
```

or, if you prefer to keep the original script unchanged, add an environment variable before the command:

```dockerfile
ENV WAIT_FOR_IT_TIMEOUT=60
CMD ["sh", "/usr/src/app/wait-for-it.sh", "db:3306", "--", "node", "server.js"]
```

Either approach lets the app container wait long enough for the MySQL service to become healthy, after which the Node server starts and the whole stack runs correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The composition only defines two services: an application container built from a Node.js image and a MySQL 5.7 database container. The required services list includes cmsms/cmsms, mysql, and php. The mysql service is present, but neither cmsms/cmsms nor php are used, so the “services_ok” milestone is not met. Additionally, the “code_hard_version” milestone requires the use of a cmsms/cmsms image with one of the specified versions (2.2.0‑2.2.9). No cmsms/cmsms image is used at all, therefore the required hard‑coded version condition is also not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The composition only defines two services: an application container built from a Node.js image and a MySQL 5.7 database container.

No cmsms/cmsms image is used at all, therefore the required hard‑coded version condition is also not satisfied.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services you need to add a cmsms service that uses one of the allowed cmsms/cmsms images (for example cmsms/cmsms:2.2.9) and a PHP service (such as php:7.4‑apache) that runs the CMS backend; the MySQL service can remain as is, but the cmsms container should be configured to connect to it via the same credentials and expose the web port, while the PHP container should be linked to the cmsms container (or run the CMS directly if you use a single php‑cmsms image). Then modify the app service’s depends_on section to include the new cmsms (and optionally php) services so Docker Compose starts the full stack, and adjust any environment variables or volume mounts needed for the CMS to access its configuration and data files. This brings the composition in line with the hard‑coded version and services‑ok milestones.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the node:18 base image does not contain Bash, yet the Dockerfile sets the container’s command to run bash and the downloaded wait‑for‑it.sh script relies on Bash‑specific syntax; installing Bash (e.g., adding apt‑get install -y bash to the Dockerfile) and then invoking it (or switching the CMD to use sh if you prefer not to add Bash) resolves the problem. You can keep the ADD that pulls the script from GitHub, but make sure Bash is present before the CMD line, so the container can start the wait‑for‑it script and then launch node as intended.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because `ADD` is being used to pull a plain *.sh* file from a remote URL – Docker only treats remote URLs as tar archives, so it cannot copy the script and aborts with “not a tar archive”. Replace the `ADD` line in the app Dockerfile with a `RUN curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it/master/wait-for-it.sh -o /usr/src/app/wait-for-it.sh && chmod +x /usr/src/app/wait-for-it.sh`; this downloads the script correctly and makes it executable, letting the image build to completion. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `wait‑for‑it.sh` script that the container tries to run is never actually present or executable when the image is built – the Dockerfile both copies a local copy of the script and then overwrites it with `curl`, but the script’s permissions aren’t guaranteed and the arguments you pass (`-t 60`) aren’t recognised by the version you downloaded, causing the entrypoint to exit immediately. The quickest fix is to stop downloading a second copy, make the one you already ship executable, and adjust the `CMD` so it calls the script with the correct syntax. Replace the two lines that curl the script with a single `RUN chmod +x wait-for-it.sh`, and change the `CMD` to `["bash","/usr/src/app/wait-for-it.sh","db:3306","--","node","server.js"]` (or use the script’s original timeout flag `-t 60` only if you add that handling). With the script reliably present and executable, the image builds and the container can wait for MySQL before starting the Node app.
