    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20119053 is a unauthenticated time\u2011based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the News module of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) versions up to and including 2.2.9. The flaw resides in the handling of the `m1_idlist` parameter which is concatenated directly into an SQL IN clause without proper sanitisation. An attacker can craft a request such as `,1))%20and%20sleep(5)#` that causes the database to pause, allowing the attacker to infer true/false conditions from the response delay. By iterating over character positions, the attacker can extract the entire CMS database, including administrator credentials, and ultimately gain full control of the CMS installation.",
