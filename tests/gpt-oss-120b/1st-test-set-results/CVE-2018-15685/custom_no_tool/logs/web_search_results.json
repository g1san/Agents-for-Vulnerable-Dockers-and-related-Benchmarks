    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201115685 is a privilege\u2011escalation vulnerability in the Electron framework. When a new BrowserWindow or iframe is created with the options `nativeWindowOpen:true` or `sandbox:true`, Electron fails to correctly inherit the parent window\u2019s `webPreferences`. The child window falls back to insecure defaults where `nodeIntegration` is enabled and `contextIsolation` is disabled. An attacker who can inject JavaScript into a renderer process (for example via cross\u2011site scripting or by loading untrusted remote content) can modify the shared `webPreferences` object or trigger the creation of a privileged child window. The compromised window obtains full Node.js bindings, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary native code on the host machine with the same privileges as the Electron application. The vulnerability affects specific older Electron releases and was fixed by cloning the `webPreferences` object in later versions.",
