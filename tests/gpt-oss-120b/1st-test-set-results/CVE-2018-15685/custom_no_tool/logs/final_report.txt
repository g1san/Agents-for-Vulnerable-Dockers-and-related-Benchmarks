CVE description: CVE‑2018‑15685 is a privilege‑escalation vulnerability in the Electron framework. When a new BrowserWindow or iframe is created with the options `nativeWindowOpen:true` or `sandbox:true`, Electron fails to correctly inherit the parent window’s `webPreferences`. The child window falls back to insecure defaults where `nodeIntegration` is enabled and `contextIsolation` is disabled. An attacker who can inject JavaScript into a renderer process (for example via cross‑site scripting or by loading untrusted remote content) can modify the shared `webPreferences` object or trigger the creation of a privileged child window. The compromised window obtains full Node.js bindings, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary native code on the host machine with the same privileges as the Electron application. The vulnerability affects specific older Electron releases and was fixed by cloning the `webPreferences` object in later versions.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][electron][['1.7.15', '1.8.7', '2.0.7', '3.0.0-beta.6']] Electron runtime containing the vulnerable webPreferences handling. These specific versions exhibit the inheritance bug that allows a compromised renderer to gain Node.js privileges and execute arbitrary code.
- [SOFT-BASE][node][['12.22.12']] Node.js runtime required by the Electron image to run the application code. Any compatible version works with the selected Electron versions.
- [SOFT-BASE][alpine][['3.16']] Lightweight Linux base image providing the operating system libraries for the container. Used to build a minimal Docker image that runs the vulnerable Electron runtime.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition uses only nginx:1.15.0 and alpine:3.9. Neither electron nor node services are present, so the required services list ['electron','node','alpine'] is not satisfied (missing electron and node). Moreover, no electron image is used, thus no vulnerable electron version from the list is employed. Hence both milestones fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition uses only nginx:1.15.0 and alpine:3.9. Neither electron nor node services are present, so the required services list ['electron','node','alpine'] is not satisfied (missing electron and node). Moreover, no electron image is used, thus no vulnerable electron version from the list is employed. Hence both milestones fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services, replace the current victim service with an Electron‑based image that includes the vulnerable versions (for example electron:2.0.7 or build a custom image from alpine:3.16 that installs Node 12.22.12 and Electron 2.0.7), and add a separate container for the Node runtime if you prefer to keep them distinct. Update the docker‑compose.yml so the victim service uses this new image and expose the appropriate port, while retaining the attacker service as‑is; this will provide the missing “electron” and “node” components and allow the composition to meet the specified service list.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails while installing the vulnerable Electron package because the Alpine base image does not contain the native‑build toolchain required to compile Electron’s binary modules. Add the necessary build dependencies before the `npm install` line (e.g., `apk add --no‑cache python3 make g++ libc6-compat`) and then, after the install completes, remove them to keep the image lightweight. Also make sure the startup script is executable – either add `RUN chmod +x /usr/src/app/start.sh` in the Dockerfile or change the `CMD` to invoke it with `sh`. With those two tweaks the Dockerfile will build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine version used in the victim image (the default for node 12.22.12‑alpine) does not provide the libraries that Electron 2.0.7 needs to compile its native modules. Switch the base to a newer Alpine release that matches the one referenced elsewhere (e.g. node:12.22.12‑alpine3.16), install the build‑time packages, install Electron and http‑server, and only then remove the build tools. In practice you would modify the Dockerfile so the first line reads `FROM node:12.22.12-alpine3.16`, keep the `apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ libc6-compat` line, run `npm install -g electron@2.0.7 http-server`, and finally execute `apk del python3 make g++ libc6-compat`. This provides the required runtime libraries and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the temporary build‑time packages are removed before the Electron binary’s required libraries are installed, so the `npm install -g electron@2.0.7` step can’t complete successfully. Fix it by installing the build tools in a virtual package, running the npm install with `--unsafe-perm` (since the Dockerfile runs as root), and then deleting that virtual package after the install, for example: replace the single‑line `apk add … && npm install … && apk del …` with `apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps python3 make g++ libc6-compat && npm install -g --unsafe-perm electron@2.0.7 http-server && apk del .build-deps`. This keeps the needed libraries until after Electron is built and eliminates the missing‑dependency error.
