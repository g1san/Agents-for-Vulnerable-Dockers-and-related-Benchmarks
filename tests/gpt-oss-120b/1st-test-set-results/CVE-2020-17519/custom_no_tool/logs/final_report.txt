CVE description: CVE-2020-17519 is a directory‑traversal vulnerability in Apache Flink's JobManager REST API. The vulnerable component is the JobManagerCustomLogHandler, which builds a java.io.File object from the raw path parameter supplied in the HTTP request without any sanitization. An unauthenticated attacker can supply URL‑encoded "../" sequences (e.g., "..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd") to cause the JobManager to read an arbitrary file that the process has permission to access. The file contents are returned directly in the HTTP response, allowing disclosure of configuration files, credentials, source code, or any other readable data on the host. The flaw exists in Apache Flink versions 1.11.0, 1.11.1, and 1.11.2 and is fixed in version 1.11.3 and later.
Attack Type: Arbitrary File Read
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/flink][['1.11.0', '1.11.1', '1.11.2']] Apache Flink provides the JobManager with the vulnerable REST endpoint on port 8081. Running one of the listed vulnerable versions makes the Docker environment susceptible to CVE-2020-17519.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image can’t compile the mysqli extension without the required system libraries, so you need to install the MySQL client headers (e.g., default‑mysql‑client or libmariadb‑dev) before running docker-php-ext-install. Update the Dockerfile to run an apt‑get update, install the needed packages (such as default‑mysql‑client and any build‑essential tools), and then invoke docker-php-ext-install mysqli; for example, add a line like `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libzip-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && docker-php-ext-enable mysqli`. After the dependencies are installed the image will compile successfully and the container will start normally.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image is missing the MySQL client libraries required for the mysqli extension; the easiest fix is to install the client packages before invoking docker‑php‑ext‑install and to clean up the apt cache afterward. Modify the Dockerfile so the RUN line first updates the package index, installs default‑mysql‑client (and any other needed dev libraries), then runs docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli (the enable step is optional because the extension is auto‑loaded), and finally removes the apt lists; after that the rest of the Dockerfile (copying the source) can stay unchanged. This ensures the mysqli extension compiles successfully and the image builds without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines a web service based on the php:8.2-apache image, which provides the Apache HTTP server (version 2.4.x) and not Apache Flink. No Flink component is present in any of the images or services. Consequently, the required service 'apache/flink' is not used, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail. Additionally, because no Apache Flink version is present, the code does not use any of the listed vulnerable Flink versions (1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2), so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.

	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you must replace the current PHP‑Apache service with a true Apache Flink deployment that runs one of the vulnerable versions (for example flink:1.11.2). In the docker‑compose.yml file change the web service to use the Flink image, expose the JobManager REST port 8081, and add the TaskManager service as required; remove the PHP‑specific build context and the MySQL sidecar unless it is still needed for ancillary testing. By swapping the PHP container for a Flink JobManager (and optionally a TaskManager) running version 1.11.0‑1.11.2, the composition will now contain the apache/flink service at a vulnerable version, allowing the “services_ok” and “code_hard_version” checks to pass.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The JobManager container correctly maps its default UI port 8081 ("8081:8081"). However, the TaskManager container does not publish any of its default network ports. Its inspect data shows ExposedPorts 6123/tcp and 8081/tcp but the "PortBindings" section is empty, meaning these ports are not bound to the host and are not reachable from outside the Docker network. Consequently, not all services are set up to be accessible on their expected ports.

Its inspect data shows ExposedPorts 6123/tcp and 8081/tcp but the "PortBindings" section is empty, meaning these ports are not bound to the host and are not reachable from outside the Docker network. Consequently, not all services are set up to be accessible on their expected ports.
	- FIX: Add a “ports” block to the taskmanager service in docker‑compose.yml that maps the internal Flink ports to the host, for example:

```yaml
taskmanager:
  image: flink:1.11.2
  depends_on:
    - jobmanager
  environment:
    - JOB_MANAGER_RPC_ADDRESS=jobmanager
  command: taskmanager
  ports:
    - "6123:6123"
    - "8081:8081"
```

This publishes the taskmanager’s RPC port (6123) and its REST UI port (8081) to the host so they are reachable outside the Docker network. After updating the compose file, redeploy the stack (docker‑compose down && docker‑compose up -d) and the services will be accessible on the expected ports.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image does not have the MySQL client development headers needed to compile the mysqli extension – installing only the client binary isn’t enough. Edit the Dockerfile to add the dev package (e.g. default-libmysqlclient-dev or mariadb-dev depending on the distro) before running docker-php-ext-install mysqli, then clean up the apt cache as before. While you’re editing the compose file, remove the extra “8081:8081” port mapping from the taskmanager service to avoid a port‑collision with the jobmanager container. After those two changes the image should build and the stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The MySQL container does not expose its default port 3306 (no ports mapping is defined), so it is not accessible from the expected network port. All other services map their default ports (jobmanager 8081, taskmanager 6123, php_app 80), but the missing MySQL port causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The MySQL container does not expose its default port 3306 (no ports mapping is defined), so it is not accessible from the expected network port. All other services map their default ports (jobmanager 8081, taskmanager 6123, php_app 80), but the missing MySQL port causes the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: Add a port mapping for the MySQL service in the compose file, for example under the mysql service include `ports: - "3306:3306"`. This exposes the database’s default port on the host so external components can reach it, while the internal service name and credentials already used by php_app remain unchanged. After adding the mapping, restart the stack and the network‑setup check will succeed.
