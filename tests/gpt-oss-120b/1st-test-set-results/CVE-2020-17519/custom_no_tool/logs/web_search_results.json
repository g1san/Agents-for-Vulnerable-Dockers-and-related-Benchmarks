    "desc": "CVE-2020-17519 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Apache Flink's JobManager REST API. The vulnerable component is the JobManagerCustomLogHandler, which builds a java.io.File object from the raw path parameter supplied in the HTTP request without any sanitization. An unauthenticated attacker can supply URL\u2011encoded \"../\" sequences (e.g., \"..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd\") to cause the JobManager to read an arbitrary file that the process has permission to access. The file contents are returned directly in the HTTP response, allowing disclosure of configuration files, credentials, source code, or any other readable data on the host. The flaw exists in Apache Flink versions 1.11.0, 1.11.1, and 1.11.2 and is fixed in version 1.11.3 and later.",
