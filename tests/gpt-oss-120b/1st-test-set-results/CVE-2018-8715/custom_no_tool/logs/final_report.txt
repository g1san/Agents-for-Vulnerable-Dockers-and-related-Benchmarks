CVE description: CVE‑2018‑8715 is an authentication‑bypass vulnerability in the Embedthis AppWeb web server. A logic flaw in the authentication handler (function authCondition in httpLib.c) allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request that includes only a valid username and omits the password. The server creates a session and marks the request as authenticated without verifying the password. This bypass works for both Digest and Form authentication mechanisms. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can obtain an authenticated session and gain full access to the protected resources of the web application, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The flaw affects all AppWeb releases prior to version 7.0.3, including the 5.5.x series, the 6.x series, and early 7.x releases. The vulnerability can be exploited by any client that can reach the HTTP service; no additional components are required.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build failure, replace the tar‑extraction step with a safe extraction that blocks path‑traversal entries—for example, change the Dockerfile RUN line to `RUN mkdir /exploit && tar --no-same-owner --no-same-permissions --strip-components=1 -xf /malicious.tar -C /exploit` after first inspecting the archive, or simply remove the malicious.tar copy entirely if it isn’t needed for the test. Additionally, drop the `privileged: true` flag in the compose file unless it is absolutely required, as it can amplify any unintended file writes from the container. These adjustments prevent the container from trying to overwrite host files and allow the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile uses only the base image alpine:3.9 and does not include the embedthis/appweb service, which is required for the 'services_ok' milestone. Consequently, the defined services list ['embedthis/appweb', 'docker'] is not satisfied. Since embedthis/appweb is not present, the image cannot be using any of its listed vulnerable versions, so 'code_hard_version' is also false.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile uses only the base image alpine:3.9 and does not include the embedthis/appweb service, which is required for the 'services_ok' milestone. Consequently, the defined services list ['embedthis/appweb', 'docker'] is not satisfied. Since embedthis/appweb is not present, the image cannot be using any of its listed vulnerable versions, so 'code_hard_version' is also false.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required service list, replace the generic Alpine base with the official embedthis/appweb image at a vulnerable version (for example embedthis/appweb:6.0.4) or start from Alpine and install the specific AppWeb binaries for one of the vulnerable releases, then configure the container to run the AppWeb server on port 80. In the docker‑compose.yml keep the port mapping 8080:80 so the service is reachable, and ensure the Dockerfile exposes the correct entrypoint (e.g., CMD ["appweb","-c","appweb.conf"] or the appropriate start script). This change introduces the missing hard‑dependency while preserving the existing compose layout.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile does not actually add anything beyond an EXPOSE line, so Docker tries to use the base image’s default CMD but the embedthis/appweb:6.0.4 tag either does not exist in the registry or the image lacks a usable entrypoint, causing the build to abort. To fix it, either drop the custom Dockerfile entirely and let the compose file pull the pre‑built embedthis/appweb:6.0.4 image directly, or update the Dockerfile to reference a valid, existing tag (for example embedthis/appweb:7.0.3 or a newer‑available version) and add an explicit CMD or ENTRYPOINT that starts the AppWeb server (such as CMD ["appweb","-c","/etc/appweb.conf"]). After correcting the tag and ensuring a proper command is defined, the image will build and the compose stack will start without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile expects a file called `appweb.conf` in the build context, but that file isn’t being found (or is placed in the wrong directory), and the base image tag `embedthis/appweb:7.0.3` either doesn’t exist on Docker Hub or doesn’t contain the expected entry point. To fix it, place the `appweb.conf` file next to the Dockerfile (or adjust the `COPY` path to where the file actually lives) and verify that the base image tag is valid—if the tag is missing, switch to a known‑working tag such as `embedthis/appweb:7.0.2` or the latest stable version. Finally, make sure the `CMD` matches the binary provided by the image; you can replace `["appweb", "-c", "/etc/appweb.conf"]` with the exact command documented for the chosen tag (often just `["appweb"]` when the config is in the default location). After these changes, rerun `docker compose up --build` and the image should build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile copies appweb.conf to /etc/appweb.conf but the base embedthis/appweb:7.0.2 image does not create an /etc directory for custom configuration, so the copy step cannot find the target location. To fix it, add a `RUN mkdir -p /etc` (or `RUN install -d /etc`) before the `COPY` line, ensuring the destination folder exists, and then keep the existing `COPY appweb.conf /etc/appweb.conf`. If the image also expects a document root at `/var/appweb/www`, you should add a `RUN mkdir -p /var/appweb/www && echo "Test page" > /var/appweb/www/index.html` so the server has something to serve and the container won’t exit immediately. Once these directories are created, the image will build successfully and the container will start with AppWeb reading the supplied configuration.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to copy `appweb.conf` into `/etc/appweb.conf` but the source file isn’t found at the path expected by the build context; the `COPY` line therefore aborts the image creation. To fix it, make sure the configuration file is located next to the Dockerfile (or adjust the path in the `COPY` instruction to point to the actual location), then copy it into a directory that actually exists in the image—creating that directory first if necessary. For example, add `RUN mkdir -p /etc/appweb` before the `COPY` line and change the copy command to `COPY appweb.conf /etc/appweb/appweb.conf`. This ensures the file is present during the build and placed where the subsequent `CMD ["appweb", "-c", "/etc/appweb/appweb.conf"]` can find it, allowing the image to be built successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The problem is likely caused by the compose file trying to mount a configuration file that the container cannot find or read, which aborts the start‑up. To fix it, make sure the path `./appweb.conf` exists relative to the compose file and that the file permissions allow the container’s user to read it (e.g., `chmod 644 appweb.conf`). If the image expects the configuration at a different location, adjust the mount line to match the actual path inside the container (for example, change `- ./appweb.conf:/etc/appweb.conf:ro` to `- ./appweb.conf:/usr/local/appweb/conf/appweb.conf:ro` if that is where AppWeb looks). If you need to customize the image (for example, to add a default document root), create a small Dockerfile that copies the config into the image, build it with `docker build -t myappweb .`, and point the compose service to that image instead of the upstream one. After correcting the mount path and permissions, `docker compose up -d` should start the vulnerable container without terminating.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the AppWeb source expects several development libraries that aren’t present in the plain Alpine base; during the ./configure step it aborts, so the subsequent make never runs. To fix it, extend the apk add line to pull in the missing headers (for example openssl-dev pcre-dev zlib-dev and linux-headers) along with the existing build-base and curl. After those packages are installed the configure script will complete successfully and the build will finish. If the binary still isn’t found at runtime, adjust the final CMD to use the full path returned by the install (e.g., /usr/local/bin/appweb instead of just appweb). Once those changes are applied, rebuild the image and the compose stack should start without errors.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file is trying to run a container from the pre‑built `embedthis/appweb:7.0.2` image while you also have a Dockerfile that attempts to compile the same vulnerable version from source; the two approaches conflict and the Dockerfile pulls in a lot of development packages that aren’t needed for the test environment. The quickest fix is to pick one method and remove the other: either let Docker Compose build the image from the Dockerfile (replace `image: embedthis/appweb:7.0.2` with `build: .`), or skip the Dockerfile altogether and simply use the official vulnerable image (delete the Dockerfile and any related build steps). If you keep the source‑build route, you should also trim the `apk add` line to only the packages required for compilation (e.g., `apk add --no-cache build-base curl openssl-dev pcre-dev zlib-dev linux-headers`) and ensure the `RUN` commands are chained correctly. In short, align the compose service with a single, coherent image source—either the official pre‑built image or the custom‑built one—to eliminate the build‑time error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
