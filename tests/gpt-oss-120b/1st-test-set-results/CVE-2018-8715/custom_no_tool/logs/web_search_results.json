    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20118715 is an authentication\u2011bypass vulnerability in the Embedthis AppWeb web server. A logic flaw in the authentication handler (function authCondition in httpLib.c) allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request that includes only a valid username and omits the password. The server creates a session and marks the request as authenticated without verifying the password. This bypass works for both Digest and Form authentication mechanisms. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can obtain an authenticated session and gain full access to the protected resources of the web application, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The flaw affects all AppWeb releases prior to version 7.0.3, including the 5.5.x series, the 6.x series, and early 7.x releases. The vulnerability can be exploited by any client that can reach the HTTP service; no additional components are required.",
