## CVE‑2018‑8715 Test Environment

This Docker setup provides a reproducible environment for the **Embedthis AppWeb** authentication‑bypass vulnerability (CVE‑2018‑8715).

### How it works
- The `docker‑compose.yml` now builds a custom image from the provided `Dockerfile`, avoiding the need for a pre‑built image that may not be publicly available.
- The supplied `appweb.conf` is mounted into the container at `/etc/appweb.conf`.
- Port **8080** on the host is mapped to port **80** inside the container, so you can reach the web server at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Usage
```bash
# From the directory containing this compose file:
sudo docker compose up -d
```

The service will start automatically; no additional manual steps are required.

### Stopping the environment
```bash
sudo docker compose down
```

Feel free to modify `appweb.conf` to explore different authentication settings or to add test files under the document root.
