CVE description: CVE‑2016‑1897 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework (including Libav forks) that affects the handling of the *concat* protocol when parsing HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlists (M3U8 files). The parser accepts URLs from playlist entries without proper validation and can combine a remote URL with the first line of a local file. When a crafted playlist is processed, FFmpeg issues an outbound HTTP request that contains data read from an arbitrary local file on the host. This results in a server‑side request forgery condition that can be abused to leak confidential file contents (partial confidentiality breach). No privileged access or user interaction is required; the exploit runs automatically when the vulnerable FFmpeg binary processes the malicious media file.
Attack Type: Server Side Request Forgery
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ffmpeg][['2.8', '2.8.1', '2.8.2', '2.8.3', '2.8.4', '2.7', '2.6', '2.5', '2.4', '2.3', '2.2', '2.1', '2.0']] Core vulnerable component; the HLS playlist parser in these FFmpeg versions allows unsafe concat protocol handling leading to server‑side request forgery and arbitrary file read.
- [SOFT][alpine][['3.18']] Lightweight Linux base image required to run the FFmpeg binary inside a Docker container.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container 'vulnerable' does not define any ports in the Docker Compose file and the inspect output shows an empty PortBindings and Ports map. Consequently, no service is exposed on the host network, so the services are not accessible via their intended network ports.
	- ERROR: The container 'vulnerable' does not define any ports in the Docker Compose file and the inspect output shows an empty PortBindings and Ports map. Consequently, no service is exposed on the host network, so the services are not accessible via their intended network ports.
	- FIX: To expose a service you need to declare the desired port mapping in the compose file—add a ports section under the vulnerable service (for example ports: - "8080:8080") so Docker creates the HostPort → ContainerPort binding; alternatively you can set network_mode: "host" if you want the container to share the host’s network stack directly. Including an EXPOSE instruction in the Dockerfile for the same port is optional but helps document the intended listening port. After updating the compose file and redeploying, the service will be reachable on the specified host port.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs ffmpeg via 'apk add' without specifying a version, and the base image is alpine:3.5. The exact ffmpeg version present in Alpine 3.5 is not provided, so it cannot be verified that it matches any of the vulnerable versions listed (2.0‑2.8.x). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails, while both required services (ffmpeg and alpine) are present, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile installs ffmpeg via 'apk add' without specifying a version, and the base image is alpine:3.5. The exact ffmpeg version present in Alpine 3.5 is not provided, so it cannot be verified that it matches any of the vulnerable versions listed (2.0‑2.8.x). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails, while both required services (ffmpeg and alpine) are present, satisfying the 'services_ok' milestone.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you need to pin the ffmpeg package to a version that is known to be vulnerable (for example ffmpeg‑2.8.4) and base the image on an Alpine release that provides that package – Alpine 3.18 is the required version according to the services list. Change the Dockerfile to use FROM alpine:3.18 and modify the install line to RUN apk add --no-cache ffmpeg=2.8.4-r0 (or the exact package release that contains the 2.8.x series). This ensures the image contains a verifiable vulnerable ffmpeg version while still providing the same functionality. The rest of the compose file can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine 3.18 package repositories no longer contain the exact `ffmpeg=2.8.4‑r0` binary you’re trying to install, so `apk` cannot resolve the dependency. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so that it either installs the default ffmpeg version that ships with Alpine 3.18 or pulls the needed old version from a repository that actually provides it (for example the `edge/testing` repo). A quick fix is to drop the version pin and let `apk` install the current package:

```
FROM alpine:3.18
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache ffmpeg curl
COPY exploit.sh /exploit.sh
RUN chmod +x /exploit.sh
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["/exploit.sh"]
```

If you really need the 2.8.x series, add the appropriate repository line before the install (e.g. `echo "http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing" >> /etc/apk/repositories`), then install the specific version. After updating the Dockerfile, rebuild the image and the error should disappear.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs ffmpeg from the Alpine 3.18 package repository without pinning a specific version. Alpine 3.18 provides a recent ffmpeg release that is not among the listed vulnerable versions (2.x series). Therefore the image does not use a vulnerable ffmpeg version. Both required services (ffmpeg and alpine) are present, so services_ok is true.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile installs ffmpeg from the Alpine 3.18 package repository without pinning a specific version. Alpine 3.18 provides a recent ffmpeg release that is not among the listed vulnerable versions (2.x series). Therefore the image does not use a vulnerable ffmpeg version. Both required services (ffmpeg and alpine) are present, so services_ok is true.
	- FIX: To ensure the container actually reproduces CVE‑2016‑1897, change the Dockerfile to install a specific vulnerable ffmpeg version from the 2.x series (for example, 2.8.4) instead of the latest package; this can be done by adding the exact version number to the apk add line or by pulling the appropriate binary from an archive. After installing the correct ffmpeg release, remove the unnecessary privileged flag and host‑root volume mount unless they are required for a controlled demonstration, keeping only the components needed to trigger the concat‑protocol bug. This modification guarantees the image contains the vulnerable ffmpeg while preserving the intended exploit flow.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine base image does not have the root certificates needed for HTTPS downloads, so the `curl` step cannot fetch the static FFmpeg tarball and the subsequent `tar` command runs on an empty file. To fix it, just add the `ca-certificates` package (and optionally `openssl` for TLS) to the install line in the Dockerfile before you run `curl`. After installing the certificates, the download succeeds, the archive can be extracted, and the binary can be moved into `/usr/local/bin`. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the archive you download extracts to a directory whose name does not match the hard‑coded path in the Dockerfile, so the `mv` command cannot find the binary; fixing it is just a matter of extracting the tarball with `--strip-components=1` (or adjusting the target path) so that the `ffmpeg` executable ends up at `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`. Change the `RUN` line to something like `curl -L "$FFMPEG_URL" -o /tmp/ffmpeg.tar.xz && tar -xf /tmp/ffmpeg.tar.xz -C /tmp && mv /tmp/ffmpeg-2.8.4-64bit-static/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg && rm -rf /tmp/*` or, more robustly, `tar -xf /tmp/ffmpeg.tar.xz -C /usr/local/bin --strip-components=1 ffmpeg-2.8.4-64bit-static/ffmpeg` so the binary is placed directly where you expect. After that the rest of the Dockerfile and the entrypoint script work unchanged and the container can be built successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile assumes a fixed directory name inside the tarball (“ffmpeg-2.8.4-64bit-static”), but the archive actually extracts to a slightly different path (for example “ffmpeg‑2.8.4‑64bit‑static‑linux”); as a result the `mv` command can’t find the binary and the layer aborts. Fix it by not hard‑coding the extracted folder name – after extracting, locate the ffmpeg executable with a wildcard (e.g. `mv /tmp/ffmpeg-*/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`) or use `find` to copy the binary. Also clean up only the archive file (rather than `rm -rf /tmp/*`) to avoid inadvertently deleting the extracted directory before the move. With these two adjustments the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the static ffmpeg binary needs the C++ runtime libraries that aren’t present in a vanilla Alpine 3.18 image; adding the `libstdc++` package (and any other missing shared libraries such as `libgcc`) before moving the binary into `/usr/local/bin` resolves the issue. In practice you just extend the `apk add` line in the Dockerfile to include `libstdc++` (and optionally `libgcc`) and then rebuild, which supplies the required runtime dependencies and allows the container to start correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the static ffmpeg binary you download is compiled against glibc, while the Alpine base image only provides musl, so required symbols are missing at runtime and the binary cannot be executed; to fix it, either switch the base image to a glibc‑based distro such as debian:bullseye (changing `FROM alpine:3.18` to `FROM debian:bullseye-slim` and adjusting the package manager commands to `apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl xz-utils libstdc++`) or replace the downloaded ffmpeg with a version built for musl (for example, pulling an Alpine‑compatible ffmpeg package from the Alpine repositories). After ensuring the binary matches the libc of the base image, the rest of the Dockerfile (copying the exploit script, exposing port 8080 and setting the entrypoint) will build and run correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
