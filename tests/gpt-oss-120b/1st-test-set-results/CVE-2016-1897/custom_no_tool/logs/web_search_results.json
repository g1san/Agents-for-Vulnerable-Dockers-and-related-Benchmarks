    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20111897 is a vulnerability in the FFmpeg multimedia framework (including Libav forks) that affects the handling of the *concat* protocol when parsing HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlists (M3U8 files). The parser accepts URLs from playlist entries without proper validation and can combine a remote URL with the first line of a local file. When a crafted playlist is processed, FFmpeg issues an outbound HTTP request that contains data read from an arbitrary local file on the host. This results in a server\u2011side request forgery condition that can be abused to leak confidential file contents (partial confidentiality breach). No privileged access or user interaction is required; the exploit runs automatically when the vulnerable FFmpeg binary processes the malicious media file.",
