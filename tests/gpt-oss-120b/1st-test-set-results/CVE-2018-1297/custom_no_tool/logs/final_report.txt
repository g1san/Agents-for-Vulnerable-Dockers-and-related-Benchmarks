CVE description: Apache JMeter versions 2.x and 3.x expose an RMI registry (default TCP port 1099) for the Distributed Test feature. The registry provides an unauthenticated reference to the JMeterEngine object. An attacker who can reach this RMI endpoint can send a crafted Java serialized payload, which is deserialized by the JMeter process. The deserialization triggers execution of attacker‑controlled code, granting remote code execution with the privileges of the JMeter process. The flaw exists in the RemoteWorker component and the JMeterEngine RMI communication and is fixed only in JMeter 4.0 and later.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/jmeter][['2.9', '2.10', '2.11', '2.12', '2.13', '2.14', '3.0', '3.1', '3.2', '3.3', '3.4', '3.5']] Core JMeter server that runs the vulnerable RemoteWorker RMI service exposing the JMeterEngine object without authentication, which is required for the CVE‑2018‑1297 exploitation.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the `exploit_runner` container never gets to the point where it can execute the attack is that the Alpine image you’re using does not contain the Docker CLI, so the `docker` commands in `exploit.sh` simply fail. Fix it by switching the `exploit_runner` image to one that already ships the Docker client (for example `docker:18.06.1-cli`), or by installing the client inside the Alpine container during startup (e.g., `apk add --no‑cache docker`). Once the CLI is present, the script will be able to connect to the vulnerable daemon through the `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375` variable you already set, and the rest of the exploit will run as intended.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the exploit‑runner container does not have the privileges required to create the overlay filesystem that the malicious Dockerfile needs, so the “docker build” step aborts. To fix it, add `privileged: true` to the `exploit_runner` service definition in the compose file (just as the vulnerable_dind service already has) and then re‑run the stack; the privileged flag gives the client container the kernel capabilities it needs to build and run the attack image, allowing the script to complete without error. (No other changes are required.)


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the compose stack won’t start is that the vulnerable_dind service isn’t actually listening on the TCP port you expose (2375), so the exploit_runner cannot reach the daemon via DOCKER_HOST. Edit docker-compose.yml so that the vulnerable_dind service runs the Docker daemon with an explicit TCP listener, e.g. add command: dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock under the vulnerable_dind definition (the existing DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR= environment line already disables TLS). After rebuilding and restarting the stack, the exploit container will be able to connect to tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375 and the script should execute correctly. If the container still fails, verify that the exploit.sh file has Unix line endings and that the Dockerfile.attack build succeeds, then re‑run docker‑compose up to confirm the services are healthy.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is most likely caused by the fact that the vulnerable_dind service is built from a Dockerfile that references the tag docker:18.06.1-dind, which does not exist in the official Docker registry; the correct image name is docker:18.06.1‑dind‑rootless or you must pull the exact docker:18.06.1‑dind image before building. Pull the proper base image (for example, run docker pull docker:18.06.1-dind or change the FROM line to a valid tag) and then rebuild the vulnerable_dind service. After that, the exploit_runner container will be able to connect to the daemon via tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375 and the compose stack will start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the exploit script tries to contact the remote Docker daemon before the “vulnerable_dind” service is fully up and listening on tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375, so the `docker pull`, `docker build` and later `docker run` commands return connection‑refused errors. The fix is simply to make the script wait for the daemon to become healthy before proceeding – for example, insert a short loop that runs `docker --host=tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375 info` (or `nc -z vulnerable_dind 2375`) until it succeeds, then continue with the pull, build and run steps. No other changes to the Dockerfiles are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `docker build -t attack-image -f Dockerfile.attack .` command is run from inside the `exploit_runner` container, whose working directory is the root of the compose project, while the Docker daemon’s build context is limited to the **vulnerable_dind** directory (the only directory that was sent to the daemon when the `vulnerable_dind` service was built). Since `Dockerfile.attack` doesn’t exist inside that context, the daemon returns “file not found” and the compose run aborts.

To fix it, generate the Dockerfile inside the build context that the daemon actually sees and tell Docker to use that directory as the context. The simplest change is to replace the two‑line build step in `exploit.sh` with an inline build that feeds the Dockerfile via stdin, for example:

```sh
docker build -t attack-image - <<'EOF'
FROM alpine:3.12
RUN mkdir /hostfs
EOF
```

Because the Dockerfile is provided on the command line, no external “Dockerfile.attack” file is needed, and the build succeeds regardless of the current working directory. Additionally, make sure `exploit.sh` is executable (e.g., `chmod +x exploit.sh`) so the entrypoint can run it. With these two small adjustments the compose stack will start and the exploit script will run without the image‑building error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack never gets to the point where the exploit runs is that the “vulnerable_dind” service never finishes starting the Docker daemon – the custom command overrides the image’s entrypoint and leaves the daemon running without the required PID file and socket, so the client in exploit_runner times out waiting for docker info. Remove the explicit command line (or replace it with the proper dockerd‑entrypoint.sh wrapper) and let the dind image start Docker in its default way, keeping DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR= to disable TLS, and keep the ports mapping of 2375:2375. With the daemon starting correctly, the exploit_runner container will be able to reach tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375 via the DOCKER_HOST environment variable and the rest of the script will execute as intended.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The vulnerable‑dind service isn’t staying up because the daemon never starts listening on the TCP socket before the exploit runner attempts to connect, so add a small healthcheck that waits for the daemon to be ready and make the compose file wait for that healthcheck instead of the simple loop; also give the exploit runner the SYS_ADMIN capability (or run it privileged as you already do) and explicitly set the DOCKER_HOST environment variable in the runner’s entrypoint script before invoking any docker commands, for example by inserting `export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://vulnerable_dind:2375` at the top of exploit.sh; finally, change the Dockerfile for the attack image to copy the exploit script into the image and run it directly so there’s no dependency on the host’s docker binary, which eliminates the race condition that was causing the container to fail to start.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the inline Dockerfile is being fed to `docker build` without a build context, and the CLI expects a directory argument after the Dockerfile source. Change the build command in `exploit.sh` to supply an empty context (the current directory) and tell Docker to read the Dockerfile from stdin, for example: `docker build -t attack-image -f - . <<'EOF' … EOF`. This small adjustment gives the daemon the required context and lets the inline Dockerfile be parsed correctly, eliminating the image‑building error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
