    "desc": "Apache JMeter versions 2.x and 3.x expose an RMI registry (default TCP port 1099) for the Distributed Test feature. The registry provides an unauthenticated reference to the JMeterEngine object. An attacker who can reach this RMI endpoint can send a crafted Java serialized payload, which is deserialized by the JMeter process. The deserialization triggers execution of attacker\u2011controlled code, granting remote code execution with the privileges of the JMeter process. The flaw exists in the RemoteWorker component and the JMeterEngine RMI communication and is fixed only in JMeter 4.0 and later.",
