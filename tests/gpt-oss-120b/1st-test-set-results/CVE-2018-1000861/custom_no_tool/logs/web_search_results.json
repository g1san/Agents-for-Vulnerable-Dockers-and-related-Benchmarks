    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111000861 is a critical vulnerability in the Jenkins core Stapler web framework. The Stapler MetaClass implementation allows an attacker to craft specially\u2011formed URLs that invoke arbitrary public getter or \\`do*\\` methods on Java objects reachable from the request. Because many Jenkins components expose methods following Java bean naming conventions, the attacker can trigger execution of unintended code paths, leading to unauthenticated remote code execution on the Jenkins master host. The flaw affects all Jenkins releases prior to the security patches released in 2018\u201112\u201105 (Jenkins 2.154 weekly and LTS 2.138.4 / 2.150.1). Exploits typically target the \\`/securityRealm/user/.../descriptorByName\\` endpoint, sending a Groovy script or malicious JAR that is evaluated and executed by the server, resulting in full system compromise.",
