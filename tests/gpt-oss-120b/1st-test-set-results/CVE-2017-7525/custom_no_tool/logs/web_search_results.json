    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20117525 is a vulnerability in the Jackson\u2011databind JSON processing library. The ObjectMapper deserialization routine trusts type information supplied in the JSON payload when default typing is enabled. An attacker can craft a JSON document containing a \"@class\" property that points to an arbitrary class on the classpath. Jackson will instantiate that class via reflection without proper validation, allowing execution of malicious code. The flaw results in unauthenticated remote code execution because any Java service that uses a vulnerable version of Jackson\u2011databind and processes external JSON input can be exploited simply by sending the malicious payload. The vulnerability affects all Jackson\u2011databind releases prior to 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1 and 2.8.9. Patching requires upgrading to a version at or beyond those thresholds or disabling default typing and configuring a whitelist of allowed types.",
