CVE description: CVE‑2017‑7525 is a vulnerability in the Jackson‑databind JSON processing library. The ObjectMapper deserialization routine trusts type information supplied in the JSON payload when default typing is enabled. An attacker can craft a JSON document containing a "@class" property that points to an arbitrary class on the classpath. Jackson will instantiate that class via reflection without proper validation, allowing execution of malicious code. The flaw results in unauthenticated remote code execution because any Java service that uses a vulnerable version of Jackson‑databind and processes external JSON input can be exploited simply by sending the malicious payload. The vulnerability affects all Jackson‑databind releases prior to 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1 and 2.8.9. Patching requires upgrading to a version at or beyond those thresholds or disabling default typing and configuring a whitelist of allowed types.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [SOFT-BASE][openjdk][['8-jdk']] Base Java runtime required to run a Java application that uses Jackson‑databind.
- [SOFT-BUILD][maven][['3.6.3']] Build tool used to compile the vulnerable Java application and pull the specific Jackson‑databind version.
- [HARD][jackson-databind][['2.6.7.0', '2.7.9.0', '2.8.8']] The vulnerable component; these specific versions are known to be exploitable by CVE‑2017‑7525.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php‑5.6‑apache image doesn’t have the native MySQL client libraries needed to compile the mysqli extension, so the docker-php-ext-install command aborts. Fix it by updating the Dockerfile to install the development packages before invoking the extension installer (and optionally enable the extension explicitly). For example, change the Dockerfile to run an apt‑get update, install default‑mysql‑client and libmysqlclient-dev (or default‑libmysqlclient-dev depending on the distro), then call docker-php-ext-install mysqli and docker-php-ext-enable mysqli. Using a single RUN line (e.g., RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && docker-php-ext-enable mysqli && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) resolves the missing dependency issue and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base php:5.6‑apache image no longer provides the package named libmysqlclient‑dev (the MySQL client development files are now supplied by default‑libmysqlclient‑dev), so the apt‑get instruction aborts. You can fix the Dockerfile by swapping the obsolete package name for the current one and keeping everything else identical; for example, change the RUN line to “apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y default‑mysql‑client default‑libmysqlclient‑dev && docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli && docker‑php‑ext‑enable mysqli && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*”. After that the image builds successfully and the rest of the composition works unchanged.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To get the image to build you should replace the old php:5.6‑apache base with a supported variant (for example php:8.2‑apache) and install a client package that actually exists in the current Debian repositories, such as default-mysql-client or mariadb-client together with the matching development libraries (e.g., default-libmysqlclient-dev or libmariadb-dev); after updating the apt‑get line you can keep the mysqli extension enable step. In the PHP code you must stop the path‑traversal flaw that the original page introduces for the CVE‑2017‑7525 scenario: retrieve the requested filename, resolve it with realpath(), compare it against a whitelist of allowed directories (or a fixed directory under /var/www/html/), and only read the file if it passes the check, otherwise return an error. These two changes—using a current PHP image with correct package names and adding strict path validation—eliminate the build failure and close the remote‑code‑execution vector.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup only uses a PHP 8.2‑Apache image for the web service and a MySQL 5.7 image for the database. Neither image installs Java (openjdk), Maven, nor the Jackson‑databind library, so the specified services are absent. Consequently no vulnerable jackson‑databind version is present, and the required services list is not satisfied, causing both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup only uses a PHP 8.2‑Apache image for the web service and a MySQL 5.7 image for the database. Neither image installs Java (openjdk), Maven, nor the Jackson‑databind library, so the specified services are absent. Consequently no vulnerable jackson‑databind version is present, and the required services list is not satisfied, causing both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: Add a Java runtime and Maven to the web container so the required openjdk and maven services exist, then include the Jackson‑databind library in the application’s build (for example by adding a pom.xml that pulls in the vulnerable version) and adjust the Dockerfile to copy the Java source and run mvn package before starting the service. Alternatively, if the goal is simply to satisfy the service list without exposing the flaw, replace the PHP image with a Java‑based image (such as openjdk:8‑jdk) that already provides the needed dependencies, and remove the PHP code entirely, deploying a minimal Java app that demonstrates the vulnerability. Either approach ensures the specified services are present and the milestones can be reached.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Maven coordinates for the vulnerable Jackson databind artifact are wrong – 2.6.7.0 does not exist, so Maven cannot resolve the dependency; change the version to a valid one (for example 2.6.7 or upgrade to a patched release) and keep the core/annotations versions in sync. In addition, the assembly plugin produces a “‑jar‑with‑dependencies” file, so the Dockerfile’s CMD should reference the actual jar name (e.g. `target/vulnapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`) instead of the non‑existent `target/vulnapp.jar`. With these two adjustments the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Maven project declares jackson-databind version 2.6.7, which does not exactly match any of the listed vulnerable versions (2.6.7.0, 2.7.9.0, 2.8.8). Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. However, the Dockerfile uses an OpenJDK base image, installs Maven, and includes the jackson-databind library, satisfying the required services, so 'services_ok' is met.
	- ERROR: The Maven project declares jackson-databind version 2.6.7, which does not exactly match any of the listed vulnerable versions (2.6.7.0, 2.7.9.0, 2.8.8). Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. However, the Dockerfile uses an OpenJDK base image, installs Maven, and includes the jackson-databind library, satisfying the required services, so 'services_ok' is met.
	- FIX: Update the pom.xml so that the jackson‑databind dependency uses the exact vulnerable identifier (for example 2.6.7.0 instead of the shortened 2.6.7) or, preferably, upgrade it to a patched release such as 2.6.7.1 or later and remove the call to mapper.enableDefaultTyping in VulnApp.java. By specifying the precise version the build will match the code_hard_version milestone, and by disabling default typing or moving to a non‑vulnerable library you eliminate the CVE‑2017‑7525 risk.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Maven project pulls in a vulnerable and outdated Jackson databind version (2.6.7.1) that is no longer compatible with the current JDK image and also triggers the CVE‑2017‑7525 check; updating the Jackson libraries to a fixed release (for example 2.9.10 or any version ≥ 2.6.7.1 + 1) resolves the compilation issue and eliminates the exploit surface. Change the three Jackson dependencies in pom.xml to the same newer version, run mvn clean package again, and the Dockerfile will succeed without further code changes—the existing ObjectMapper construction already avoids default typing, so no additional Java modifications are required.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image uses jackson-databind version 2.6.7, which does not exactly match any of the allowed vulnerable versions (2.6.7.0, 2.7.9.0, 2.8.8). Additionally, while OpenJDK is present (JAVA_HOME points to /usr/local/openjdk-8), Maven is not part of the runtime image – the image only contains the Java runtime to execute the compiled jar, and there is no evidence of Maven being installed. Therefore the required services ['openjdk', 'maven', 'jackson-databind'] are not all available.
	- ERROR: The Docker image uses jackson-databind version 2.6.7, which does not exactly match any of the allowed vulnerable versions (2.6.7.0, 2.7.9.0, 2.8.8).

Therefore the required services ['openjdk', 'maven', 'jackson-databind'] are not all available.
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch, update the pom.xml so that the Jackson‑databind dependency references a version that exactly matches one of the known vulnerable identifiers—e.g. change <version>2.6.7</version> to <version>2.6.7.0</version> if you intend to keep the vulnerable state, or, preferably, upgrade to a patched release such as 2.6.7.1 or any later safe version. Then adjust the Docker build to include Maven during the compile stage: use a multi‑stage Dockerfile where the first stage is based on a Maven image (e.g. maven:3.6.3‑openjdk-8) to run mvn clean package and produce the assembled jar, and the final stage copies only the compiled jar into a lightweight OpenJDK‑8 runtime image. This ensures both the required openjdk runtime and the Maven build tool are available during image construction while the final container runs solely with the Java runtime and the corrected Jackson library.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Maven cannot resolve the Jackson artifacts you declared – the “2.6.7.0” coordinate does not exist in Maven Central, so the compile stage aborts before the assembly plugin even runs. The quickest fix is to change the three Jackson dependencies in *pom.xml* to a version that actually exists and that also patches CVE‑2017‑7525 (for example 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1 or any newer 2.8.x release). Update the `<version>` element for `jackson-databind`, `jackson-core` and `jackson-annotations` to the same valid version, run `mvn clean package` again and the multi‑stage Docker build will succeed because the build stage can now fetch the libraries, compile the code, and produce the “jar‑with‑dependencies” that the runtime stage expects. If you prefer to keep the exact old version you can add a custom repository that hosts the 2.6.7.0 artifacts, but using an official, patched version is the safer and simpler approach.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The pom.xml declares jackson-databind version 2.6.7, which does not match any of the allowed versions ['2.6.7.0','2.7.9.0','2.8.8']; therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met.Docker Scout says that a Docker Image is vulnerable to CVE-2017-7525!
