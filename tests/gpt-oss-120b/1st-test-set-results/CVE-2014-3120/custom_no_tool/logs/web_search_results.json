    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20113120 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the open\u2011source search engine Elasticsearch. In versions prior to 1.2 the default configuration enables dynamic scripting (MVEL, Groovy, etc.). An attacker who can reach the Elasticsearch HTTP API (default port 9200) can submit a crafted _search request containing a \"source\" or \"script\" field with malicious code. The server evaluates the script with the privileges of the Elasticsearch process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, read or write arbitrary files, and ultimately compromise the host system. No authentication is required in the default setup, making the flaw exploitable over the network without any user interaction.",
