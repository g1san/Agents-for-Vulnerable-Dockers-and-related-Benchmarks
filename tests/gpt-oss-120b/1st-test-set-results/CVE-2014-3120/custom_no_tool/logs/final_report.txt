CVE description: CVE‑2014‑3120 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the open‑source search engine Elasticsearch. In versions prior to 1.2 the default configuration enables dynamic scripting (MVEL, Groovy, etc.). An attacker who can reach the Elasticsearch HTTP API (default port 9200) can submit a crafted _search request containing a "source" or "script" field with malicious code. The server evaluates the script with the privileges of the Elasticsearch process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, read or write arbitrary files, and ultimately compromise the host system. No authentication is required in the default setup, making the flaw exploitable over the network without any user interaction.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][elasticsearch][['1.0.0', '1.0.1', '1.0.2', '1.0.3', '1.0.4', '1.0.5', '1.0.6', '1.1.0', '1.1.1', '1.1.2', '1.2.0']] Elasticsearch container provides the vulnerable service; the dynamic scripting feature in these versions allows execution of attacker‑supplied code via the REST search API.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Struts‑2 archive is being unpacked into a temporary folder that does not contain the expected “src” layout, so the subsequent `cp -r /tmp/struts/struts-2.3.15.1/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/` command cannot find the files to copy. Change the Dockerfile to unzip directly into the web‑app directory (or copy the specific “webapp” sub‑folder that contains the compiled JSPs and classes) and add a cleanup of the apt cache; for example, replace the unzip line with `unzip /tmp/struts2.zip -d /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT && rm -rf /tmp/struts2.zip` and ensure the base image uses a compatible JDK (Tomcat 7‑jdk8 works reliably). This eliminates the missing‑file error and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to unzip the Struts archive straight into `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` before that directory actually exists, and the base Tomcat image does not create a `ROOT` folder by default. To fix it, add a `mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` (or simply unzip into `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps` and let Tomcat create the `ROOT` folder) right after installing the tools, and then unzip the archive into the newly‑created path. Keeping the package installation line unchanged ensures `wget` and `unzip` are present, so the corrected Dockerfile fragment looks like:

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip && \
    mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT && \
    wget -O /tmp/struts2.zip https://archive.apache.org/dist/struts/struts-2.3.15.1/struts-2.3.15.1-all.zip && \
    unzip /tmp/struts2.zip -d /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT && \
    rm -f /tmp/struts2.zip && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

After adding the `mkdir` (or targeting `webapps` instead of `webapps/ROOT`), the image builds successfully and the container will start without the previous termination error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to unzip the Struts 2 all‑in‑one archive straight into Tomcat’s ROOT directory, but the archive’s internal layout doesn’t match a deployable webapp and Tomcat ends up with a malformed directory structure; to fix it, first unzip the archive to a temporary location, then move only the `webapp` folder (or the `WEB-INF` hierarchy) into `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT`, and finally clean up the temporary files. Adjust the Dockerfile so the `RUN` line reads something like: 

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip && \
    mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT && \
    wget -O /tmp/struts2.zip https://archive.apache.org/dist/struts/struts-2.3.15.1/struts-2.3.15.1-all.zip && \
    unzip /tmp/struts2.zip -d /tmp && \
    cp -r /tmp/struts-2.3.15.1-all/webapp/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/ && \
    rm -rf /tmp/struts2.zip /tmp/struts-2.3.15.1-all && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
``` 

This ensures only the valid web application files are placed in ROOT, preventing the directory‑structure error and allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the clean‑up command tries to delete a non‑existent path – the wildcard is attached to the directory name (`/var/lib/apt/lists*`) instead of the directory’s contents, which makes `rm` exit with an error and abort the image creation. Change the last part of the `RUN` line to delete the files inside the `lists` directory, for example:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget unzip && \
    mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT && \
    wget -O /tmp/struts2.zip https://archive.apache.org/dist/struts/struts-2.3.15.1/struts-2.3.15.1-all.zip && \
    unzip /tmp/struts2.zip -d /tmp && \
    cp -r /tmp/struts-2.3.15.1-all/webapp/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/ && \
    rm -rf /tmp/struts2.zip /tmp/struts-2.3.15.1-all && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Once the cleanup line uses `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` (or simply omits it, since `apt-get clean` already removes the cache), the image builds successfully. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the old Debian repositories in the tomcat:7‑jdk8 image are no longer reachable with a normal apt‑get update; the archive URLs are added but the validity check still aborts, and the subsequent wget of the Struts zip over HTTPS can also be rejected by the outdated OpenSSL libraries. To repair it, edit the Dockerfile so the update command explicitly disables the “valid‑until” check (e.g. `apt-get -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false update`) and make sure the configuration file that disables the check is written **before** the update runs. Then change the Struts download URL to plain http instead of https (which works with the old TLS stack). After these two tweaks the RUN line will complete, the zip will be fetched and unpacked, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile only downloads and extracts the Struts 2 demo archive but never copies the local WEB‑INF configuration (web.xml, struts‑config.xml, Action.java, JSP, etc.) into the Tomcat webapp, so the later `docker-compose up` tries to start a container that has no valid application and the Tomcat start‑up aborts. The fix is to add a `COPY` (or `ADD`) instruction after the unzip step that copies the contents of the `web/WEB-INF` directory from the build context into `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF` (creating the directory first if needed). For example, after the `rm -rf /tmp/...` line insert:

```
mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/com/example
COPY web/WEB-INF/ /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/
```

This ensures the Struts2 configuration and Java classes are present when Tomcat starts, eliminating the build‑time error. Optionally you can drop the external Struts zip download if you only need the minimal app, which also shortens the build and avoids version mismatches.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile is using the wrong copy source – when the compose file sets the build context to ./web the line COPY web/ looks for a sub‑directory named web inside that context, which does not exist, and the Java source files are never compiled into class files for Tomcat to load. Change the compose service to use the repository root as the build context (e.g. build: . or point to a dedicated folder that contains both the Dockerfile and the web directory) and edit the Dockerfile so the copy line reads COPY web/ /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/ or, if the context is already the root, simply COPY . /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/. Then add a compilation step before the copy, for example installing openjdk‑8‑jdk and running javac -d web/WEB-INF/classes $(find web/ -name "*.java") so the Action.class ends up in WEB-INF/classes. With the correct context, proper copy path, and compiled classes the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to compile raw Java sources in‑place without pulling in the Struts2 libraries that the application depends on, so the `javac` step aborts with “cannot find symbol” errors. The quick fix is to replace the manual compilation with a Maven build that resolves all required dependencies, then copy the resulting WAR into Tomcat’s `webapps/ROOT`. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to use a Maven image (or install Maven on the Tomcat base), run `mvn package` inside the source tree, and finally `COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war`; you can also drop the unnecessary `apt‑get install openjdk-8-jdk` line because the `tomcat:7-jdk8` base already provides a JDK. This eliminates the compile‑time classpath errors and lets the image finish building successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build itself is fine – the problem shows up when the Tomcat image tries to start because Struts 2 can’t find its configuration file. In Struts 2 the framework looks for **struts.xml** on the classpath, not for a file called *struts‑config.xml*. Rename `WEB-INF/classes/struts-config.xml` to `WEB-INF/classes/struts.xml` (or copy it under that name) and keep the same XML contents; Tomcat will then load the Struts configuration correctly and the container will start without error. After that the `docker‑compose up` command will complete successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
