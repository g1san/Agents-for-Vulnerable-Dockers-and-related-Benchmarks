    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201143441 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph\u2011Server. The affected component is the HugeGraph\u2011Server graph\u2011database server, which authenticates clients using JWT tokens. Versions from the initial 1.0.0 release up to, but not including, 1.5.0 treat certain data as immutable and trust it for authentication decisions. An attacker can supply or manipulate this data, causing the server to accept forged credentials and bypass authentication entirely. This enables unauthenticated remote actors to gain full access to the HugeGraph APIs, allowing them to read, modify, or delete graph data and change server configuration. The vulnerability is network\u2011remote, requires no user interaction, and has a CVSS\u202f3.1 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical level of severity. Exploitation has been observed in the wild. The issue is resolved by upgrading to Apache HugeGraph\u2011Server version 1.5.0 or later, which implements proper immutable\u2011secret handling and enforces correct authentication checks.",
