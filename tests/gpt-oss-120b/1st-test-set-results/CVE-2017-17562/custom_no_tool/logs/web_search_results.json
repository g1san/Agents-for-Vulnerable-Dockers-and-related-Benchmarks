{
    "desc": "CVE-2017-17562 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the GoAhead HTTP server. When the CGI feature is enabled and CGI programs are compiled as dynamically\u2011linked binaries, the server builds the environment for the forked CGI script directly from HTTP request parameters without sanitising them. This allows an attacker to inject dangerous environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD. By sending a crafted HTTP request to a CGI endpoint that includes a malicious shared\u2011object payload and setting LD_PRELOAD to point to the payload (for example via /proc/self/fd/0), the dynamic linker loads and executes the attacker\u2011controlled code. The exploit works without authentication on any GoAhead deployment that runs versions earlier than 3.6.5 and has CGI enabled, granting the attacker execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the CGI process.",
