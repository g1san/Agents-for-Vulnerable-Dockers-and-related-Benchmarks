CVE description: CVE-2017-17562 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the GoAhead HTTP server. When the CGI feature is enabled and CGI programs are compiled as dynamically‑linked binaries, the server builds the environment for the forked CGI script directly from HTTP request parameters without sanitising them. This allows an attacker to inject dangerous environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD. By sending a crafted HTTP request to a CGI endpoint that includes a malicious shared‑object payload and setting LD_PRELOAD to point to the payload (for example via /proc/self/fd/0), the dynamic linker loads and executes the attacker‑controlled code. The exploit works without authentication on any GoAhead deployment that runs versions earlier than 3.6.5 and has CGI enabled, granting the attacker execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the CGI process.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution via environment variable injection

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running (State.Running = true) but Solr failed to start the 'vulnerable' core. The logs contain an ERROR indicating "Could not load conf for core vulnerable: Can't load schema ... Unknown fieldType 'string' specified on field id" and subsequent stack traces. This core initialization failure means the service is not operating correctly, so the container is not OK.
	- ERROR: The container is running (State.Running = true) but Solr failed to start the 'vulnerable' core. The logs contain an ERROR indicating "Could not load conf for core vulnerable: Can't load schema ... Unknown fieldType 'string' specified on field id" and subsequent stack traces. This core initialization failure means the service is not operating correctly, so the container is not OK.
	- FIX: Fix the core by adding the missing field‑type definitions to the schema used for the “vulnerable” core. In schema.xml, before the <field> entries, insert a <fieldType> block that defines the “string” type (for example <fieldType name="string" class="solr.StrField" sortMissingLast="true" />) and any other default types that Solr 5.5.5 expects (text_general, etc.). Alternatively replace the custom schema.xml with the standard managed-schema that ships with the Solr distribution, or change the <schemaFactory> line to use ClassicIndexSchemaFactory so the built‑in field types are available. Once the schema includes a valid definition for “string”, Solr will load the core successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration uses the solr:5.5.5 image and does not include any of the required services ('goahead/goahead' or 'alpine'). Consequently, it cannot be using a vulnerable version of the 'goahead' service, and it also fails to satisfy the 'services_ok' milestone because the expected services are missing.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration uses the solr:5.5.5 image and does not include any of the required services ('goahead/goahead' or 'alpine'). Consequently, it cannot be using a vulnerable version of the 'goahead' service, and it also fails to satisfy the 'services_ok' milestone because the expected services are missing.
	- FIX: Add a second service definition to the compose file that runs the vulnerable GoAhead image (for example goahead/goahead:3.5) on an Alpine‑based host, and expose its HTTP port; then configure the solr service to depend on that service so Docker starts both containers. Update the volumes section of the GoAhead service to mount the same templates directory (or any required CGI binaries) so the exploit code is reachable, and optionally add a healthcheck to verify the GoAhead process is running. With the GoAhead container present the stack now satisfies the required goahead/goahead and alpine dependencies and the services_ok milestone.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Docker can’t mount the host paths you’ve declared – the directories referenced in the volumes sections either don’t exist or are pointing at the wrong location relative to the compose file, so the container start‑up aborts. Create the missing solr/configsets/vulnerable/templates directory (or move the existing templates folder there), then update the goahead service’s volume line to use the correct absolute or relative path (for example `- ./solr/configsets/vulnerable/templates:/var/www/cgi-bin` if the compose file lives in the root of dockers/CVE-2017-17562/custom_no_tool). Also make sure the Solr configsets directory is present at `./solr/configsets` so the solr service can bind‑mount it; if it’s missing, add an empty configsets folder or copy the required files into it. After the host directories exist and the volume mappings correctly point to them, Docker will be able to build and start the containers without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the GoAhead source archive isn’t being downloaded correctly – the URL you’re using returns an HTML download‑page rather than the .tar.gz file, so the subsequent `tar xzf` step can’t extract anything and the `make` step never finds a source tree. Fix it by changing the `wget` line to follow redirects (or by using the direct “downloads” endpoint) and by installing the minimal build‑time packages required for compilation. In practice you can replace the download command with something like:

```dockerfile
RUN wget -qO- "https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/goahead/goahead-3.5.tar.gz" | tar xz --strip-components=1
```

or, if you prefer a separate step,

```dockerfile
RUN wget -L -O goahead-3.5.tar.gz "https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/goahead/goahead-3.5.tar.gz" && \
    tar xzf goahead-3.5.tar.gz --strip-components=1 && \
    rm goahead-3.5.tar.gz
```

Make sure the `apk add` line includes the compilers (`gcc`, `musl-dev`, `make`) and any runtime libraries (`libc6-compat` if needed). After the source is correctly extracted, the `make && chmod +x goahead` line will succeed and the image will build without error. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based image is missing a few libraries that GoAhead 3.5 expects when compiling with CGI support – in particular the standard C library development files and the GNU compatibility linker that provides LD_PRELOAD handling. To fix it, add the missing packages (e.g. libc6-compat and libgcc) to the apk install line, and make sure the build runs in a clean directory after the source is extracted (move the chmod into the same RUN step that builds). For example, change the first RUN to `apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev make wget ca-certificates libc6-compat libgcc` and combine the make and chmod commands into a single RUN so the image compiles successfully. Once those dependencies are present, the Docker build completes and the container starts as expected.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image used for compilation is missing a few libraries that GoAhead’s makefile expects (the package name `libc6-compat` no longer exists in Alpine 3.20 and the binary also needs the standard C runtime libraries that the plain musl toolchain does not provide). The quick fix is to replace the current “apk add” line with one that pulls in the full build‑essential set and the glibc compatibility layer, then clean up the image afterward. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to install `build-base` (which brings in gcc, make, musl‑dev and the usual C libs) and the `glibc` package from the community repository (or use the `alpine-pkg-glibc` script), drop the obsolete `libc6-compat` entry, and keep the rest of the steps unchanged. After the compile finishes you can switch to a slimmer runtime stage that only copies the compiled `goahead` binary and the configuration file, keeping the final image small while providing the libraries the binary needs to start. This adjustment resolves the missing‑package error and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine builder is missing the libraries that GoAhead’s makefile expects, so the compilation step aborts. Add the development packages for the libraries it links against (for example pcre‑dev, openssl‑dev, zlib‑dev and linux‑headers) to the first apk install line, then run make again; the binary will be produced and can be copied into the runtime stage. Also make sure the COPY for the configuration file points at the correct location (the file lives next to the Dockerfile, so COPY goahead.conf /etc/goahead.conf is fine) and that the runtime stage’s CMD matches the installed binary path (‑c /etc/goahead.conf). After installing those missing deps the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the runtime image does not contain the shared libraries that the dynamically linked GoAhead binary needs (PCRE, OpenSSL and zlib), and the final stage also does not install the CGI directory expected by the configuration. To fix it, add the runtime packages in the second stage (e.g. `apk add --no-cache pcre openssl zlib`) and make sure the compiled binary is placed in a directory that is in the PATH (the current copy to `/usr/local/bin` is fine). Also verify that `goahead.conf` references the CGI path you mount (e.g. `/var/www/cgi-bin`) and that the file exists in the build context. After adding the shared‑library packages to the final image the build should finish successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the tar command strips the top‑level directory from the GoAhead source tree, leaving the Makefile one level deeper than `/src` where the subsequent `make` is run, so `make` can’t find its target. Change the Dockerfile to extract the archive without `--strip‑components=1` (or add a `WORKDIR` step that cd’s into the extracted folder) and then run `make`. For example, replace the download line with:

```
RUN wget -qO- "https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/goahead/goahead-3.5.tar.gz" | \
    tar xz && \
    cd goahead-3.5 && \
    make && \
    chmod +x goahead
```

and copy the binary from that sub‑directory (`/src/goahead-3.5/goahead`) into the runtime image. This aligns the build context with the actual source layout and eliminates the “No rule to make target” error.
