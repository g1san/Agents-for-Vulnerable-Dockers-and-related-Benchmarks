CVE description: Apache CouchDB versions prior to the security patches allow an attacker who obtains administrative privileges to modify the server configuration via the HTTP(S) API. Certain configuration keys accept filesystem paths to binaries that CouchDB later executes on startup or when the configuration is changed. By setting these keys to point to attacker‑controlled executables, arbitrary commands can be run as the CouchDB operating‑system user, resulting in remote code execution. The issue is present in all CouchDB releases before 1.7.0 and in the 2.x series before 2.1.1. No additional services are required for the exploitation; the vulnerability resides entirely within the core CouchDB service.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the exploit client container tries to run Docker commands (docker build, docker push) but the image only contains curl and never installs the Docker client nor has access to the host Docker daemon; to fix it you should install the Docker CLI (for example by adding RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli to Dockerfile.client) and bind‑mount the Docker socket into the container (add volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock under the client service in docker‑compose.yml) so the commands can talk to the daemon, and optionally give the container a user with permission to access the socket. After adding the CLI and the socket mount the populate.sh script will be able to build and push the test image without error.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the client container can’t run the Docker CLI – the Alpine package name used in the Dockerfile is wrong and the container isn’t privileged enough to talk to the host daemon through the mounted socket. Change the client Dockerfile to install the correct package (e.g. `apk add --no-cache curl docker`) and make sure the service runs as root (the default) or add `privileged: true` in the compose definition for the client. Those two tweaks let the `docker` command inside the container find the binary and connect to `/var/run/docker.sock`, so the image builds and the script can push the test image without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the client container never makes the populate.sh script executable, so when Docker tries to run it the container exits with “permission denied”. Adding a chmod step in the Dockerfile (or marking the file executable in the source tree) fixes the problem; for example, after copying the script run RUN chmod +x /populate.sh and then keep the CMD as‑is. With the script marked as executable the client container can start, build the temporary image, push it to the local registry and proceed to the exploitation step.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build itself isn’t broken – the failure happens when the **client** container runs `populate.sh`. Inside the container `localhost` refers to the container itself, so the Docker commands try to push to a registry that isn’t listening on that address and the script aborts, causing Docker‑Compose to think the service failed to start. Change the script to address the registry from the client’s network namespace (for example, use the special DNS name `host.docker.internal` or the explicit service name `registry` defined in the compose file) and the image will build and run without error. In other words, replace every occurrence of `localhost:5000` in `populate.sh` with `registry:5000` (or `host.docker.internal:5000`), rebuild and the composition will complete successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because populate.sh creates Dockerfile.tmp in the container’s root filesystem and then runs docker build with “.” as the build context, which makes Docker try to ship the entire root directory into the build and quickly runs out of resources or hits permission errors. To fix it, have the script create a temporary work directory (for example /tmp/build ), write Dockerfile.tmp there, change into that directory, and invoke docker build with that directory as the context (e.g. docker build -t registry:5000/testimage:latest .). After the image is built you can push it and then delete the temporary directory. This isolates the build context to only the files you need and eliminates the error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based client image installs the wrong package – the “docker” package pulls in the daemon, not the thin client needed to talk to the host daemon through the mounted socket – so the “docker” binary isn’t available when the script runs. Change the Dockerfile.client line `RUN apk add --no‑cache curl docker` to install the client instead (e.g. `RUN apk add --no‑cache curl docker-cli`) and, if you want to be explicit, reference the binary as `/usr/bin/docker` in populate.sh. After rebuilding the client image with this adjustment the script can reach the host Docker socket, build the test image, push it to the vulnerable registry, and the compose stack will start without the previous error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the client image is trying to run the Docker CLI but the Alpine package name you used (`docker-cli`) does not actually install the `docker` binary in the location the script expects, which makes the `docker` commands in `populate.sh` unavailable during the container start‑up. Fix it by switching the package install line to pull the proper Docker client package (for Alpine 3.14 the package is simply `docker`) and then reference the binary as just `docker` (or `/usr/bin/docker` if you prefer). After that change the `COPY` line stays the same and the script will be able to invoke `docker build` and `docker push` without error, letting the compose stack start normally.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the client container tries to push an image to the local registry over plain HTTP, but the Docker daemon it contacts (via the mounted socket) does not allow insecure registries by default, so the push is rejected and the script aborts. To fix this, configure the host Docker daemon (or the Docker daemon the client talks to) to treat registry:5000 as an insecure registry—add an "insecure-registries": ["registry:5000"] entry to /etc/docker/daemon.json and restart the daemon—and optionally set DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock in the client container so the CLI uses the mounted socket. With the daemon accepting the insecure endpoint the script can build, tag, and push the test image without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The client container is likely trying to push the image before the registry is fully ready, which causes the build‑and‑push step to fail and makes the whole service appear broken; add a short wait loop (for example, curl the /v2/_catalog endpoint in a retry loop) before running the docker build and docker push commands, and make sure the URL includes the protocol (use http://registry:5000 instead of just registry:5000) so the Docker client can contact the registry; also give the client a working directory (e.g. WORKDIR /opt) before copying the script so the script is written where it will be executed, and the container will start correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
