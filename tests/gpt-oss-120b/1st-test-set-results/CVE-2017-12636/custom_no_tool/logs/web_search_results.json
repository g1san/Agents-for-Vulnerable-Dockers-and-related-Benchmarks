    "desc": "Apache CouchDB versions prior to the security patches allow an attacker who obtains administrative privileges to modify the server configuration via the HTTP(S) API. Certain configuration keys accept filesystem paths to binaries that CouchDB later executes on startup or when the configuration is changed. By setting these keys to point to attacker\u2011controlled executables, arbitrary commands can be run as the CouchDB operating\u2011system user, resulting in remote code execution. The issue is present in all CouchDB releases before 1.7.0 and in the 2.x series before 2.1.1. No additional services are required for the exploitation; the vulnerability resides entirely within the core CouchDB service.",
