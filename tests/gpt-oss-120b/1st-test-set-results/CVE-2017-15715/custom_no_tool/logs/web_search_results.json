    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201115715 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.29. The flaw resides in the regular\u2011expression engine used by the <FilesMatch> directive. When the end\u2011of\u2011string anchor ($) is evaluated, the engine incorrectly treats a newline character inside a filename as matching the end of the string. An attacker can therefore craft a filename that contains a newline (for example, \"evil.php\\n\") and cause a <FilesMatch> pattern such as \"\\.php$\" to believe the filename ends before the newline. This bypasses filename\u2011based upload restrictions that rely on <FilesMatch> to block certain file types. The bypass enables an attacker to upload files that would otherwise be denied, potentially allowing the storage and later execution of malicious scripts on the web server, leading to unauthorized code execution or other malicious impact depending on the surrounding application logic.",
