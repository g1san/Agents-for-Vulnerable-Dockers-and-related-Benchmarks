    "desc": "Apache Dubbo versions 2.5.x (all releases), 2.6.0 through 2.6.7, and 2.7.0 through 2.7.4.1 contain a vulnerable HTTP protocol handler. When the Dubbo provider is configured with the \\\"http\\\" protocol, the server reads the request body and deserializes it using Java native serialization without any validation. An attacker can send a crafted Java\u2011serialized payload (for example a Commons\u2011Collections4 gadget generated with ysoserial) via a POST request to the Dubbo HTTP endpoint. The unsafe deserialization is performed in `RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter.readObject`, leading to execution of arbitrary code on the provider JVM. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication and results in full remote code execution on the compromised host. The issue is fixed in Dubbo 2.7.5 and later, or by disabling the HTTP protocol entirely.",
