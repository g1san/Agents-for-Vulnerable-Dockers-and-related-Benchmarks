CVE description: Apache Dubbo versions 2.5.x (all releases), 2.6.0 through 2.6.7, and 2.7.0 through 2.7.4.1 contain a vulnerable HTTP protocol handler. When the Dubbo provider is configured with the \"http\" protocol, the server reads the request body and deserializes it using Java native serialization without any validation. An attacker can send a crafted Java‑serialized payload (for example a Commons‑Collections4 gadget generated with ysoserial) via a POST request to the Dubbo HTTP endpoint. The unsafe deserialization is performed in `RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter.readObject`, leading to execution of arbitrary code on the provider JVM. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication and results in full remote code execution on the compromised host. The issue is fixed in Dubbo 2.7.5 and later, or by disabling the HTTP protocol entirely.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition only includes a PHP 5.6‑apache web container and a MySQL 5.7 database. Neither apache/dubbo nor zookeeper are present, so the required services are not used. Consequently, there is no instance of apache/dubbo with a version from the specified list, causing both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition only includes a PHP 5.6‑apache web container and a MySQL 5.7 database. Neither apache/dubbo nor zookeeper are present, so the required services are not used. Consequently, there is no instance of apache/dubbo with a version from the specified list, causing both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: Add a third service to the compose file that runs an Apache Dubbo server (or a compatible Java image) at a version that contains the vulnerable HTTP handler, such as 2.7.4, and include the Zookeeper container version 3.7.0 on the same network so Dubbo can register its services. Then adjust the web container to depend on the new “dubbo” service (or expose the Dubbo HTTP endpoint) and configure Dubbo to use the “http” protocol in its configuration files; this satisfies the required service dependencies and lets the test environment contain the targeted Dubbo and Zookeeper instances. After adding those services the milestones will detect the presence of apache/dubbo and zookeeper as specified.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php‑5.6‑apache image does not have the system libraries required to compile the mysqli extension, so the docker‑php‑ext‑install step aborts; to fix it you should update the package index and install the MySQL client development files before invoking the extension installer, for example by adding a line such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libmariadb-dev-compat && docker-php-ext-install mysqli` in the Dockerfile (or by merging those commands into a single RUN statement), which provides the necessary headers and libraries and allows the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP‑5.6‑Apache image you start from doesn’t contain the “libmariadb-dev-compat” package name used for the MySQL client libraries on newer Debian releases, so the apt install step aborts. To fix it, change the base image to a newer variant that still provides PHP 5.6 (for example `php:5.6-apache-buster` or `php:5.6-apache-stretch`) and replace the problematic package with one that exists in that distribution, such as `default-mysql-client` together with `default-libmysqlclient-dev` (or simply `libmysqlclient-dev`). Then run `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` as before. After updating the Dockerfile with the compatible base tag and correct package names, the image builds successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the two Dockerfiles are trying to install packages that either don’t exist in the chosen base images or need extra support files, so the apt‑get step aborts. In the PHP image you should replace `libmysqlclient-dev` with the package name that actually exists for the Buster‑based 5.6 image (for example `default-libmysqlclient-dev`) and add any missing utilities such as `ca-certificates` so that the later `wget` in the Dubbo image can validate TLS. Likewise, in the Dubbo image install `ca-certificates` before running `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y wget tar` to avoid SSL errors when downloading the archive. After those adjustments the images build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dubbo Dockerfile tries to start the server with a script that isn’t executable after extraction, and the tarball name used in the URL does not match the actual file name for version 2.7.4 (the archive is called apache‑dubbo‑2.7.4‑bin.tar.gz, not apache‑dubbo‑${DUBBO_VERSION}‑bin.tar.gz). To fix it, change the `ENV DUBBO_VERSION=2.7.4` line to use the exact version string that matches the archive, add a `chmod +x ./bin/startup.sh` before the `CMD`, and simplify the `CMD` to `["./bin/startup.sh"]` so Docker runs the script directly. After these edits the image should build without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dubbo Dockerfile tries to download a tarball that does not exist for the exact version you set (2.7.4) and the startup script is not being invoked correctly; simply change the version to one that is available (for example 2.7.5 or 2.7.4.1) and adjust the download URL accordingly, then after extracting move the directory to /opt/dubbo, give bin/startup.sh execute permission and invoke it with a proper shell command – e.g. set WORKDIR /opt/dubbo and replace the CMD line with ["sh","-c","./bin/startup.sh"] so the container can start without error. This small change resolves the missing‑file issue and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dubbo image never makes the startup script runnable in the context where it’s executed. After extracting the archive the script lives in `/opt/dubbo/bin/startup.sh`, but the Dockerfile only gives execute permission to the file name with a leading `./` that is resolved only at runtime, and the default `sh -c` wrapper adds an extra layer that can’t find the script if the working directory isn’t exactly as expected. Fix it by granting execute rights to everything under `bin` right after the extract, then invoke the script directly without the extra `sh -c`. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to run `chmod +x /opt/dubbo/bin/*.sh` (or `chmod -R +x bin`) and replace the last line with `CMD ["/opt/dubbo/bin/startup.sh"]`. This ensures the script is executable and the container can start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dubbo image never makes the startup script executable in a way the container can run it, and the working directory is set before the script file actually exists. To fix it, change the Dubbo Dockerfile so that the extraction, permission change and entry‑point are performed after the archive is unpacked and the script is guaranteed to be present, and invoke the script with an explicit interpreter. For example, after the `tar -xzf …` line add a `chmod +x /opt/dubbo/bin/startup.sh && ln -s /opt/dubbo/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/dubbo-start`, then set `WORKDIR /opt/dubbo` and replace the `CMD` line with `CMD ["sh","/opt/dubbo/bin/startup.sh"]`. This ensures the script can be executed and the container starts correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dubbo image tries to start a script that isn’t where the container expects it after the archive is unpacked. Change the CMD to run the script from the working directory (or verify the path after extraction) and make sure the script is actually present before you mark it executable. In practice you can keep the `WORKDIR /opt/dubbo` line, confirm the archive expands to a `bin/startup.sh` file, then replace  

```dockerfile
CMD ["sh","/opt/dubbo/bin/startup.sh"]
```  

with  

```dockerfile
CMD ["sh","./bin/startup.sh"]
```  

or simply  

```dockerfile
CMD ["./bin/startup.sh"]
```  

so the container looks for the script relative to `/opt/dubbo`. After that adjustment the image should build without error. (If you still hit a missing‑file problem, double‑check the download URL and the extracted directory name, updating the `mv` command accordingly.)
