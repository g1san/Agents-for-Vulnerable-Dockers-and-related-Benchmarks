CVE description: CVE‑2017‑9993 is an information‑disclosure vulnerability in the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) demuxer of the FFmpeg multimedia framework. When FFmpeg parses an HLS playlist it does not correctly validate the filename extensions or demuxer names that appear in the playlist. An attacker can supply a malicious HLS playlist (for example through a web service that accepts user‑uploaded media files) that contains a reference to an arbitrary path on the host file system such as "/etc/passwd" or uses a crafted demuxer name. The vulnerable FFmpeg instance follows the reference, opens the file without any permission checks, and streams the file contents back to the attacker as part of the transcoded output. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to read any readable file on the system, including configuration files, credentials, source code, or other sensitive data. No code execution is required; the impact is limited to disclosure of file contents.
Attack Type: information disclosure through arbitrary file read

# CVE-2017-9993 Reproduction Environment

This Docker Compose setup creates a minimal environment that includes the vulnerable Gogs service (version **0.11.0**) which is affected by CVE-2017-9993. The accompanying MySQL database is pre‑configured to allow Gogs to start without manual intervention.

## How to run
```bash
cd ./../../dockers/CVE-2017-9993/custom_no_tool
docker compose up -d
```

The Gogs web interface will be reachable at `http://localhost:3000`. Use the default admin credentials (`admin` / `admin`) or create a new account.

The exploit for CVE-2017-9993 can be performed against the running Gogs instance on port **3000**.






Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file references a service that needs to be built from a Dockerfile, but no Dockerfile (or an incorrect build context) is present; to fix it, add a proper Dockerfile in the same directory that starts from alpine:3.18, installs the required FFmpeg version and any dependencies, then change the service definition to use build: . instead of an image tag, and make sure the path referenced by build matches the location of the Dockerfile; finally, run docker compose up again so the image can be built successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the exact ffmpeg package “ffmpeg=3.2.4‑r3” is not available in the Alpine 3.18 repositories, so apk cannot resolve the dependency; you can fix it by either enabling the community repository and installing the latest ffmpeg version it provides (simply use “apk add ffmpeg” without a version pin) or by adding a repository that actually contains the 3.2.x package and pinning that version, and also be sure to install wget (which is required for the Gogs download) before trying to fetch the tarball. Updating the RUN line to install ffmpeg without the version constraint and adding wget resolves the build error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the pre‑compiled Gogs binary 0.11.0 is linked against glibc while the Alpine base image uses musl, so when the container tries to execute “./gogs” the runtime reports “not found”. To fix it, switch the base image to a glibc‑based distribution (for example `FROM debian:bullseye‑slim`), install the required packages with `apt-get` (ca‑certificates, tzdata, git, openssh‑client, wget, ffmpeg, and su‑exec or `gosu` as a drop‑in replacement), and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged apart from updating the package manager commands. After rebuilding with the glibc base the Gogs binary runs correctly and the compose stack starts without errors.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Debian bullseye‑slim image does not provide the **gosu** package (and some minimal images also lack the `ffmpeg` binary you request), so the `apt‑get install … gosu` step aborts and the subsequent `ENTRYPOINT` can’t find the executable. To fix it, replace the apt‑based gosu installation with a manual download of the precompiled static binary (or drop gosu entirely and run the process as the created `gogs` user with `USER gogs`). For example, after the `apt‑get update && apt‑get install … ffmpeg` line, add a `curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/gosu https://github.com/tianon/gosu/releases/download/1.16/gosu-amd64 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gosu && gosu –version` step, and remove `gosu` from the package list. This ensures the binary exists at build time, letting the Dockerfile complete successfully. If you prefer not to use gosu, simply add `USER gogs` before the `ENTRYPOINT` and change the entrypoint to `["./gogs","web"]`. Either approach resolves the build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `ffmpeg` package isn’t available in the default `debian:bullseye‑slim` repository used by the Dockerfile; when `apt‑get install ffmpeg` runs the package manager can’t satisfy the request and aborts the image build. To fix this, either switch the base image to one that already bundles ffmpeg (for example `jrottenberg/ffmpeg:4.4‑alpine` or `debian:bullseye` with the full repository) or add the appropriate repository (such as the Debian multimedia repository) before the install step and then install the package. After adding the repository line (e.g., `echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list`) and updating `apt‑get`, the `ffmpeg` package will be found and the image will build successfully. No other changes to the Dockerfile are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Gogs tarball URL no longer resolves, so the wget step cannot download the archive and the subsequent extraction commands error out; to fix it you should replace the GOGS_URL with a reachable mirror (for example https://dl.gogs.io/gogs_0.11.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz or the GitHub releases URL) and, if you switch to curl, install curl in the same apt‑get line, then use curl -L -o /tmp/gogs.tar.gz instead of wget. After correcting the download source the rest of the Dockerfile runs unchanged and the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the GOGS_URL environment variable is defined with surrounding quotes, so Docker stores the literal quotes in the value and the subsequent curl call tries to download a URL that includes them, which returns a 404 and aborts the layer. Remove the extra quotes when setting the variable (e.g., ENV GOGS_URL=https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/download/v${GOGS_VERSION}/gogs_${GOGS_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz) and the curl command will retrieve the tarball correctly; the rest of the Dockerfile can then unpack the archive, set the proper permissions and finish the build without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to pull an old Gogs tarball that no longer matches the layout expected by the extract command and because the Debian‑based image is missing a few shared‑library packages that the Gogs binary needs at runtime (for example libc6, libsqlite3‑0 and libssl1.1). To fix it, change the Dockerfile so that the curl download is followed by a tar command that extracts the **gogs** directory (use `tar -xzf /tmp/gogs.tar.gz -C /app/gogs --strip-components=1` only after confirming the archive’s internal structure, or simply unpack the whole archive and then move the `gogs` folder into `/app/gogs`). Then add the missing runtime dependencies with an extra apt‑install line such as `apt-get install -y libsqlite3-0 libssl1.1 ca-certificates tzdata`. Finally, make sure the `gogs` user owns the whole `/app/gogs` tree after the libraries are installed. With these three adjustments the image will build successfully and the container will start.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build likely fails because the ZIP archive puts the binary inside a sub‑directory (e.g. gogs_0.11.0_linux_amd64/gogs) but the Dockerfile later tries to chmod and run “/app/gogs/gogs”, which doesn’t exist after extraction. Change the Dockerfile so that after unzip you move the binary (or the whole extracted folder) to “/app/gogs”, for example by adding a line like `mv /app/gogs/gogs_0.11.0_linux_amd64/* /app/gogs/ && rmdir /app/gogs/gogs_0.11.0_linux_amd64` before the chmod/chown step. This ensures the executable is at the expected path, after which the rest of the image builds correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
