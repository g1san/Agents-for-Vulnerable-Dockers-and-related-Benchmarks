    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20119993 is an information\u2011disclosure vulnerability in the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) demuxer of the FFmpeg multimedia framework. When FFmpeg parses an HLS playlist it does not correctly validate the filename extensions or demuxer names that appear in the playlist. An attacker can supply a malicious HLS playlist (for example through a web service that accepts user\u2011uploaded media files) that contains a reference to an arbitrary path on the host file system such as \"/etc/passwd\" or uses a crafted demuxer name. The vulnerable FFmpeg instance follows the reference, opens the file without any permission checks, and streams the file contents back to the attacker as part of the transcoded output. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to read any readable file on the system, including configuration files, credentials, source code, or other sensitive data. No code execution is required; the impact is limited to disclosure of file contents.",
