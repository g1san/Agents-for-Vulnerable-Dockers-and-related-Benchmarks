CVE description: CVE‑2023‑35042 is a remote code execution vulnerability in GeoServer's Web Processing Service (WPS). The flaw resides in the processing of a WPS Execute request that contains a Jiffle script or a literal data element. The content of the `wps:LiteralData` (or the Jiffle `script` input) is taken and handed directly to the Java runtime without proper sanitisation. The supplied text is compiled by the Janino JIT compiler and executed, which allows an attacker to embed a call to `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)`. By sending a crafted WPS request an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause the GeoServer process to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands with the privileges of the GeoServer service, leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when the WPS service is enabled and the default Janino library is present in the GeoServer web application. Mitigation requires upgrading GeoServer to a version that contains the patch for the Jiffle/Janino code‑generation issue (or removing the Janino jar), or disabling the WPS service entirely.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][geoserver][['2.18.6', '2.19.6', '2.20.4']] Core GeoServer service that contains the vulnerable WPS implementation. These specific versions are known to be vulnerable to CVE‑2023‑35042.
- [SOFT-BASE][openjdk][['11-jre-slim']] Java runtime environment required by the GeoServer Docker image to execute the Java application.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup contains two images: a custom PHP/Apache image (based on php:8.1.0-apache) and a MySQL 5.7 image. No image or service related to geoserver is present, so the required 'geoserver' service is not used, and consequently no vulnerable geoserver version (2.18.6, 2.19.6, 2.20.4) is employed. Likewise, the configuration does not include an openjdk service. Because the required services ['geoserver', 'openjdk'] are missing, the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Since no geoserver version is used, the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup contains two images: a custom PHP/Apache image (based on php:8.1.0-apache) and a MySQL 5.7 image. No image or service related to geoserver is present, so the required 'geoserver' service is not used, and consequently no vulnerable geoserver version (2.18.6, 2.19.6, 2.20.4) is employed. Likewise, the configuration does not include an openjdk service. Because the required services ['geoserver', 'openjdk'] are missing, the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Since no geoserver version is used, the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- FIX: To satisfy the missing geoserver and openjdk requirements you need to add a GeoServer service to the compose file that runs a patched version (≥ 2.20.5) together with a compatible JDK image, for example openjdk:11‑jre‑slim, and link it to the existing PHP app if needed. In docker‑compose.yml declare a new geoserver service that pulls geoserver:2.20.5‑or‑later (or builds from source with the Janino fix) and set JAVA_OPTS or GEOSERVER_JAVA_OPTS to use the OpenJDK image, mounting any required data volumes. Update the app service’s dependencies to include geoserver so that health checks wait for it, and ensure the environment variables point to the correct host and port. This modification introduces the required hard‑version service and provides the necessary JDK runtime, allowing the overall stack to pass the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑Apache image does not have the build tools and MySQL client libraries needed to compile the mysqli extension, so the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` step aborts. Fix it by updating the Dockerfile to install the required packages before invoking the extension installer (e.g., run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libzip-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`). After adding the apt‑get line (or switching to a newer tag such as `php:8.1-apache` that already includes the dependencies) the image builds successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image is trying to compile the `mysqli` extension without first installing the MySQL client libraries that provide the header files it needs; the package name in the current `apt‑get` line (`default‑mysql‑client`) only pulls in the client binary, not the development headers, so `docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli` aborts. Fix the problem by installing the development package (`default‑mysql‑client‑dev` or `libmariadb-dev‑compatible`) before running `docker-php-ext-install`. In practice you can change the `RUN` line in `app/Dockerfile` to something like:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client libmariadb-dev-compat libzip-dev \
    && docker-php-ext-install mysqli \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

(Any equivalent MySQL dev package works.) After adding the dev package the `mysqli` extension compiles successfully and the image builds without errors.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image tries to compile the mysqli extension without the required development libraries, so the `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` step aborts. Fix it by installing the PHP‑dev header packages (e.g., apt‑get install -y libzip-dev libpng-dev zlib1g-dev) before running `docker-php-ext-install`, and then clean up the apt cache in the same layer; the revised Dockerfile would update the package list, install the MySQL client together with the build‑essential packages needed for the extension, run `docker-php-ext-install mysqli`, and finally remove the temporary files. After adding those dependencies the image builds successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP container tries to compile the mysqli extension without first installing the required build tools and headers; adding the “build-essential” and “pkg-config” packages to the apt‑get line (or installing the “php-mysqli” meta‑package) resolves the compilation error, and then removing the clean‑up step that deletes the apt list before the extension is built ensures the files are still available. At the same time the compose file references an unnecessary “openjdk” service that isn’t used by any other service, so deleting that service (or renaming it to avoid colliding with the official image name) eliminates the ambiguous image pull error. After these two small changes the Docker image builds successfully and the stack starts.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image can’t compile the mysqli extension with the current package list – libmariadb-dev doesn’t provide the headers required by docker-php-ext-install. Replace it with the MySQL development package (for example default‑mysql-client plus default‑mysql‑server‑dev or libmysqlclient-dev), then run the extension installation, and keep the cleanup step. After that the Dockerfile will look like: update apt‑get, install build‑essential pkg‑config default‑mysql‑client default‑mysql‑server‑dev libzip-dev zlib1g-dev, then docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli, and finally clean the apt cache. This resolves the compile error and lets the image build successfully. (If you also want to remove the intentional PHP unserialize vulnerability, replace the unserialize($_GET['data']) call with safe handling such as JSON decoding or input validation.)


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑Apache image tries to install a package that doesn’t exist (`default‑mysql‑server‑dev`). Replace that line with the proper development library (`default‑mysql‑client` or `libmysqlclient-dev`) and remove the stray `default‑mysql-server‑dev` reference; after updating the `apt‑get install` command the image will compile successfully. In addition, the `geoserver` service does not need the separate `openjdk` container – the `osgeo/geoserver` image already contains a JRE – so you can drop the `openjdk` service and its `depends_on` clause to avoid a superfluous startup dependency that can also cause the compose sequence to stall. With those two small changes the Docker‑Compose stack will build and start without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image tries to compile extensions but the required libraries aren’t all present; in particular the `zip` extension (which many PHP base images expect) is missing, causing `docker-php-ext-install` to abort. To fix it, amend the Dockerfile’s `RUN` line so that after installing `libzip-dev` you also run `docker-php-ext-install zip` (and, if you need it later, any other extensions such as `gd` that require additional libs). Keeping the whole command in a single `RUN` instruction ensures the packages stay in the layer’s cache and the build succeeds. After adding the extra `docker-php-ext-install zip` step, rebuild the image and the compose stack will start without the previous error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image build fails because the PHP container is trying to install the mysqli and zip extensions without first installing all of the native libraries they depend on, and it also never installs the PDO‑MySQL driver that the application later uses to talk to the database. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile so the apt‑get line pulls in the required development packages (including libzip-dev and default-mysql-client as you already have, plus libpng-dev and libjpeg-dev for the zip extension), then install both the mysqli and pdo_mysql extensions with docker-php-ext-install before cleaning up the apt cache. In practice the change looks like adding `docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql` after the existing `docker-php-ext-install mysqli zip` command (or combining them into a single `docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo_mysql zip` call). Once those extensions are successfully compiled, the PHP image will build without errors and the rest of the compose stack can start normally.
