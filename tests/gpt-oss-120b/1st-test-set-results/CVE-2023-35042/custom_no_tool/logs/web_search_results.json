    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201135042 is a remote code execution vulnerability in GeoServer's Web Processing Service (WPS). The flaw resides in the processing of a WPS Execute request that contains a Jiffle script or a literal data element. The content of the `wps:LiteralData` (or the Jiffle `script` input) is taken and handed directly to the Java runtime without proper sanitisation. The supplied text is compiled by the Janino JIT compiler and executed, which allows an attacker to embed a call to `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)`. By sending a crafted WPS request an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause the GeoServer process to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the GeoServer service, leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when the WPS service is enabled and the default Janino library is present in the GeoServer web application. Mitigation requires upgrading GeoServer to a version that contains the patch for the Jiffle/Janino code\u2011generation issue (or removing the Janino jar), or disabling the WPS service entirely.",
