    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20111000028 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability affecting Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.1. The server fails to properly limit the pathname that a client can request, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to include \"../\" (or equivalent) sequences in an HTTP GET request. By doing so the attacker can escape the web\u2011application\u2019s document root and read arbitrary files from the host file system, such as configuration files, source code, password files, or any other readable data. The flaw has a low complexity, requires no authentication or special privileges, and does not require any user interaction. Successful exploitation results in high\u2011confidence confidentiality loss and can be a stepping stone toward further compromise, such as credential theft or privilege escalation. Public exploits exist and the vulnerability is rated 7.5 (High) on the CVSS v3.0 scale.",
