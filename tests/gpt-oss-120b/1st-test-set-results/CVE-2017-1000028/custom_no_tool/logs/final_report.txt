CVE description: CVE‑2017‑1000028 is a directory‑traversal vulnerability affecting Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.1. The server fails to properly limit the pathname that a client can request, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to include "../" (or equivalent) sequences in an HTTP GET request. By doing so the attacker can escape the web‑application’s document root and read arbitrary files from the host file system, such as configuration files, source code, password files, or any other readable data. The flaw has a low complexity, requires no authentication or special privileges, and does not require any user interaction. Successful exploitation results in high‑confidence confidentiality loss and can be a stepping stone toward further compromise, such as credential theft or privilege escalation. Public exploits exist and the vulnerability is rated 7.5 (High) on the CVSS v3.0 scale.
Attack Type: directory traversal

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To fix the build failure, first examine the Dockerfile for any syntax errors such as missing backslashes on multi‑line RUN statements or incorrect instruction ordering, and correct them; then verify that every file or directory referenced by COPY/ADD actually exists in the build context and that the paths are relative to the Dockerfile location. Make sure the base image tag you are using is valid and available, and adjust any package‑installation commands to match the package manager of that base image (for example, using apt‑get for Debian‑based images or yum for CentOS‑based ones). Finally, run the build with the --no-cache option to force a fresh start and confirm that each step completes without errors before proceeding.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `COPY` instruction points to a directory that doesn’t exist in the base image – the `GLASSFISH_HOME` variable isn’t expanded for the destination path in this context, and GlassFish expects a packaged WAR rather than raw files in the autodeploy folder. To fix it, add an explicit `ENV GLASSFISH_HOME=/opt/glassfish` (or the correct path for the chosen image) before the `COPY` line so Docker knows where to place the files, and create a proper `webapp.war` archive from the `webapp` directory (e.g., `RUN cd webapp && jar cf /tmp/webapp.war .`) and then copy that WAR into `$GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/`. This ensures the destination exists and GlassFish can deploy the application without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the WAR is being created from an empty context – the jar command is run in /tmp/webapp but doesn’t include any files, so it exits with an error. Change the Dockerfile to create the archive from the contents of the directory (for example RUN cd /tmp/webapp && jar cf /tmp/webapp.war . ) and then move that file into the GlassFish autodeploy folder. Also make sure the asadmin binary is on the PATH (or invoke it with its full path, /opt/glassfish/bin/asadmin) so the container can start correctly. After those two edits the image builds without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base GlassFish image does not have the `domain1/autodeploy` directory ready for a plain `mv`, so the `RUN mv …` step cannot find the target path. Change the Dockerfile to let GlassFish create the domain first and then deploy the WAR with the built‑in `asadmin` command—replace the two `RUN mkdir…` and `RUN mv…` lines with a single line that runs `asadmin start-domain --verbose` (or `asadmin create-domain domain1` if needed) followed by `asadmin deploy /tmp/webapp.war`. This guarantees the autodeploy folder exists and uses the proper deployment mechanism, eliminating the permission/path error and allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `asadmin start-domain --verbose` command is invoked during the image build; the `--verbose` flag makes GlassFish stay attached to the console and never return, so the Docker build hangs and eventually aborts. Replace that line with a plain `asadmin start-domain` (or `asadmin start-domain --nopretty`) so the daemon starts, returns control, the WAR can be deployed, and then the domain is stopped; the final CMD will launch the server in foreground at container run‑time. In practice the fix is to edit the Dockerfile’s RUN instruction to remove `--verbose` (or use `--dry-run` if you only need to check syntax) and keep the start‑deploy‑stop sequence, which allows the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because you try to start a GlassFish domain inside the image‑building stage – the server expects a running JVM, a proper domain configuration and a writeable home directory, none of which are reliably available while Docker is assembling the layer. The simplest fix is to remove the start‑domain / deploy / stop‑domain sequence from the Dockerfile and instead place the generated WAR in GlassFish’s autodeploy folder so that the container’s entry‑point can launch the domain and automatically deploy the application at runtime. Replace the three‑line RUN that invokes asadmin with a single COPY (or MOV) that puts /tmp/webapp.war into /opt/glassfish/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/, and keep the CMD that starts the domain in foreground; this eliminates the build‑time error while preserving the intended functionality.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `jar` command that creates the WAR file isn’t available in the GlassFish‑4.1‑jdk8 image’s default PATH, so the `RUN jar cf /tmp/webapp.war .` step aborts. To fix it, add a step that installs the JDK’s `zip`/`jar` utilities (for example, `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk` or, if the JDK is already present but not on PATH, prepend the full path like `RUN /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/jar cf /tmp/webapp.war .`). After ensuring the `jar` tool is accessible, the remainder of the Dockerfile works unchanged, and the container will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base image glassfish:4.1‑jdk8 already contains a full JDK, so the `apt‑get install openjdk‑8‑jdk` step either can’t find an apt package list or tries to reinstall a conflicting JDK, causing the layer to abort. Remove that `RUN apt‑get …` line entirely and rely on the JDK that’s baked into the GlassFish image; the `jar` tool will then be available. After that, keep the copy of the webapp, change to the temporary directory, create the WAR with `jar cf /opt/glassfish/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/webapp.war .` (so you don’t need a separate `mv` step), and the container will build and start correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `jar` command is creating an empty WAR – it’s run from `/tmp/webapp` but never tells `jar` which files to package, so the command exits with an error. The fix is to change the `RUN` line so that the `jar` invocation includes the current directory (or a specific set of files) and uses the proper syntax for expanding the `GLASSFISH_HOME` variable. Set the environment variable before it’s used, then create the autodeploy directory and package the webapp like this:

```
ENV GLASSFISH_HOME=/opt/glassfish
WORKDIR /tmp/webapp
RUN mkdir -p $GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy && \
    jar cf $GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/webapp.war -C /tmp/webapp .
```

Here `-C /tmp/webapp .` tells `jar` to include all files under `/tmp/webapp` in the WAR, eliminating the empty‑archive error and allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
