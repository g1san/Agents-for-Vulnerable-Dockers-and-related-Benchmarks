    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20117600, also known as Drupalgeddon2, is a critical remote\u2011code\u2011execution vulnerability in the Drupal content\u2011management system. The flaw resides in the Form API rendering pipeline where array keys that begin with the character \u2018#\u2019 are not sufficiently sanitised. When an attacker supplies a specially crafted renderable array via an unauthenticated AJAX request (for example to /user/register, /user/password or other default form endpoints), the Form API evaluates keys such as #post_render, #pre_render, #access_callback and #lazy_builder. These keys can contain arbitrary PHP code that is then executed by the web\u2011server process. The exploitation path typically involves sending a POST request with form\u2011encoded or multipart data that injects a PHP function such as exec, system, passthru, eval or shell_exec together with a command (often a wget or curl to fetch a second\u2011stage payload). Successful exploitation yields full remote command execution as the web\u2011server user, allowing the attacker to install web\u2011shells, run cryptominers, exfiltrate data or otherwise compromise the host. The vulnerability affects Drupal core versions prior to the patched releases and requires only network access to the vulnerable Drupal web service; no authentication or additional services are required for the attack.",
