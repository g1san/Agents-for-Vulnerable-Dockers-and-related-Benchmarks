CVE description: CVE‑2018‑7600, also known as Drupalgeddon2, is a critical remote‑code‑execution vulnerability in the Drupal content‑management system. The flaw resides in the Form API rendering pipeline where array keys that begin with the character ‘#’ are not sufficiently sanitised. When an attacker supplies a specially crafted renderable array via an unauthenticated AJAX request (for example to /user/register, /user/password or other default form endpoints), the Form API evaluates keys such as #post_render, #pre_render, #access_callback and #lazy_builder. These keys can contain arbitrary PHP code that is then executed by the web‑server process. The exploitation path typically involves sending a POST request with form‑encoded or multipart data that injects a PHP function such as exec, system, passthru, eval or shell_exec together with a command (often a wget or curl to fetch a second‑stage payload). Successful exploitation yields full remote command execution as the web‑server user, allowing the attacker to install web‑shells, run cryptominers, exfiltrate data or otherwise compromise the host. The vulnerability affects Drupal core versions prior to the patched releases and requires only network access to the vulnerable Drupal web service; no authentication or additional services are required for the attack.

This service is the essential component that must be present and vulnerable to reproduce CVE‑2018‑7600.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.25.2']] Web server that serves the Drupal application over HTTP/HTTPS. Required to run the Docker container but not part of the vulnerability itself.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Relational database used by Drupal to store site data. Needed for Drupal to operate in a Docker environment.

	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The MySQL container (service 'db') only exposes ports 3306/tcp and 33060/tcp internally (PortBindings is empty). No host‑port mapping is defined, so the database is not reachable from the host on its default port 3306. In contrast, the Drupal container publishes port 80 as host port 8080, which changes the external access port. Because at least one service is not accessible on its expected default network port, the network_setup milestone is not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The MySQL container (service 'db') only exposes ports 3306/tcp and 33060/tcp internally (PortBindings is empty).

In contrast, the Drupal container publishes port 80 as host port 8080, which changes the external access port. Because at least one service is not accessible on its expected default network port, the network_setup milestone is not satisfied.
	- FIX: Add a port mapping for the MySQL service in the compose file, for example under db add a ports section with "3306:3306" so the container’s MySQL port is bound to the host’s 3306 (and optionally "33060:33060" if you need the X Protocol). This makes the database reachable from the host at its standard port and satisfies the network‑setup requirement while leaving the rest of the configuration unchanged.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Drupal service maps container port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default HTTP port 80, so it is not exposed on its default network port. MySQL uses its default ports (3306, 33060), but because the Drupal container does not use the default host port, the network_setup milestone is not met.

MySQL uses its default ports (3306, 33060), but because the Drupal container does not use the default host port, the network_setup milestone is not met.
	- FIX: To meet the network‑setup requirement you need to expose Drupal on the standard HTTP port, so edit the docker‑compose.yml and change the port mapping for the drupal service from "8080:80" to "80:80". After saving the file, restart the compose stack (e.g., docker‑compose down && docker‑compose up -d) so the container’s port 80 is bound to the host’s port 80, making the service reachable on its default network port.


Docker is running correctly with 2 containers!
