CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11978 is a critical vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.11. The flaw resides in the default example DAGs that are shipped with Airflow when the configuration option `load_examples` is set to true. One of these DAGs, `example_trigger_target_dag`, contains a task that builds a shell command from user‑controlled input without proper sanitisation. When the experimental REST API (which is enabled and unauthenticated by default in vulnerable releases) is used to trigger a run of this example DAG, an attacker can supply a malicious payload in the DAG‑run configuration. The payload is interpolated into the vulnerable command and executed on the Airflow worker or scheduler host with the same privileges as the Airflow process. This results in unauthenticated remote code execution, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary operating‑system commands on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable even if the Airflow web UI is protected, because the experimental API does not inherit UI authentication. Mitigation steps include disabling the example DAGs (`load_examples = False`), upgrading Airflow to version 1.10.11 or later (or any 2.0.0+ release where the experimental API is disabled by default), and configuring the experimental API to require authentication.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The image is built from the docker:19.03.12 base image and contains only a custom entrypoint script. No apache/airflow component is installed, so the image does not use any of the listed vulnerable airflow versions, and the required apache/airflow service is absent.
	- ERROR: The image is built from the docker:19.03.12 base image and contains only a custom entrypoint script. No apache/airflow component is installed, so the image does not use any of the listed vulnerable airflow versions, and the required apache/airflow service is absent.
	- FIX: To eliminate the exploitation surface, remove the privileged flag and the bind‑mount of the host Docker socket from the compose file, and run the container as a non‑root user; for example, change the service definition to omit `privileged: true` and the `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` volume line, add a `user: 1000:1000` entry, and rebuild the image. This prevents the container from accessing the host Docker daemon and eliminates the ability to enumerate or control other containers, thereby mitigating the CVE‑related risk.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile creates a user with syntax that doesn’t exist in the Airflow base image and then switches to that user before the entry‑point script is owned by it, so the copy or chmod step can’t be performed. Fix it by creating the user with a command that works on the underlying OS (for example `RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash -u 1000 airflow_user && mkdir -p /home/airflow_user && chown -R airflow_user:airflow_user /home/airflow_user`) **before** switching to it, then copy the entry‑point script and set its executable flag while still running as root, and finally add `USER airflow_user`. Alternatively, simply omit the custom user lines and let the image run as the default `airflow` user, which already has a non‑root UID, and the rest of the Dockerfile will build without error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build itself succeeds – the container crashes when it tries to run `airflow initdb` because the base Airflow image expects a valid SQL‑Alchemy connection string and the simple command array you used (`command: ["/entrypoint.sh"]`) does not invoke a shell, so the script is never interpreted correctly. Fix it by adding a default SQLite connection (or any other DB you prefer) to the environment and by calling the entry‑point through the shell, for example:

```yaml
services:
  airflow:
    build: ./airflow
    environment:
      - AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES=False
      - AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=SequentialExecutor
      - AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=sqlite:////root/airflow/airflow.db
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    command: ["sh", "/entrypoint.sh"]
```

The Dockerfile can stay unchanged; the only required modifications are the added `AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN` variable (so `initdb` can create the metadata DB) and the explicit `sh` invocation, which ensures the entrypoint script runs as intended and the container starts without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is exiting because the SQLite database is being created under /root/airflow, which the non‑root airflow user cannot write to, and the entrypoint only launches the webserver so the scheduler never starts. Change the SQLAlchemy connection string to point to a directory owned by the airflow user (for example sqlite:////usr/local/airflow/airflow.db or mount a host volume to /opt/airflow) and make sure that directory exists and is writable. Then modify entrypoint.sh so it launches both the webserver and the scheduler, e.g. run airflow webserver in the background and then exec airflow scheduler as the final command. After rebuilding the image and restarting the service the container should stay up and the Airflow UI will be functional.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Update the entrypoint so that it uses the current Airflow database‑initialisation command and ensures the scheduler starts only after the webserver is ready. Replace the two‑line init section with “airflow db init” (the command that replaced airflow initdb in later 1.10.x releases) and add a short sleep or a health‑check loop before launching the scheduler. Then change the compose service command to invoke the script directly (e.g. command: ["/entrypoint.sh"]) so the container’s PID 1 is the script itself. This corrects the startup sequence and eliminates the initdb error that prevents the container from staying up.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the entrypoint script is using commands that don’t exist in Airflow 1.10.10 and is trying to run both the webserver and the scheduler in the same process while the SequentialExecutor only allows one worker. Change the script to initialise the metadata with `airflow initdb` (the correct command for that version), start the webserver in the foreground (`exec airflow webserver`) and move the scheduler to a separate service in the compose file, or run it in the background instead of foreground. After updating the entrypoint and adding a second “scheduler” service (or removing the background webserver start), the container should come up correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the `entrypoint.sh` script is copied as root, marked executable, and then the image switches back to the non‑root `airflow` user without adjusting the file’s ownership; the `airflow` user therefore cannot execute the script and the container exits immediately. Fix it by ensuring the script is owned by the `airflow` user (or by leaving the image as root when the script runs) and by updating the script to use the current database‑initialisation command. In the Dockerfile, after copying the script add a `chown airflow:airflow /entrypoint.sh` (or move the `USER airflow` line after the `chmod` and `chown` steps), and in `entrypoint.sh` replace `airflow initdb` with `airflow db init` (the newer command that works in all 1.10.x releases). With these changes the script can run under the `airflow` user, the metadata DB will be created, and the webserver will start correctly.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The scheduler container is failing because it never runs the database‑initialisation step that the web‑server container performs in its custom entrypoint, so when it starts the Airflow scheduler the SQLite metadata DB is missing and the process exits. To fix it, change the scheduler service to invoke the same entrypoint script (or a variant of it) before launching the scheduler, for example by replacing its `command:` line with something like `command: ["sh","/entrypoint.sh","scheduler"]` and updating `entrypoint.sh` to accept an optional argument that, after ensuring the DB exists, runs either `airflow webserver` (default) or `airflow scheduler` when the argument is “scheduler”. This guarantees the DB is created in both containers and lets the scheduler start correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The easiest way to get the stack running is to let only one container initialise the SQLite metadata – the web‑server – and skip the `airflow db init` step when the scheduler starts, because the race between the two services leaves the scheduler crashing with a “database already exists” error. Change the entrypoint script so the init block runs only when `$COMPONENT` is `webserver` (or simply omit the check for the scheduler), then rebuild the image and restart the compose; the scheduler will now start cleanly and both services will share the same persistent volume without stepping on each other.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
