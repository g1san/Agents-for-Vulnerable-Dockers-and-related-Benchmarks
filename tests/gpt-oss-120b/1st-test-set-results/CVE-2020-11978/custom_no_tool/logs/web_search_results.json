    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201111978 is a critical vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions prior to 1.10.11. The flaw resides in the default example DAGs that are shipped with Airflow when the configuration option `load_examples` is set to true. One of these DAGs, `example_trigger_target_dag`, contains a task that builds a shell command from user\u2011controlled input without proper sanitisation. When the experimental REST API (which is enabled and unauthenticated by default in vulnerable releases) is used to trigger a run of this example DAG, an attacker can supply a malicious payload in the DAG\u2011run configuration. The payload is interpolated into the vulnerable command and executed on the Airflow worker or scheduler host with the same privileges as the Airflow process. This results in unauthenticated remote code execution, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable even if the Airflow web UI is protected, because the experimental API does not inherit UI authentication. Mitigation steps include disabling the example DAGs (`load_examples = False`), upgrading Airflow to version 1.10.11 or later (or any 2.0.0+ release where the experimental API is disabled by default), and configuring the experimental API to require authentication.",
