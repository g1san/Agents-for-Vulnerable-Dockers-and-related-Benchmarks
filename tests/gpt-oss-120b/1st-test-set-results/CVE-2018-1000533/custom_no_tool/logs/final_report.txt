CVE description: CVE‑2018‑1000533 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the PHP‑Unit testing framework and the GitList web application. In PHP‑Unit the vulnerable `eval‑stdin.php` endpoint accepts attacker‑controlled data and passes it to PHP's `eval` function, allowing execution of arbitrary PHP code. In GitList (versions up to 0.6) the `searchTree` function incorporates unsanitised user input into a system‑level command, enabling an attacker to run arbitrary shell commands on the host. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control of the compromised system with the privileges of the PHP process, which can lead to data theft, malware deployment, or further lateral movement within the network.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][phpunit/phpunit][['4.8.36', '5.7.27', '5.8.23', '6.5.14', '7.0.33', '7.1.33', '7.2.34', '7.3.33', '7.4.33', '8.0.28', '8.1.23', '8.2.10']] Vulnerable PHP‑Unit installation that contains the `eval‑stdin.php` endpoint. These specific versions are known to be affected by CVE‑2018‑1000533 and allow unauthenticated remote code execution.
- [HARD][gitlist/gitlist][['0.5.0', '0.5.1', '0.5.2', '0.5.3', '0.5.4', '0.5.5', '0.5.6', '0.5.7', '0.5.8', '0.5.9', '0.5.10', '0.5.11', '0.5.12', '0.5.13', '0.5.14', '0.5.15', '0.5.16', '0.5.17', '0.5.18', '0.5.19', '0.5.20', '0.5.21', '0.5.22', '0.5.23', '0.5.24', '0.5.25', '0.5.26', '0.5.27', '0.5.28', '0.5.29', '0.5.30', '0.5.31', '0.5.32', '0.5.33', '0.5.34', '0.5.35', '0.5.36', '0.5.37', '0.5.38', '0.5.39', '0.5.40', '0.5.41', '0.5.42', '0.5.43', '0.5.44', '0.5.45', '0.5.46', '0.5.47', '0.5.48', '0.5.49', '0.5.50', '0.5.51', '0.5.52', '0.5.53', '0.5.54', '0.5.55', '0.5.56', '0.5.57', '0.5.58', '0.5.59', '0.5.60', '0.5.61', '0.5.62', '0.5.63', '0.5.64', '0.5.65', '0.5.66', '0.5.67', '0.5.68', '0.5.69', '0.5.70', '0.5.71', '0.5.72', '0.5.73', '0.5.74', '0.5.75', '0.5.76', '0.5.77', '0.5.77', '0.6.0']] Vulnerable GitList web application (≤ 0.6) where the `searchTree` function executes a system command with unsanitised user input, leading to remote code execution.
- [SOFT-WEB][php:8.0-fpm][['8.0']] Base PHP environment required to run the vulnerable PHP‑Unit or GitList code. It provides the PHP interpreter and FPM process needed for the web application.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21']] Lightweight web server to expose the vulnerable PHP‑Unit or GitList application on a network port. No authentication or additional modules are required.
- [SOFT-DB][mysql][['5.7']] Optional database service for GitList when a repository index is stored in MySQL. It is not required for the exploitation of CVE‑2018‑1000533 but is included to keep the environment functional for typical GitList deployments.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the *vulnerable_app* service never starts is that it tries to pull the image from localhost:5000, but inside that container “localhost” points to itself rather than to the registry service; change the command to use the service name (e.g. `docker pull registry:5000/malicious && docker run registry:5000/malicious`) and optionally add a small wait loop or health‑check so the pull only runs after the registry is ready, which will allow the container to start correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the **`vulnerable_app`** container is trying to pull an image (`registry:5000/malicious`) that never exists in the local registry, and the image it builds from `./malicious` does not contain the Docker client needed to talk to the daemon. To resolve this, change the `malicious/Dockerfile` so it is based on an image that already includes the Docker CLI (for example `docker:20.10-cli-alpine`), or install the CLI inside the Alpine image with `apk add --no‑cache docker-cli`. Then, after the image is built, tag it with the registry address and push it to the local registry as part of the startup sequence (or simply run the locally‑built image without pulling). A minimal fix is to replace the entrypoint script with:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while ! curl -s http://registry:5000/v2/_catalog > /dev/null; do
  echo "Waiting for registry..."
  sleep 2
done

echo "Tagging and pushing malicious image..."
docker tag malicious registry:5000/malicious
docker push registry:5000/malicious

echo "Running malicious container..."
docker run --rm registry:5000/malicious
```

and ensure the `Dockerfile` installs the Docker client, for example:

```Dockerfile
FROM docker:20.10-cli-alpine
RUN echo "Malicious container for CVE-2018-1000533 demonstration" > /malicious.txt
CMD ["cat", "/malicious.txt"]
```

With the CLI present and the image correctly pushed to the local registry before it is pulled, the compose stack will start without the previous build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the vulnerable_app service is using the thin docker:20.10-cli-alpine image, which does not contain the curl binary that the entry‑point script relies on; the script also needs to be executable inside the container. The quick fix is to create a small Dockerfile for vulnerable_app that installs curl (and any other missing utilities) and ensures the script has the proper execute flag, then reference that Dockerfile in the compose file. For example, add a Dockerfile in ./vulnerable_app with:

```
FROM docker:20.10-cli-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/entrypoint.sh"]
```

and change the vulnerable_app service definition to build: ./vulnerable_app instead of using the raw CLI image. This supplies curl, makes the script runnable, and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `vulnerable_app` Dockerfile expects the `entrypoint.sh` script to be present at `/app/entrypoint.sh` and to be executable, but the copy command creates the file before the `/app` directory exists, so the subsequent `chmod` cannot find the target. Fix it by creating the target directory first and then copying the script, for example by adding a line `RUN mkdir -p /app` before the `COPY` instruction (or by copying into an existing directory such as `/` and adjusting the `ENTRYPOINT` path accordingly). Once the directory exists the script can be copied and marked executable, and the image will build without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
