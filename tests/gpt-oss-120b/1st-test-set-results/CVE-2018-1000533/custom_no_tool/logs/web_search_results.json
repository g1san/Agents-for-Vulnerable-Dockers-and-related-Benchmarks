{
    "desc": "CVE-2018-1000533 is a remote command execution vulnerability in the GitList web application (a PHP\u2011based interface for browsing Git repositories). The flaw resides in the function that builds a system command from a request parameter (such as the \"view\" or search path) without proper sanitisation. An unauthenticated attacker can supply specially crafted input that is passed directly to the underlying operating system, allowing execution of arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the web\u2011server process. This can lead to full compromise of the host running GitList.",
