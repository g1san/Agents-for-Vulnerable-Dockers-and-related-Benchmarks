    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20111000533 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the PHP\u2011Unit testing framework and the GitList web application. In PHP\u2011Unit the vulnerable `eval\u2011stdin.php` endpoint accepts attacker\u2011controlled data and passes it to PHP's `eval` function, allowing execution of arbitrary PHP code. In GitList (versions up to 0.6) the `searchTree` function incorporates unsanitised user input into a system\u2011level command, enabling an attacker to run arbitrary shell commands on the host. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control of the compromised system with the privileges of the PHP process, which can lead to data theft, malware deployment, or further lateral movement within the network.",
