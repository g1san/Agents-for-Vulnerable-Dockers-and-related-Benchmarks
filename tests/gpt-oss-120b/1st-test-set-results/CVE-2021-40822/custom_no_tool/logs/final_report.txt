----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2021‑40822 is a high‑severity Server‑Side Request Forgery vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the handling of user‑supplied URL parameters such as `url`, `remoteOgcService`, `proxyHost`, or the `TestWfsPost` servlet. GeoServer processes these values without proper validation and initiates an outbound HTTP(S) request to the supplied address. An unauthenticated attacker can therefore force the GeoServer instance to contact internal services (e.g., cloud‑metadata endpoints, internal APIs, admin consoles) or external resources, leading to information disclosure, internal network scanning, or serving as a foothold for further attacks. The vulnerability is present in many early GeoServer releases and is fixed only in the patched versions 2.18.6, 2.19.3, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2 onward. Exploitation requires only the vulnerable GeoServer service; no additional components are needed.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container fails because the image you build from `alpine:3.14` never runs a web server – you copy the HTML file to the nginx directory but you never install or start nginx, so the service on port 80 never comes up and the container exits as soon as the script finishes its initial checks. Switch the base image to an actual nginx image (for example `nginx:alpine`), keep the docker‑cli installed for the exploit script, and launch both nginx and the script together. In the Dockerfile replace `FROM alpine:3.14` with `FROM nginx:alpine`, add the line `RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli` (or install the client via the package manager), keep the `COPY` commands, and change the CMD to something like `sh -c "nginx -g 'daemon off;' & /app/exploit.sh"` so that nginx stays listening on port 80 while the exploit script runs in the background. This small change restores the web service and prevents the container from crashing.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the vulnerable_app service tries to run both nginx and the exploit script in a single shell command, launching nginx in the background (`nginx -g 'daemon off;' &`) and then immediately starting the script, which ends with `sleep infinity`. This means the primary process for the container is the shell running the script, not nginx, so when the script terminates or fails the whole container stops, and the background nginx process is not properly attached to PID 1. To fix it, replace the `CMD` line in the Dockerfile with an entrypoint script that starts nginx in the foreground (using `exec nginx -g 'daemon off;'`) and runs the exploit script as a background job, or run the exploit script from a separate side‑car container. Additionally, ensure the Docker daemon service is reachable by giving the `docker` service a fixed network alias (e.g., `container_name: docker`) and confirm that the host’s port 2375 is not already bound by another daemon; if it is, change the exposed port to avoid a conflict. After these changes the compose file will bring up the Docker‑in‑Docker service first, the vulnerable_app will successfully connect to it, and nginx will stay alive as the container’s main process.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file defines only two services: "docker" (image docker:dind) and "vulnerable_app" (built from a Dockerfile that uses FROM nginx:alpine). No service uses the osgeo/geoserver image, so the required service is missing, causing services_ok to be false. Because osgeo/geoserver is not present, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable version list, meaning the code does not use a vulnerable version of that service, so code_hard_version is also false.
	- ERROR: The compose file defines only two services: "docker" (image docker:dind) and "vulnerable_app" (built from a Dockerfile that uses FROM nginx:alpine). No service uses the osgeo/geoserver image, so the required service is missing, causing services_ok to be false. Because osgeo/geoserver is not present, there is no version to compare against the vulnerable version list, meaning the code does not use a vulnerable version of that service, so code_hard_version is also false.
	- FIX: Add a third service to the compose file that builds or pulls the osgeo/geoserver image and runs the vulnerable versions listed. For example, define a geoserver service that uses image: osgeo/geoserver:2.19.2 (or any of the versions in the vulnerable range), expose its HTTP port, and make the vulnerable_app depend on it if needed. This ensures the required GeoServer component is present so the version check can detect the vulnerable release and the overall configuration passes the services_ok and code_hard_version tests.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the **vulnerable_app** Dockerfile tries to install a package that doesn’t exist in the Alpine repositories – `docker-cli`. Change the install line to pull the correct Alpine Docker client package (simply `docker`) and then make sure the scripts are executable after they are copied. In practice you would replace

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli curl
```

with

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache docker curl
```

(and optionally add `&& chmod +x /app/*.sh` on the same line or keep the separate `chmod` command you already have). After this change the image builds successfully and the rest of the compose file can start the stack.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine image tries to install a package named docker that doesn’t exist in the default repositories – only the Docker client (docker‑cli) is available – so the apk add command aborts. Change the Dockerfile line that installs the tools to `RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli curl` and keep the rest of the steps unchanged; this will let the image compile and give the container the docker command it needs to talk to the DinD service. While you’re at it, move the DOCKER_HOST definition into the image itself (add `ENV DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375` to the Dockerfile) so the script can find the daemon without relying on the compose‑level environment block. Finally, because the exploit script tries to start a privileged container that mounts the host filesystem, mark the vulnerable_app service as privileged in docker‑compose.yml by adding `privileged: true` under its definition; this prevents the runtime error where Docker refuses to bind‑mount /:/hostfs from a non‑privileged container. With those three small edits – installing docker‑cli instead of the nonexistent docker package, setting DOCKER_HOST inside the image, and running the service privileged – the image will build successfully and the container will be able to execute the demonstration script.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine base image can’t find the **docker‑cli** package you ask for – in Alpine the Docker client is provided by the package named simply **docker** (the daemon package is “dockerd”). Change the `apk add` line in the vulnerable_app Dockerfile to install the correct package name, e.g.:

```
RUN apk add --no-cache docker curl
```

After that the rest of the Dockerfile (copying the three scripts, making them executable, exposing port 80 and setting the entrypoint) will build without error. If the files under `vulnerable_app/` (index.html, exploit.sh, entrypoint.sh) are correctly placed relative to the Dockerfile, no further changes are needed. Once rebuilt, the compose stack should start normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image is trying to install a package named **docker**, which does not exist in the Alpine repositories – only the Docker client (`docker-cli`) is provided. Change the line in `vulnerable_app/Dockerfile` that adds Alpine packages from  

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache docker curl
```  

to  

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli curl
```  

so the container gets the Docker client needed to talk to the DinD daemon at `tcp://docker:2375`. After this small change the image builds successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine base image does not provide a package called `docker-cli`; the Docker client is shipped in the package simply named `docker`. Change the line in `Dockerfile` that installs the tools from `RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli curl` to `RUN apk add --no-cache docker curl`. After that the image can be built, the entrypoint script will be executable (you already set the permissions), and the container will start nginx and run the exploit script as intended. If you still see errors, make sure the `docker` service defined in `docker‑compose.yml` is reachable via the network alias `docker` (the `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375` line is correct) and that the `docker` service exposes port 2375 on the host. Once the package name is fixed, the compose stack should come up without a build‑time failure.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine base image does not provide a package called `docker`; the client binary is shipped in the `docker-cli` package, so the `apk add` line aborts. Change the Dockerfile to install `docker-cli` (or `docker` from the community repo) instead of the non‑existent package, and keep the rest of the script unchanged. For example, replace the line  

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache docker curl
```  

with  

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli curl
```  

(or add the appropriate community repository before installing `docker`). After this small edit the image builds successfully and the compose stack can start.
