    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201140822 is a high\u2011severity Server\u2011Side Request Forgery vulnerability in GeoServer. The flaw resides in the handling of user\u2011supplied URL parameters such as `url`, `remoteOgcService`, `proxyHost`, or the `TestWfsPost` servlet. GeoServer processes these values without proper validation and initiates an outbound HTTP(S) request to the supplied address. An unauthenticated attacker can therefore force the GeoServer instance to contact internal services (e.g., cloud\u2011metadata endpoints, internal APIs, admin consoles) or external resources, leading to information disclosure, internal network scanning, or serving as a foothold for further attacks. The vulnerability is present in many early GeoServer releases and is fixed only in the patched versions 2.18.6, 2.19.3, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2 onward. Exploitation requires only the vulnerable GeoServer service; no additional components are needed.",
