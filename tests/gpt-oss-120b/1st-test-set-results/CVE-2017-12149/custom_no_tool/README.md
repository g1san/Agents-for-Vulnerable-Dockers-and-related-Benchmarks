# CVE-2017-12149 Demo Stack

This repository contains a minimal Docker Compose setup that recreates the environment affected by **CVE‑2017‑12149**.

- **jboss** – Runs the official `jboss/base-jbossas` image (version 7.2.0.Final), which includes the vulnerable `HTTP‑invoker` servlet.
- **openjdk** – A plain `openjdk:8-jdk-alpine` container kept alive for any auxiliary tasks (e.g., generating payloads with `ysoserial`).

The stack starts with a single `docker compose up --build -d` command and exposes the JBoss management interface on host port **8080**.

> **Note**: This setup is intended for controlled security‑research environments only. Do **not** expose it to untrusted networks.
