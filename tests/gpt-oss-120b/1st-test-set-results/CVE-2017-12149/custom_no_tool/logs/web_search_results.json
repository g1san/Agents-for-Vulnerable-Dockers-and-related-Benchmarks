    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201112149 is a critical remote\u2011code\u2011execution vulnerability that resides in the JBoss Application Server (also shipped with Red\u202fHat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and JBoss SOA\u2011Platform). The flaw exists in the HTTP\u2011invoker component (the servlet exposed under `/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet` or similar URLs). The servlet accepts serialized Java objects without validating the classes that are being deserialized. An attacker who can reach the JBoss HTTP/HTTPS port can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request that contains a malicious Java object (often generated with tools such as ysoserial). When the JBoss server deserializes this object, the attacker\u2011controlled code is executed with the privileges of the JBoss process, resulting in full remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability affects JBoss AS versions up to and including 7.2.0 and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.x (including the SOA\u2011Platform 5.3 module). The issue can be mitigated by upgrading to JBoss AS\u202f7.2.1 or newer, by disabling the remoting\u2011java\u2011serialization feature, or by removing/locking down the HTTP\u2011invoker deployment.",
