CVE description: CVE‑2017‑12149 is a critical remote‑code‑execution vulnerability that resides in the JBoss Application Server (also shipped with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and JBoss SOA‑Platform). The flaw exists in the HTTP‑invoker component (the servlet exposed under `/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet` or similar URLs). The servlet accepts serialized Java objects without validating the classes that are being deserialized. An attacker who can reach the JBoss HTTP/HTTPS port can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request that contains a malicious Java object (often generated with tools such as ysoserial). When the JBoss server deserializes this object, the attacker‑controlled code is executed with the privileges of the JBoss process, resulting in full remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability affects JBoss AS versions up to and including 7.2.0 and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.x (including the SOA‑Platform 5.3 module). The issue can be mitigated by upgrading to JBoss AS 7.2.1 or newer, by disabling the remoting‑java‑serialization feature, or by removing/locking down the HTTP‑invoker deployment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php:5.6‑apache image does not have the build tools and libraries required to compile the mysqli extension, so the docker‑php‑ext‑install command cannot run; to fix it, add an apt‑get update and install the necessary packages (e.g., apt‑get install -y libmariadbclient-dev default‑mysql‑client) before invoking docker-php-ext-install mysqli, and then clean up the apt cache in the same RUN line to keep the image tidy. Also verify that the src directory exists next to the Dockerfile so that the COPY src/ /var/www/html/ instruction succeeds; if the folder is missing, create it or adjust the path accordingly. After these adjustments the image will build successfully and the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP 5.6‑Apache image no longer provides the `libmariadbclient-dev` package that `docker-php-ext-install mysqli` expects; replace it with the current MySQL development package (for example `default-libmysqlclient-dev` or `libmysqlclient-dev`), then run the extension install and clean the apt cache. In practice you would edit the Dockerfile’s `RUN` line to something like `apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, which satisfies the build dependencies and lets the image compile successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the php:5.6‑apache image you reference has been removed from the public Docker Hub, so the Docker daemon can’t find a matching layer; replace it with a still‑supported tag such as php:5.6‑apache‑buster (or another variant that still provides PHP 5.6) and then reinstall the MySQL client libraries and the mysqli extension as before. After changing the first line of Dockerfile to FROM php:5.6‑apache‑buster (and, if needed, adding any missing Debian packages for the extension), the image will pull correctly and the rest of the Docker‑Compose stack can be built without errors.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the php:5.6‑apache‑buster image no longer provides the older PHP 5.6 packages and the “default‑libmysqlclient‑dev” package isn’t available in Buster, so the apt‑get step aborts; simply switch the base image to a release that still ships PHP 5.6 (for example php:5.6‑apache‑stretch or the un‑tagged php:5.6‑apache) and adjust the package list to use names that exist in that distro (e.g., default‑mysql‑client and default‑libmysqlclient‑dev or the explicit libmysqlclient-dev package). After changing the FROM line and ensuring the install command references valid packages, the Dockerfile will compile, and the rest of the compose file can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the base image tag `php:5.6‑apache‑stretch` is no longer available in the official registry, so the Dockerfile cannot find a matching layer to pull; switching the FROM line to a still‑supported variant such as `php:5.6-apache` (or to a newer PHP version that still provides the mysqli extension) resolves the lookup error. While you are updating the base, you should also make sure the required packages are installed in a single apt‑get run and that the apt cache is cleared afterwards, for example by replacing the RUN line with a statement that updates the package list, installs `default-mysql-client` and the development headers, runs `docker-php-ext-install mysqli`, and then removes `/var/lib/apt/lists/*`. After these changes the Dockerfile will successfully build, the compose file will start the containers, and the application will run on port 8080 as intended.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the php:5.6‑apache‑buster image no longer provides the packages you request – the legacy PHP 5.6 series is built on older Debian releases and the “default‑libmysqlclient‑dev” package has been removed from Buster’s repositories. Switch the base image to a tag that still ships PHP 5.6 on a supported Debian release (for example php:5.6‑apache‑stretch or php:5.6‑apache‑bullseye), then adjust the apt‑get line to install only the packages that exist in that distribution (e.g., replace default‑libmysqlclient‑dev with libmariadbclient-dev or the generic libmysqlclient-dev, and add any required build‑essential tools). After updating the FROM line and the package list, the Dockerfile will run to completion.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `php:5.6‑apache‑stretch` image no longer has the `default‑mysql‑client` and `default‑libmysqlclient‑dev` packages in its Debian Stretch repository, so the `apt‑get install` step cannot resolve them; to fix it, switch the base image to a supported variant (for example `php:5.6‑apache‑buster` or `php:5.6‑apache‑bullseye`), then install the appropriate MySQL client libraries (`default-mysql-client` and `default-libmysqlclient-dev` are available on newer Debian releases) before running `docker-php-ext-install mysqli`, and finally clean the apt cache as you already do. If you need to stay on Stretch, add the Debian archive repository to `/etc/apt/sources.list` so the missing packages can be found, but the simpler and more future‑proof solution is to use a newer base image that still supports PHP 5.6 and the required extensions. Once the base image is updated and the package names resolve, the Dockerfile will build without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP 5.6‑apache‑bullseye image does not contain the compilation tools needed for docker‑php‑ext‑install, so the mysqli extension cannot be compiled. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to install the required build packages (such as build‑essential, autoconf, php5‑dev or the generic php‑dev metapackage) before invoking docker-php-ext-install, then clean up the extra packages after the extension is built. For example, add a line that runs apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential default-mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev php-dev && docker-php-ext-install mysqli && apt-get purge -y --auto-remove build-essential php-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* so the image can compile the extension and finish building successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the image tag `php:5.6‑apache‑buster` does not exist – PHP 5.6 was never packaged for Debian buster, so apt cannot resolve the base layers or the MySQL client packages you try to install. Change the FROM line to a valid PHP 5.6 tag such as `php:5.6‑apache‑stretch` (or simply `php:5.6‑apache`, which defaults to the supported Debian release) and keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged; this gives you a working base image, lets apt update and install the MySQL client, and the subsequent `docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli` step will succeed, allowing the image to build without errors.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
