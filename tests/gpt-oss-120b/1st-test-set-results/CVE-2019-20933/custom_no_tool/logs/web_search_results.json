    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u201120933 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in InfluxDB versions prior to 1.7.6. The flaw resides in the HTTP service implementation (services/httpd/handler.go) where the authentication routine accepts a JSON Web Token whose SharedSecret field is empty. An empty shared secret disables signature verification, allowing any client to present a crafted JWT that the server treats as valid. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can call the InfluxDB HTTP API, execute arbitrary InfluxQL queries, read and write any database, and obtain administrative privileges. The vulnerability gives full compromise of the InfluxDB instance and may enable further pivoting to services that trust the database.",
