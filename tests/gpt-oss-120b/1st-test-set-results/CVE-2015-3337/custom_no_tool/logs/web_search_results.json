    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20113337 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in Elasticsearch that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the host filesystem. The flaw exists in any Elasticsearch version that includes a site plugin (such as the elasticsearch\u2011head plugin) and does not properly sanitize the path parameter passed to the plugin\u2019s static\u2011file handler. By sending a request to `/_plugin/<plugin>/../../../.../<target\u2011file>` the server resolves the path outside the plugin directory and returns the file contents over HTTP. The vulnerability affects all Elasticsearch releases prior to 1.4.5 and all 1.5.x releases prior to 1.5.2. Exploitation results in confidential data disclosure, exposing system files, configuration files, private keys, and other sensitive information.",
