    "desc": "Fastjson is a Java JSON library that, in versions up to 1.2.24, allows the special '@type' attribute to specify an arbitrary class to be instantiated during deserialization. When a vulnerable application uses Fastjson to parse untrusted JSON data with the default auto\u2011type feature enabled, an attacker can supply a payload such as a com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl object whose dataSourceName points to a malicious RMI reference. Fastjson will perform the JNDI lookup, load the attacker\u2011controlled class, and the static initializer of that class is executed, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the server. This flaw is identified as CVE\u20112017\u201118349 and enables remote code execution without authentication.",
