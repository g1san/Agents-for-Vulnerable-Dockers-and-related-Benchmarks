----------------------------------------


CVE description: Apache HugeGraph Server is a graph database server that exposes an HTTP API (default port 8080) and a Gremlin traversal interface. Versions from 1.0.0 up to, but not including, 1.3.0 contain a critical flaw where user‑supplied Groovy scripts or Gremlin traversals are evaluated without proper sanitisation or authentication. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a request that injects arbitrary Groovy code, which the server executes inside the JVM and subsequently runs operating‑system commands with the privileges of the HugeGraph process. This results in full remote command execution on the host running the service. The vulnerability is present when the server runs on Java 8 or Java 11. Exploitation only requires network access to the HugeGraph HTTP endpoint; no additional services are needed. Mitigation requires upgrading to HugeGraph Server version 1.3.0 or later, running on Java 11, and enabling the built‑in authentication system.
Attack Type: remote command execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][hugegraph/hugegraph-server][['1.0.0', '1.0.1', '1.1.0', '1.1.1', '1.2.0', '1.2.1']] The vulnerable Apache HugeGraph Server component that contains the remote command execution flaw.
- [SOFT-BASE][openjdk][['11-jre']] Java runtime required to run the HugeGraph Server image.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file only defines services 'web' (built from a Python 3.11-slim base) and 'redis' (image redis:7.0.4). Neither hugegraph/hugegraph-server nor openjdk are used, so the required services list is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, no hugegraph/hugegraph-server image is present, therefore no vulnerable version from the specified list (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.2.0, 1.2.1) is used, causing the code_hard_version check to fail (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The compose file only defines services 'web' (built from a Python 3.11-slim base) and 'redis' (image redis:7.0.4). Neither hugegraph/hugegraph-server nor openjdk are used, so the required services list is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, no hugegraph/hugegraph-server image is present, therefore no vulnerable version from the specified list (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.2.0, 1.2.1) is used, causing the code_hard_version check to fail (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the required hard dependency you should add a HugeGraph service to the compose file, pulling an image such as hugegraph/hugegraph-server:1.3.0 (or newer) and configure it to run on Java 11, then update the `services_ok` condition accordingly. At the same time, replace the unsafe pickle‑based storage in app.py with a safe serialization format (for example JSON) and validate any input before writing it to Redis, thereby eliminating the CVE‑2024‑27348 exploit surface. Finally, ensure the environment variables point to the new HugeGraph container if the application needs to interact with it, or remove the dependency entirely if it isn’t required.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the health‑check for the **hugegraph** service tries to run `curl`, but the official hugegraph‑server image does not include the curl binary, so the container immediately reports a failing health‑check and Docker‑Compose aborts the startup sequence. The quickest fix is to replace that health‑check with a command that is guaranteed to exist inside the image (for example the built‑in `nc`/`netcat` utility or a simple `wget` call) or to remove the health‑check entirely if you don’t need it. Edit the `docker‑compose.yml` so the `hugegraph` service’s health‑check looks like one of the following:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "nc -z localhost 8080 || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 5
```

or

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "wget -qO- http://localhost:8080 || exit 1"]
```

or simply delete the whole `healthcheck` block. After removing the unavailable `curl` call the compose file loads, the HugeGraph container starts, and the rest of the stack (the Flask app and Redis) builds and runs without further changes.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Python base image is very minimal and the pip version it ships with can’t reliably install the listed wheels; adding an explicit upgrade of pip before installing the requirements resolves the issue. In the Dockerfile, insert a line such as `RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no‑cache‑dir -r requirements.txt` right after copying the requirements file, and keep the rest of the file unchanged; this ensures the dependency installation succeeds and the image can be built.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the web image is trying to install the Python dependencies on the ultra‑minimal python:3.11‑slim base, which does not contain the system libraries needed by the packages (for example the “redis” client pulls in `cffi`‑based optional extensions that require a C compiler and the standard build tools). To fix it, change the Dockerfile to use a fuller Debian‑based variant (e.g. python:3.11‑slim‑bullseye or python:3.11) and install the required build utilities before running pip — for instance add a RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y build-essential && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* line before the pip install step. After the dependencies are compiled, you can optionally remove the build tools to keep the image small. This adjustment resolves the compilation error and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Python `redis` client tries to compile its optional C extension (hiredis) but the required development headers aren’t present in the image; after the `apt‑get update` you install only `build-essential`, then immediately purge it before the `pip install` step, so the compiler and headers disappear before the wheel can be built. To fix it, keep the build tools long enough to compile the extension (or skip the compiled variant) and add the hiredis development package; for example, install `libhiredis-dev` (or simply omit the purge line) before running `pip install`, then clean up after the installation. This ensures the `redis` wheel can be built and the image finishes building successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state, but its healthcheck is failing. The health status is "starting" with a failing streak of 1 and the health log shows "sh: 1: nc: not found" because the netcat (nc) binary is missing. As a result the container has not become healthy, so it is not considered running correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state, but its healthcheck is failing. The health status is "starting" with a failing streak of 1 and the health log shows "sh: 1: nc: not found" because the netcat (nc) binary is missing. As a result the container has not become healthy, so it is not considered running correctly.
	- FIX: Add the netcat package to the HugeGraph image so the health‑check command can run. Edit dockers/CVE-2024-27348/custom_no_tool/hugegraph/Dockerfile to install netcat (or a compatible client) during the build, for example by inserting `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` after the base image line. This provides the `nc` binary required by the healthcheck, allowing the container to transition to a healthy state. (Alternatively, replace the healthcheck with a command that uses `curl` or `wget`, but installing netcat is the simplest fix.)


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Container state shows it is running, but the health check is failing (status: starting, failing streak: 1, latest health log exit code 1). The healthcheck command (nc -z localhost 8080) returns non‑zero because no service is listening on port 8080, indicating the container is not healthy.
	- ERROR: Container state shows it is running, but the health check is failing (status: starting, failing streak: 1, latest health log exit code 1). The healthcheck command (nc -z localhost 8080) returns non‑zero because no service is listening on port 8080, indicating the container is not healthy.
	- FIX: The failure occurs because the hugegraph container never starts the actual HugeGraph server – its CMD only sleeps forever, so nothing is listening on port 8080 and the health‑check always fails. To fix this, replace the dummy sleep command with the proper startup of HugeGraph (for example, adding the HugeGraph binaries to the image, installing any required dependencies, and setting CMD to run the server’s launch script such as bin/hugegraph‑server or the appropriate entrypoint provided by the official HugeGraph image). Once the server process is launched, it will bind to 0.0.0.0:8080 and the health‑check “nc -z localhost 8080” will succeed, bringing the container to a healthy state.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Python Redis client tries to compile the optional hiredis C extension, and the `libhiredis-dev` package isn’t available (or the compiler is removed) on the Bullseye base image; you can fix it by simplifying the Dockerfile so it only installs the runtime dependencies needed for the pure‑Python client. Change the Dockerfile to run `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --no-install-recommends ca‑certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` (or remove the whole `apt‑get install` line) before the `pip install`, then drop the `build-essential` and `libhiredis-dev` packages and the subsequent purge step. With no compiled extension required, `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds and the image builds correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the malformed RUN line in the app Dockerfile – the line break after the `apt‑get` command breaks the shell syntax, so the subsequent `&& pip …` part is never reached. Fix it by putting the entire install sequence on a single `RUN` line (or using proper back‑slashes for continuation), for example: `RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --no‑install‑recommends ca‑certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no‑cache‑dir -r requirements.txt`. After correcting the Dockerfile syntax the image will build successfully.
