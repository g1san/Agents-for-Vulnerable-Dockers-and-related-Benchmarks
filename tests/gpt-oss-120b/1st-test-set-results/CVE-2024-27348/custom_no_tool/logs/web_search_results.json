    "desc": "Apache HugeGraph Server is a graph database server that exposes an HTTP API (default port 8080) and a Gremlin traversal interface. Versions from 1.0.0 up to, but not including, 1.3.0 contain a critical flaw where user\u2011supplied Groovy scripts or Gremlin traversals are evaluated without proper sanitisation or authentication. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a request that injects arbitrary Groovy code, which the server executes inside the JVM and subsequently runs operating\u2011system commands with the privileges of the HugeGraph process. This results in full remote command execution on the host running the service. The vulnerability is present when the server runs on Java\u202f8 or Java\u202f11. Exploitation only requires network access to the HugeGraph HTTP endpoint; no additional services are needed. Mitigation requires upgrading to HugeGraph Server version 1.3.0 or later, running on Java\u202f11, and enabling the built\u2011in authentication system.",
