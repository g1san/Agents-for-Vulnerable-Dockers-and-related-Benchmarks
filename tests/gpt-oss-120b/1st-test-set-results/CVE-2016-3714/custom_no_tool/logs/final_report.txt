CVE description: CVE‑2016‑3714 is a remote code execution vulnerability in ImageMagick (commonly referred to as ImageTragick). The flaw resides in several image coders (EPHEMERAL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN and PLT) that invoke external programs via the system call without properly sanitising user‑supplied data. An attacker can embed shell metacharacters inside a crafted image file (for example in SVG, MVG or PLT formats). When the vulnerable ImageMagick library processes the malicious image—whether directly via the `convert`/`identify` utilities or indirectly through language bindings such as the PHP imagick extension—the embedded command is executed in the host operating system context, granting the attacker arbitrary command execution on the server. This works even when the host language disables its own execution functions because the code runs inside the native ImageMagick process.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][imagemagick][['6.9.3-0', '6.9.3-1', '6.9.3-2', '6.9.3-3', '6.9.3-4', '6.9.3-5', '6.9.3-6', '6.9.3-7', '6.9.3-8', '6.9.3-9', '7.0.0-0', '7.0.0-1', '7.0.0-2', '7.0.0-3', '7.0.0-4', '7.0.0-5', '7.0.0-6', '7.0.0-7', '7.0.0-8', '7.0.0-9']] Core ImageMagick library that contains the vulnerable coders; required for the remote code execution flaw to be present.
- [SOFT-WEB][php][['7.4-apache']] Web server runtime that hosts the PHP application using the imagick extension to process uploaded images.
- [SOFT][php-imagick][['3.4.4']] PHP imagick extension that provides the wrapper to ImageMagick; needed to reproduce the vulnerable processing path.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image is based on node:8 and only installs Node.js and its dependencies. There is no installation or usage of imagemagick, php, or php-imagick in the Dockerfile, package.json, or server.js. Consequently, the image does not contain any of the required services, and it does not use any of the listed vulnerable imagemagick versions.
	- ERROR: The Docker image is based on node:8 and only installs Node.js and its dependencies. There is no installation or usage of imagemagick, php, or php-imagick in the Dockerfile, package.json, or server.js. Consequently, the image does not contain any of the required services, and it does not use any of the listed vulnerable imagemagick versions.
	- FIX: To fix the vulnerability, remove the direct use of exec on user‑controlled data and replace it with a safe, explicitly‑defined operation; if external commands are truly needed, validate the cmd parameter against a whitelist of allowed values or use a library that safely spawns processes without a shell. In the minimal case, simply delete the exec call and return a static response or implement the required functionality in pure JavaScript, ensuring that no unchecked input is ever passed to the operating system. This eliminates the remote‑code‑execution risk without needing any ImageMagick‑related changes.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfiles request a non‑existent package version with `imagemagick=8.*`; the vulnerable ImageMagick 6.9.x series is what you need, so replace the version spec with `imagemagick=6.9*` (or simply omit the version pin and let the distro provide the 6.9 packages). In the PHP image you also have to install the development headers before running `pecl install imagick`, so add `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends php-dev autoconf build-essential` (or use the `docker-php-ext-install` helper) before the pecl step, and make sure `libmagickwand-dev` matches the ImageMagick version you installed. After adjusting the package names and ensuring the required build tools are present, the images should compile without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the PHP image is missing a few development tools required to compile the imagick extension – most notably pkg‑config (and its related libraries) – so the pecl install step aborts; to fix it you simply extend the apt‑get install line in the PHP Dockerfile to include pkg‑config (and, for newer ImageMagick versions, libmagickcore-dev or libmagickwand-dev if not already present), then rebuild the image, and the Node image will build fine unchanged. If the error is instead a path issue, ensure that the docker‑compose.yml file’s build: ./app and build: ./php contexts point to the directories that actually contain the Dockerfiles (they must be relative to the compose file’s location), correcting any mismatched folder names will also resolve the failure.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑based image tries to compile the imagick extension before the required MagickWand development libraries are fully available, and the extra `php‑dev` and build tools are left in the image causing conflicts with the pre‑installed PHP runtime. Fix it by simplifying the PHP Dockerfile: first install only the MagickWand and core development packages (`imagemagick libmagickwand-dev libmagickcore-dev`), then run `pecl install imagick && docker-php-ext-enable imagick` and finally clean up the apt cache, removing the unnecessary `php-dev`, `autoconf`, `build-essential` and `pkg-config` steps. This ensures the imagick extension compiles against the correct libraries and the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP image tries to compile the imagick PECL extension without the compiler and related tools that are required for building native extensions. To fix it, add the development packages (such as build‑essential, pkg‑config and git) to the apt‑get line before running pecl install imagick, then keep the rest of the steps the same; after the extension is compiled you can optionally remove those build packages to keep the image small. With the compiler present the imagick PECL module will compile successfully and the Docker build will complete.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the PHP‑Imagick extension is being compiled from source without all the required development packages (php‑pear, autoconf, and the libmagick* headers) and then the build tools are removed before the extension is actually enabled. The quickest fix is to stop compiling via pecl and instead install the pre‑built Debian package, which pulls in the correct dependencies automatically; replace the “pecl install imagick && docker-php-ext-enable imagick” line with a simple “apt‑get install -y php-imagick && docker‑php-ext-enable imagick”, and remove the purge of php‑dev, build‑essential, pkg‑config and git (or move the purge to after the extension is enabled). This ensures the imagick module loads correctly and the image builds without error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `php-imagick` package isn’t available in the default Debian repositories used by the `php:7.4‑apache` image, so the `apt‑get install php-imagick` step aborts. Replace that line with a compilation‑based installation: first install the MagickWand development libraries (`libmagickwand-dev` and any other required `libmagickcore-dev` packages), then use PECL to build the extension and enable it. In the Dockerfile you can drop `php-imagick` from the apt list and add the commands `pecl install imagick && docker-php-ext-enable imagick` after the development libs are installed; keep the `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --no-install-recommends imagemagick libmagickwand-dev libmagickcore-dev` line, clean the apt cache, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image that fails to build is the PHP one – the `pecl install imagick` step aborts because the required ImageMagick development headers aren’t present (or the wrong package name is used), so the extension can’t compile. Fix it by installing the correct development libraries **before** invoking PECL and by cleaning up the layer afterwards. In practice you only need to add the `libmagickwand-6.q16-dev` (or the equivalent `libmagickwand-dev` for the distro you’re using) package, then run `pecl install imagick` and enable the extension. A minimal change looks like this: replace the current `RUN` line in `php/Dockerfile` with a single `RUN` that updates the package index, installs `imagemagick`, `libmagickwand-6.q16-dev`, `libmagickcore-dev`, `php-pear`, `build-essential` and `pkg-config`, runs `pecl install imagick`, enables it with `docker-php-ext-enable imagick`, and finally removes the apt cache. After that the build proceeds without error. The Node service already builds fine, so no changes are needed there.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfiles install ImageMagick from the default Debian Bullseye repositories (both in the Node and PHP images). The package version in Bullseye is 6.9.10.x (or later), which is not among the allowed versions list ['6.9.3-0'…'6.9.3-9','7.0.0-0'…'7.0.0-9']. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The required services (imagemagick, php, php-imagick) are present, so 'services_ok' is true.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfiles install ImageMagick from the default Debian Bullseye repositories (both in the Node and PHP images). The package version in Bullseye is 6.9.10.x (or later), which is not among the allowed versions list ['6.9.3-0'…'6.9.3-9','7.0.0-0'…'7.0.0-9']. Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. The required services (imagemagick, php, php-imagick) are present, so 'services_ok' is true.
	- FIX: To meet the code_hard_version milestone you need to replace the generic “apt‑get install -y imagemagick” with an installation that pins the package to one of the allowed versions (for example 6.9.3‑0 or 7.0.0‑0). In the Node Dockerfile you can add a line such as apt‑get install -y imagemagick=6.9.3-0 after configuring the apt sources to include the exact version (or by using a Debian snapshot repository that still carries those releases). Do the same in the PHP Dockerfile, ensuring the development headers match the same version, and run pecl install imagick against that library. By explicitly specifying the package version (or building ImageMagick from source at the required version) the containers will contain an ImageMagick build that satisfies the allowed version list while keeping the rest of the setup unchanged.
