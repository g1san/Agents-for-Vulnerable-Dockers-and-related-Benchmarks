    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20113714 is a remote code execution vulnerability in ImageMagick (commonly referred to as ImageTragick). The flaw resides in several image coders (EPHEMERAL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN and PLT) that invoke external programs via the system call without properly sanitising user\u2011supplied data. An attacker can embed shell metacharacters inside a crafted image file (for example in SVG, MVG or PLT formats). When the vulnerable ImageMagick library processes the malicious image\u2014whether directly via the `convert`/`identify` utilities or indirectly through language bindings such as the PHP imagick extension\u2014the embedded command is executed in the host operating system context, granting the attacker arbitrary command execution on the server. This works even when the host language disables its own execution functions because the code runs inside the native ImageMagick process.",
