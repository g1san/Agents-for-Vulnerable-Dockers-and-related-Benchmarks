    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201122515 is a critical broken\u2011access\u2011control vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center versions 8.0.0 through 8.5.1. The flaw allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access hidden /setup/* endpoints (for example /setup/setupadministrator.action) and create or promote a user to the confluence\u2011administrator group. This results in full administrative control of the Confluence instance, enabling data theft, credential extraction, malicious plugin installation, and further network pivoting. The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0 (critical).",
