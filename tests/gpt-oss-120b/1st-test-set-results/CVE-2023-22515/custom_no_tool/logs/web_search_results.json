    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201122515 is a critical broken access control vulnerability affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center versions 8.0.0 through 8.5.1. The flaw resides in the publicly exposed /setup/* endpoints, which can be accessed without any authentication. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to these endpoints (for example /setup/setupadministrator.action) that cause Confluence to create a new user account and place it in the confluence\u2011administrators group. This grants the attacker full administrative rights over the Confluence instance, allowing unrestricted access to all data, the ability to install malicious plugins, and complete control of the application. The vulnerability is classified as Critical with a CVSS score of 10.0. It is exploitable over the network with no credentials required and affects on\u2011premise deployments only; Atlassian Cloud is not vulnerable. Fixed versions are 8.3.3, 8.4.3, 8.5.2 LTS, and any later release.",
