CVE description: CVE‑2023‑22515 is a critical broken‑access‑control vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center versions 8.0.0 through 8.5.1. The flaw allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access hidden /setup/* endpoints (for example /setup/setupadministrator.action) and create or promote a user to the confluence‑administrator group. This results in full administrative control of the Confluence instance, enabling data theft, credential extraction, malicious plugin installation, and further network pivoting. The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 10.0 (critical).
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote privilege escalation via broken access control
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][atlassian/confluence][['8.0.0', '8.0.1', '8.0.2', '8.0.3', '8.0.4', '8.0.5', '8.0.6', '8.0.7', '8.0.8', '8.0.9', '8.1.0', '8.1.1', '8.1.2', '8.1.3', '8.1.4', '8.1.5', '8.1.6', '8.1.7', '8.1.8', '8.1.9', '8.2.0', '8.2.1', '8.2.2', '8.2.3', '8.2.4', '8.2.5', '8.2.6', '8.2.7', '8.2.8', '8.2.9', '8.3.0', '8.3.1', '8.3.2', '8.4.0', '8.4.1', '8.4.2', '8.5.0', '8.5.1']] Core Confluence application that contains the vulnerable /setup/* endpoints. Running any of the listed versions makes the Docker environment vulnerable to CVE‑2023‑22515.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13.12']] External PostgreSQL database required by Confluence for storing its data. A supported version such as 13.12 works with all vulnerable Confluence images.

This is the first version of the generated code:

	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker Compose file only defines a 'portainer' service based on the image portainer/portainer-ce:2.16.2. It does not reference the atlassian/confluence image, so none of the listed vulnerable Confluence versions are used, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false. Additionally, the required services list ['atlassian/confluence', 'postgres'] is not present in the compose configuration; there is no confluence or postgres service defined, resulting in the 'services_ok' milestone being false.
	- ERROR: The Docker Compose file only defines a 'portainer' service based on the image portainer/portainer-ce:2.16.2. It does not reference the atlassian/confluence image, so none of the listed vulnerable Confluence versions are used, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to be false. Additionally, the required services list ['atlassian/confluence', 'postgres'] is not present in the compose configuration; there is no confluence or postgres service defined, resulting in the 'services_ok' milestone being false.
	- FIX: To resolve the failures you need to add the missing services and reference a safe Confluence image. First, insert a postgres service that uses the supported postgres:13.12 image, expose the required port, and create a persistent volume for its data. Next, add a confluence service that pulls a non‑vulnerable version of the atlassian/confluence image (for example 8.5.2 or later), configure it to depend on the postgres service, mount a volume for the Confluence home directory, and set the required environment variables (such as ATL_JDBC_URL, ATL_JDBC_USER, ATL_JDBC_PASSWORD). Finally, keep the existing portainer service unchanged or remove it if it is not needed, and update the top‑level volumes section to include any new named volumes you created for Postgres and Confluence. This brings the compose file into alignment with the required service list and eliminates the false code_hard_version and services_ok milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Confluence service fails to start in this compose file is that the image tag `atlassian/confluence:8.5.2` does not match any of the vulnerable versions listed for CVE‑2023‑22515, so the container may be pulling a newer image that expects a different data directory layout or additional configuration. Change the image to a version that is known to work with the supplied volume and database, for example `atlassian/confluence:8.5.1`, and then run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate confluence` so the service restarts with the corrected image. If the container still does not come up, verify that the PostgreSQL service is healthy before Confluence starts (add a healthcheck or increase the `depends_on` condition) and ensure the `init‑postgres.sql` file is readable inside the postgres container (the `:ro` flag is fine) so the database schema is created correctly. After these adjustments the three containers should all launch without errors.
