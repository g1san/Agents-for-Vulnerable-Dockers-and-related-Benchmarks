    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201126031 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the native `container-executor` binary that is used by Apache Hadoop YARN Secure Containers on Linux. A change introduced in YARN\u201110495 altered the binary\u2019s library run\u2011path from `$ORIGIN/` to `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. This added a relative path that points to a directory where an unprivileged user can write a malicious `libcrypto.so`. Because `container\u2011executor` is owned by root and has the set\u2011uid bit set, the binary loads the attacker\u2011controlled library and executes its code with root privileges. The vulnerability affects Hadoop versions 3.3.1 through 3.3.4. It is fixed in Hadoop 3.3.5, where the run\u2011path is reverted to `$ORIGIN/` only.",
