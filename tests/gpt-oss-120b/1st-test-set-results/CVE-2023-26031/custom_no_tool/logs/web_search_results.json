    "desc": "CVE-2023-26031 is a privilege\u2011escalation vulnerability in the Apache Hadoop YARN component. The native `container-executor` binary, which is required to run YARN secure containers, is shipped as a set\u2011uid root executable. In Hadoop versions 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 the binary\u2019s run\u2011path was changed to include the relative directory `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. This directory can be made writable by an unprivileged user, allowing the attacker to place a malicious shared library (for example a crafted `libcrypto.so`). When YARN invokes `container-executor`, the set\u2011uid binary loads the attacker\u2011controlled library and executes its code with root privileges, giving the attacker full root access on the Hadoop node. The flaw is fixed in Hadoop 3.3.5, which reverts the run\u2011path change.",
