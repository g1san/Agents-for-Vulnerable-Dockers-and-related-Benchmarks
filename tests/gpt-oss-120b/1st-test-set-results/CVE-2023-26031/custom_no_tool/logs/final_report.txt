CVE description: CVE-2023-26031 is a privilege‑escalation vulnerability in the Apache Hadoop YARN component. The native `container-executor` binary, which is required to run YARN secure containers, is shipped as a set‑uid root executable. In Hadoop versions 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 the binary’s run‑path was changed to include the relative directory `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. This directory can be made writable by an unprivileged user, allowing the attacker to place a malicious shared library (for example a crafted `libcrypto.so`). When YARN invokes `container-executor`, the set‑uid binary loads the attacker‑controlled library and executes its code with root privileges, giving the attacker full root access on the Hadoop node. The flaw is fixed in Hadoop 3.3.5, which reverts the run‑path change.
Attack Type: privilege escalation
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/hadoop][['3.3.1', '3.3.2', '3.3.3', '3.3.4']] Provides the Hadoop YARN services and the vulnerable `container-executor` binary. This service is essential for reproducing the vulnerability because the exploit targets the YARN container‑executor binary shipped with these Hadoop versions.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile runs `npm ci --only=production`, which aborts when a `package-lock.json` is not present in the `app` directory; add a lock file (run `npm i --package-lock` locally and commit the generated `package-lock.json`) or replace the command with a plain `npm install --only=production`. If the `pg` module still crashes during the build, extend the image with the Alpine build tools (`apk add --no‑cache python3 make g++`) before running npm and remove them afterwards to keep the image lightweight. After these adjustments the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not include the apache/hadoop service; only node:14-alpine and postgres:13-alpine images are used, so neither the required service nor the specified vulnerable versions are present.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition does not include the apache/hadoop service; only node:14-alpine and postgres:13-alpine images are used, so neither the required service nor the specified vulnerable versions are present.
	- FIX: Add a service definition for the vulnerable Hadoop YARN component to the compose file, pointing to a Docker image that contains Hadoop 3.3.1‑3.3.4 with the `container-executor` binary (for example, build a custom image from an official Hadoop tarball and install the native libraries). Then update the `depends_on` list of `vulnerable_app` to reference this new `hadoop` service instead of only the database, and expose whatever ports YARN requires (e.g., 8088). Optionally mount a volume for Hadoop’s configuration so the container‑executor can be invoked. This brings the required `apache/hadoop` service into the stack, allowing the exploit scenario to be reproduced.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Hadoop image is trying to use files and permissions that aren’t present in the Alpine‑based OpenJDK image – the `container‑executor` binary is not shipped in `$HADOOP_HOME/bin`, the entry‑point script isn’t marked executable, and the Alpine image is missing a few utilities required to unpack Hadoop correctly. Fix the problem by (1) changing the base image to one that provides the GNU C library (e.g. `eclipse-temurin:8-jre` or `openjdk:8-jdk` on Debian) so the Hadoop binaries can run, (2) installing `tar` and `gzip` before the download step, (3) adding a `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh` line after copying the script, and (4) correcting the `container‑executor` path – after extracting Hadoop the binary lives under `$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/container-executor`, so the `chmod u+s` command should point there (and you can ignore the failure with `|| true`). After those changes the Dockerfile will build successfully and the compose stack will start.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Node‑app Dockerfile tries to remove a non‑existent package – the line `apk del python3 make g+` contains a typo; the correct Alpine package name is **g++**, so change it to `apk del python3 make g++`. After correcting that typo the image will compile successfully. If you also want the Node app to start without a runtime error, add the PostgreSQL credentials as environment variables in its service definition (for example `- POSTGRES_USER=testuser`, `- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpass`, `- POSTGRES_DB=testdb`) so the `pg` client can connect to the database. These two simple edits resolve the build‑time failure and let the stack start as intended.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
