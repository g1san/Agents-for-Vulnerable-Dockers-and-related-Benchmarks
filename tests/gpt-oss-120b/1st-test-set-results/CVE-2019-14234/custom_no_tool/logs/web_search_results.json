{
    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u201114234 is a vulnerability in the Django web framework that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL into queries generated for the JSONField and HStoreField. The flaw occurs because Django concatenates the lookup key supplied by the user directly into the SQL statement without proper escaping. When a malicious key (for example \"detail__a' OR 1=1--\") is supplied through a view that forwards request parameters to QuerySet.filter(), the resulting SQL can be manipulated to return all rows or execute additional statements. The vulnerability is present in Django versions 1.11.x up to 1.11.22, 2.1.x up to 2.1.10, and 2.2.x up to 2.2.3. It can be exploited by any user who can reach a Django view (including the default Django\u2011Admin list view) that passes unchecked request data to the ORM, allowing unauthenticated remote SQL injection against the underlying PostgreSQL database.",
