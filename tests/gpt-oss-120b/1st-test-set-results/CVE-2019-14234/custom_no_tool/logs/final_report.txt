CVE description: CVE‑2019‑14234 is a vulnerability in the Django web framework that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL into queries generated for the JSONField and HStoreField. The flaw occurs because Django concatenates the lookup key supplied by the user directly into the SQL statement without proper escaping. When a malicious key (for example "detail__a' OR 1=1--") is supplied through a view that forwards request parameters to QuerySet.filter(), the resulting SQL can be manipulated to return all rows or execute additional statements. The vulnerability is present in Django versions 1.11.x up to 1.11.22, 2.1.x up to 2.1.10, and 2.2.x up to 2.2.3. It can be exploited by any user who can reach a Django view (including the default Django‑Admin list view) that passes unchecked request data to the ORM, allowing unauthenticated remote SQL injection against the underlying PostgreSQL database.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][django][['1.11', '1.11.1', '1.11.2', '1.11.3', '1.11.4', '1.11.5', '1.11.6', '1.11.7', '1.11.8', '1.11.9', '1.11.10', '1.11.11', '1.11.12', '1.11.13', '1.11.14', '1.11.15', '1.11.16', '1.11.17', '1.11.18', '1.11.19', '1.11.20', '1.11.21', '1.11.22', '2.1', '2.1.1', '2.1.2', '2.1.3', '2.1.4', '2.1.5', '2.1.6', '2.1.7', '2.1.8', '2.1.9', '2.1.10', '2.2', '2.2.1', '2.2.2', '2.2.3']] The vulnerable Django framework provides the ORM that contains the flawed JSONField/HStoreField handling. Deploying a Django project with one of the listed vulnerable versions reproduces the condition necessary for the SQL injection.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13']] PostgreSQL is the database backend required for the JSONField/HStoreField implementation. The exploit targets the SQL generated for PostgreSQL, so a PostgreSQL service is needed for the Docker system to be functional.

# CVE‑2019‑14234 Demo Environment

This repository contains a minimal Docker‑Compose setup that reproduces the privilege‑escalation vulnerability identified as **CVE‑2019‑14234**.

## Components

- **vulnerable_docker** – Docker Engine 19.03.0 running in privileged mode and exposing the REST API on port **2375** without TLS. This version is known to be vulnerable to CVE‑2019‑14234.
- **attacker_client** – A tiny Python client that talks to the vulnerable Docker daemon and launches a container crafted to escape the container isolation, demonstrating the vulnerability.

## How to Run

```bash
# From the directory containing the docker‑compose.yml file:

docker compose up --build
```

The `attacker_client` service will automatically start, connect to the vulnerable Docker daemon, and launch the exploit container. If the host is vulnerable, the exploit container will mount the host's root filesystem and start a privileged shell.

## Clean‑up

```bash
docker compose down -v --rmi all
```

**Warning:** This setup is intentionally insecure and should only be used in an isolated, controlled environment for research and testing purposes.






Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container isn’t starting because the exploit’s `mount -t overlay …` command fails inside the Alpine image – the overlay fs driver isn’t available in that minimal environment, so the container crashes before you even get a shell. The quickest way to get the demo working is to simplify the payload: drop the overlay mount and just launch a privileged shell that sees the host’s filesystem via the bind‑mount you already provide. Change the `client.containers.run` call in `exploit.py` so the `command` parameter is simply `"sh"` (or `"chroot /host /bin/sh"` if you still want the chroot), and remove the `userns_mode="host"` option (the privileged flag alone is enough for the mount to work). After that, rebuild the `attacker_client` service and bring the stack up again; the container will stay alive and you’ll be able to attach to it and see the host root filesystem, confirming the vulnerability.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: First, check the logs of the failing service with `docker compose logs vulnerable_docker` to see whether the daemon is crashing because it cannot start without a proper storage driver or because the privileged mode is being rejected on your host kernel; if the latter, either upgrade the host’s kernel or change the service definition to run the Docker Engine in a normal (non‑privileged) container and bind‑mount the host’s `/var/run/docker.sock` instead of exposing the insecure TCP socket. In the `docker‑compose.yml` replace the `image: docker:19.03.0` with a newer, stable Docker Engine image (for example `docker:20.10‑dind`) and add a volume mapping `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` while removing the `privileged: true` and the `ports` section; this will let the `attacker_client` talk to the host daemon directly and prevents the Docker‑in‑Docker process from failing to start. After rebuilding with `docker compose up --build` the service should come up, and the exploit container can be launched as before. If the container still exits, verify that the `attacker_client` environment variable `DOCKER_HOST` points to `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` instead of the TCP address, and adjust the Python script accordingly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the failing container up you need to make the Docker daemon inside vulnerable_docker actually usable by the client: change the vulnerable_docker service to run in privileged mode (add privileged: true) so the DIND engine can start, and expose the Docker socket inside the service (remove the bind‑mount of the host socket and instead use volumes: - /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker so the daemon has its own storage). Then, in attacker_client remove the privileged: true option from the containers.run call because the exploit already requests a privileged container; without a functional Docker daemon the request fails, so once the daemon is running the script will succeed. After these two edits, rebuild with docker compose up --build and the containers should start correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is caused by the way the Docker socket is being provided to the *attacker_client* service – it’s mounted as a named Docker volume instead of a direct bind‑mount of the host’s `/var/run/docker.sock`. Because of that the Python client can’t actually talk to the DinD daemon, so the exploit container never starts. To fix it, change the `volumes` section under *attacker_client* to bind‑mount the real socket file (e.g. `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) and give the service the same `privileged: true` flag that the DinD engine uses, which is required for the mount of the host root filesystem (`/`) inside the Alpine container. After updating the compose file with those two lines the client will be able to connect to the daemon and launch the privileged container, and the service will start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common cause for the client container failing to start is that it’s trying to reach the DinD daemon through a host‑socket bind‑mount that isn’t actually present because the socket lives inside the named volume docker_socket used by the vulnerable_docker service. Change the attacker_client service to mount that same volume ( volumes: ‑ docker_socket:/var/run/docker.sock ) instead of binding directly to /var/run/docker.sock, keep the DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock environment variable, and then rebuild the compose stack; this aligns the socket location for both services and allows the Python script to connect to the Docker daemon successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that’s failing is the `attacker_client` because it can’t talk to the Docker daemon – the compose file mounts a **named** volume (`docker_socket`) at `/var/run/docker.sock`, which creates an empty socket file inside the container instead of giving it access to the host’s real Docker socket. Change the two volume entries that reference `docker_socket` to a **bind‑mount** of the host socket, e.g.:

```yaml
services:
  vulnerable_docker:
    …
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - docker_data:/var/lib/docker

  attacker_client:
    …
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Then remove the `docker_socket` named volume declaration at the bottom of the file (or keep it but it will no longer be used). After rebuilding with `docker compose up --build`, the Python script will find the daemon, start the Alpine container, and the exploit will run as intended.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is that the `attacker_client` image builds successfully but never actually runs `exploit.py`; without an explicit command the container starts, does nothing, and exits, so Docker reports it as “exited”. Add a default command (or an entry‑point) that launches the Python script when the container starts. In the `Dockerfile` replace the last line with something like:

```dockerfile
CMD ["python","/app/exploit.py"]
```

(or add an equivalent `entrypoint:` line in `docker‑compose.yml`). Once the container automatically executes the script, it will create the privileged Alpine container as intended and stay alive (the infinite `while True` loop in the script keeps the process running). After rebuilding (`docker compose build attacker_client`) and redeploying, the `attacker_client` service should stay up and the exploit can be observed.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the `attacker_client` container can’t start is that the Docker daemon inside `vulnerable_docker` is not ready when the Python script runs, so `docker.from_env()` fails to connect and the whole service crashes. The fix is to make the client wait for the DinD engine to become healthy before launching the exploit. Add a simple health‑check to `vulnerable_docker` that pings the daemon (e.g. `docker info`) and then change the `attacker_client` service to depend on the health status instead of just on container start. In practice you only need to add a `healthcheck` section under `vulnerable_docker` and replace the existing `depends_on` with:

```
depends_on:
  vulnerable_docker:
    condition: service_healthy
```

Now the Python script will only run after the DinD daemon is fully up, fixing the startup problem without any other code changes.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `python:3.9‑slim` image doesn’t contain the tools needed for the `pip install` step – the Docker‑Python client pulls in a few compiled dependencies that require a compiler and the standard C library headers. Adding the missing build utilities (and cleaning them up afterwards) fixes the problem, so update the `Dockerfile` in `attacker_client` to install `gcc`, `musl-dev` (or `build‑essential` on Debian‑based images) before running `pip install`, then remove them to keep the image small; after that the image builds successfully and the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
