# CVE‑2019‑14234 Demo Environment

This repository provides a minimal Docker‑Compose setup that reproduces the privilege‑escalation vulnerability identified as **CVE‑2019‑14234**.

## Components

- **vulnerable_docker** – A Docker‑in‑Docker (DinD) engine (Docker 20.10) running in privileged mode with its own storage. It exposes its Unix socket via a bind‑mount so other services can talk to it.
- **attacker_client** – A tiny Python client that connects to the DinD daemon through the shared socket and launches a container that mounts the host's root filesystem, demonstrating the exploitation path.

## How to Run

```bash
# From the directory containing the docker‑compose.yml file:

docker compose up --build
```

The `attacker_client` service will automatically start, connect to the Docker daemon, and launch the exploit container. If the host system is vulnerable, the exploit container will have access to the host's filesystem and provide a privileged shell.

## Clean‑up

```bash
docker compose down -v --rmi all
```

**Warning:** This setup is intentionally insecure and should only be used in an isolated, controlled environment for research and testing purposes.
