CVE description: CVE‑2020‑13945 is a vulnerability in the Apache APISIX API gateway. The product ships with a hard‑coded default admin token (edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1). When the Admin API IP‑restriction rules are removed or disabled, the default token remains valid and can be used by any remote client. An attacker who knows the token can authenticate to the Admin API, create or modify routes, and inject Lua scripts via the `script` field of a route. The injected Lua code can execute arbitrary operating‑system commands on the host, giving the attacker full remote code execution capabilities with the privileges of the APISIX process. Affected APISIX releases are 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/apisix][['1.2.0', '1.3.0', '1.4.0', '1.5.0']] Vulnerable API gateway containing the default admin token and the Admin API that can be exploited to run arbitrary commands.
- [SOFT-CACHE][bitnami/etcd][['3.5.0']] Key‑value store used by Apache APISIX for configuration persistence; required for APISIX to start.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines two services: 'web' built from a custom Node.js image and 'db' based on the MySQL 5.7 image. Neither apache/apisix nor bitnami/etcd appear in the compose file or in the inspected images, so the required services are absent, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail. Since apache/apisix is not used at all, there is no chance of using one of the vulnerable versions (1.2.0‑1.5.0), so the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails. Hence both boolean flags are false and the explanation details the missing services and version mismatch.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines two services: 'web' built from a custom Node.js image and 'db' based on the MySQL 5.7 image. Neither apache/apisix nor bitnami/etcd appear in the compose file or in the inspected images, so the required services are absent, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail.

Hence both boolean flags are false and the explanation details the missing services and version mismatch.
	- FIX: To satisfy the missing‑service check you need to add an Apache APISIX container (for example apisix/apisix:1.5‑alpine) to the compose file and also run a compatible etcd instance (such as bitnami/etcd:3.5.0) that APISIX can use for its configuration store; declare the etcd service first, expose its client port, and configure the APISIX service with environment variables pointing to the etcd endpoint and with a non‑default admin token. Then update the “code_hard_version” flag by ensuring the APISIX image version you select falls within the vulnerable range (1.2.0‑1.5.0) or, if you prefer to demonstrate the fix, use a patched version above 1.5.0 and remove the default token. Finally, adjust the web service’s depends_on section to include the new APISIX service so the compose startup order is correct.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is likely failing because the Node image you start from is Alpine‑based and does not contain the native‑build tools that some npm packages need, so the npm install step aborts; you can fix it by installing the required Alpine build packages before running npm install (e.g. add RUN apk add --no‑cache python3 make gcc g++ or the build-base meta‑package) and by reordering the COPY commands so that only package.json (and optionally package-lock.json) are copied before the install, then copy the rest of the source afterwards—this guarantees a clean layer, avoids copying host‑side node_modules, and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Node‑image layer tries to install build‑tools that aren’t named correctly for Alpine and the copy of the application source is happening after the npm install, so the package lock (if present) isn’t available. Fix it by correcting the apk line to install the exact Alpine packages (e.g. `apk add --no-cache python3 make g++` is fine, but you can replace `g++` with the meta‑package `build-base` which brings in make and gcc) and by moving the `COPY . .` before the `npm install` so that any lock file is included when Node resolves dependencies. After those two changes the Dockerfile will build without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build failure, I would simplify the Dockerfile by using the non‑Alpine Node image (e.g., node:14‑slim) so the build tools that are only needed for native modules are not required, then copy the package.json and package‑lock.json first, run npm ci to install exact dependencies, and finally copy the source code before starting the container; this ordering avoids unnecessary recompilation steps and eliminates the need for the apk install line that is causing the image‑build error. Additionally, I would verify that the build: ./app path in docker‑compose.yml points to the correct directory relative to the compose file so the Docker daemon can locate the Dockerfile and source files. Once these adjustments are made, the services should build and start without the previous error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the compose file is missing a top‑level `version` declaration and the `environment` blocks are written in a mixed style that some Docker engines don’t parse correctly; fixing those two lines lets the images be built without error. Add a `version: "3.8"` (or any supported version) as the first line of *docker‑compose.yml*, and rewrite each `environment` section so that every entry is either a `KEY=VALUE` string in a list or a plain map – for example, change  

```
environment:
  - ALLOW_NONE_AUTHENTICATION=yes
  - ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:2379
  …
```  

to  

```
environment:
  ALLOW_NONE_AUTHENTICATION: "yes"
  ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS: "http://0.0.0.0:2379"
  …
```  

Do the same for the MySQL service. After those two adjustments, the `docker-compose build` step will succeed and the rest of the stack (etcd, APISIX, MySQL and the Node app) will start normally.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Node 14‑slim base image is no longer provided in the registry, so the Dockerfile cannot pull it; switch the Dockerfile to a currently supported tag such as `node:18-slim` (or any actively maintained LTS version), then run the same `npm install --production` and copy steps. After updating the base image, re‑run `docker compose up --build` and the images should compile without errors. If the problem persists, verify that the path to the app’s Dockerfile (`./app`) is correct relative to the compose file and that any `.dockerignore` isn’t unintentionally excluding required files.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile only copies package.json and then runs npm install ‑ when the image is built the npm resolver can’t find the lock‑file (or any other files it expects) and the install step aborts. The quick fix is to copy the lock‑file (or any other npm configuration files) into the image before running the install, and use the deterministic npm ci command instead of a plain npm install. In practice you just change the Dockerfile to:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node","index.js"]
```

This small change ensures all required npm metadata is present, the install runs in a reproducible way, and the image builds successfully. If you don’t have a package‑lock.json you can generate one locally with npm install and then commit it, or simply add a COPY package.json ./ line before the npm install as you already have; the key point is to make sure the npm install step can resolve all dependencies. After updating the Dockerfile, rerun docker‑compose up and the web service should build without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `package‑lock.json` that is copied into the Node image is not valid JSON – it contains a JavaScript‑style comment (`// …`) and a trailing comma after the last entry, which makes `npm ci` abort. Remove the comment line and any extra commas so the file is a proper JSON document (or simply delete the lock file and let `npm install` generate a new one), then rebuild the image; the rest of the Dockerfile and compose file can stay unchanged.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Node image tries to run `npm install` before the lock‑file (and therefore the exact dependency versions) are available, which can make npm try to resolve modules that aren’t present in the build context. Fix it by copying **both** `package.json` and `package-lock.json` into the image first, then running `npm ci --only=production` instead of `npm install`. In practice, change the Dockerfile to:

```
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
```

This guarantees that npm has all the metadata it needs up front, eliminates the resolve error, and still produces a lean production image. After that the compose file can build the web service without crashing.
