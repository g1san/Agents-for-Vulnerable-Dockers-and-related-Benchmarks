    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201113945 is a vulnerability in the Apache APISIX API gateway. The product ships with a hard\u2011coded default admin token (edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1). When the Admin API IP\u2011restriction rules are removed or disabled, the default token remains valid and can be used by any remote client. An attacker who knows the token can authenticate to the Admin API, create or modify routes, and inject Lua scripts via the `script` field of a route. The injected Lua code can execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host, giving the attacker full remote code execution capabilities with the privileges of the APISIX process. Affected APISIX releases are 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5.",
