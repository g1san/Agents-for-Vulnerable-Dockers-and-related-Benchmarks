    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201136401 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the open\u2011source GeoServer software. The flaw resides in GeoServer\u2019s handling of property\u2011name (XPath) expressions that are processed by the GeoTools library and the Apache Commons\u2011jxpath engine. When an OGC request (such as WFS GetFeature, GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, or WPS Execute) contains a crafted property name, the value is passed unchecked to the XPath evaluator, which executes arbitrary Java code inside the server JVM. An unauthenticated attacker can therefore inject malicious code (for example `java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)`) and obtain full command execution on the host system. Exploits have been observed in the wild, downloading additional payloads, installing back\u2011doors, and adding the compromised host to botnets. The vulnerability affects all GeoServer releases prior to the patched versions 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2. Multiple back\u2011ported patches also exist for earlier maintenance releases. The attack is performed over the network without any authentication and does not require special privileges on the target.",
