    "desc": "CVE-2023-26360 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The flaw is caused by insecure deserialization and improper access\u2011control checks in ColdFusion\u2019s JSON handling code. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing malicious serialized data to a vulnerable ColdFusion endpoint (for example, /CFIDE/AIR/Conflict.cfc or /CFIDE/wizards/common/utils.cfc), the attacker can force the server to deserialize untrusted objects, read arbitrary files, or execute any command through the <cfexecute> tag. No prior authentication or user interaction is required. Successful exploitation grants the attacker full command execution in the context of the ColdFusion process, enabling persistence, data theft, and further network compromise. Adobe released patches in March\u202f2023 (ColdFusion 2018 Update\u202f16 and ColdFusion 2021 Update\u202f6) that mitigate the issue.",
