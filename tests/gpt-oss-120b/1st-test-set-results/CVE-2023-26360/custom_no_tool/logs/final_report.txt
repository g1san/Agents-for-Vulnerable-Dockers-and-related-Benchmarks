CVE description: CVE-2023-26360 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The flaw is caused by insecure deserialization and improper access‑control checks in ColdFusion’s JSON handling code. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing malicious serialized data to a vulnerable ColdFusion endpoint (for example, /CFIDE/AIR/Conflict.cfc or /CFIDE/wizards/common/utils.cfc), the attacker can force the server to deserialize untrusted objects, read arbitrary files, or execute any command through the <cfexecute> tag. No prior authentication or user interaction is required. Successful exploitation grants the attacker full command execution in the context of the ColdFusion process, enabling persistence, data theft, and further network compromise. Adobe released patches in March 2023 (ColdFusion 2018 Update 16 and ColdFusion 2021 Update 6) that mitigate the issue.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines only two services: vuln_app (built from php:7.2-apache) and db (based on mysql:5.7). Neither service uses the Adobe ColdFusion image, nor does any service use Nginx. Consequently, the required services list ['adobe/coldfusion', 'nginx'] is not satisfied, and there is no instance of an Adobe ColdFusion version (e.g., 2018-u15, 2021-u1, etc.) present in the images. Therefore both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones fail.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines only two services: vuln_app (built from php:7.2-apache) and db (based on mysql:5.7). Neither service uses the Adobe ColdFusion image, nor does any service use Nginx. Consequently, the required services list ['adobe/coldfusion', 'nginx'] is not satisfied, and there is no instance of an Adobe ColdFusion version (e.g., 2018-u15, 2021-u1, etc.) present in the images. Therefore both the 'code_hard_version' and 'services_ok' milestones fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required service list you need to replace the generic PHP‑Apache container with an Adobe ColdFusion image that matches one of the vulnerable versions (for example adobe/coldfusion:2018‑u15 or adobe/coldfusion:2021‑u1) and add an Nginx front‑end that proxies traffic to the ColdFusion service; this means adding an “nginx” service definition that uses a recent Nginx image, mounting a configuration that forwards port 80 to the ColdFusion container’s HTTP port, and updating the compose file so the ColdFusion service is built from the proper image (or a Dockerfile that installs the correct ColdFusion update). Once those two services are present, the composition will meet the “code_hard_version” and “services_ok” milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because some of the host‑side paths you’re mounting don’t exist (or point at the wrong place) and the ColdFusion image tag you’ve referenced isn’t available in Docker Hub, so Docker can’t pull it and aborts the start‑up. Create a `coldfusion/app` directory next to the compose file (or change the volume line to point at an existing path) and make sure a `db` folder containing `init.sql` is present. Then replace the ColdFusion image with a tag that actually exists (for example `adobe/coldfusion:2018-u15` should be written as `adobe/coldfusion:2018u15` or use the latest supported tag listed on Docker Hub). After those two adjustments the services will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ColdFusion image you are pulling does not contain a */var/www/html* directory – it expects the web root under */opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot* (or a similar path depending on the exact image version). Change the ColdFusion service’s volume mapping to mount your application folder to the correct location inside the container, for example:

```
volumes:
  - ./coldfusion/app:/opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot
```

If the image tag you referenced (adobe/coldfusion:2018u15) is no longer available on Docker Hub, replace it with the currently published tag that matches the vulnerable version, such as *adobe/coldfusion:2018u15‑patch* or pull the image from the Adobe registry using the appropriate repository name. Finally, make sure the local directories (`./coldfusion/app`, `./nginx`, and `./db`) exist before you run `docker compose up`, otherwise Docker will abort with a “source path does not exist” error. After correcting the mount path and confirming the image tag is valid, the composition should build and start normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the ColdFusion image tag you reference (adobe/coldfusion:2018u15‑patch) does not exist in the public registry, so Docker cannot pull it; change the image to a valid tag such as adobe/coldfusion:2018u15‑latest (or a patched version that you have uploaded to a private registry) and verify that the image name matches exactly. Next, the nginx service tries to mount a configuration file from a relative path that may not exist at build time—make sure ./nginx/nginx.conf is present beside the compose file or adjust the volume source to the correct location. Finally, the ColdFusion script attempts to call curl against the Docker socket, which fails when the socket is not exposed; either remove that block or expose the Docker socket safely (for example, add a bind‑mount of /var/run/docker.sock to the ColdFusion container) and install curl in the image if you keep the code. After correcting the image tag, confirming the volume paths, and fixing the Docker‑socket access, the compose file builds and runs without terminating.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file is trying to mount source directories that don’t exist at the path Docker expects, and the ColdFusion image you reference (adobe/coldfusion:2018u15) requires the official Adobe‑provided image to be pulled from a private registry that isn’t publicly reachable, so Docker can’t find the base image. To fix it, first create the missing host folders (for example, run `mkdir -p dockers/CVE-2023-26360/custom_no_tool/coldfusion/app` and `mkdir -p dockers/CVE-2023-26360/custom_no_tool/nginx`) so the volume mounts resolve correctly, then replace the `adobe/coldfusion:2018u15` reference with a publicly‑available ColdFusion image (or build your own from Adobe’s installer) and add the required license‑acceptance environment variable (e.g., `CF_ACCEPT_EULA=YES`). Once those two changes are applied, Docker can pull the image, mount the directories, and the compose stack will start without the previous error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose fails because the ColdFusion container tries to mount a directory that doesn’t exist at build time – the relative path `./coldfusion/app` is resolved from the location of the compose file, but the folder isn’t present in the repository, so Docker aborts with “mount source does not exist”. Create the missing `coldfusion/app` directory (or point the volume to an existing location that contains the ColdFusion webroot) before you run `docker compose up`. While you’re there, make sure the `nginx/nginx.conf` file and the MySQL `init.sql` file are also present in the same directory tree, otherwise the bind‑mounts will fail for the same reason. After adding the missing directories/files, the services will start without the earlier build‑time error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the ColdFusion image you reference (`adobe/coldfusion:2018u15`) isn’t a valid tag in Docker Hub – the official Adobe ColdFusion images are published under tags like `2018u15-standalone` (or similar) and they require you to explicitly accept the EULA at container start‑up. Change the ColdFusion service to use a real tag (for example `adobe/coldfusion:2018u15-standalone`) and keep the `CF_ACCEPT_EULA="YES"` variable. While you’re at it, make the service wait for MySQL to become healthy by adding a condition to the `depends_on` block (e.g. `depends_on: db: { condition: service_healthy }`). Finally, point the ColdFusion web‑root volume to the exact directory that the image expects – the official image ships the web root at `/opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot/`, so the volume line should read `- ./coldfusion/app:/opt/coldfusion/cfusion/wwwroot`. Once those three tweaks are applied, Docker Compose will pull a valid image, satisfy the license check, and start the containers in the correct order, eliminating the build‑time error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the compose file is missing a top‑level version declaration, so the newer `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` syntax isn’t recognized, and the volume mount points that refer to relative paths ( `./coldfusion/app` and `./nginx/nginx.conf` ) don’t exist when Docker tries to copy them into the containers. Fix the problem by adding a version line (for example `version: "3.9"` at the very top of docker‑compose.yml), leaving the `depends_on` block unchanged, and confirming that the `coldfusion/app` directory and the `nginx/nginx.conf` file are present next to the compose file (or adjusting the host paths to the correct location). Once the version is declared and the host‑side paths exist, Docker can pull the images, apply the mounts, and the stack will start without the earlier error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is failing because the ColdFusion image can’t start – it tries to create the datasource at launch but the MySQL JDBC driver isn’t in the image, so the container exits before the health check on db can succeed. The quick fix is to extend the Adobe ColdFusion image with a tiny Dockerfile that copies the MySQL‑Connector‑J JAR into ColdFusion’s lib directory (for example /opt/coldfusion/cfusion/runtime/lib or /opt/coldfusion/cfusion/lib), then rebuild the coldfusion service from that Dockerfile. In the compose file replace image: adobe/coldfusion:2018u15-standalone with build: ./coldfusion (where ./coldfusion contains the Dockerfile that does “FROM adobe/coldfusion:2018u15‑standalone” and “ADD mysql‑connector‑java‑8.x.x.jar /opt/coldfusion/cfusion/runtime/lib/”), and remove the unsupported depends_on condition (or downgrade the compose version to 2.4 so that condition: service_healthy is honoured). After rebuilding, the ColdFusion container will start successfully, the datasource will be created, and the stack will run without the previous build‑time error.
