    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20117504 is a high\u2011severity vulnerability in the JBossMQ JMS\u2011over\u2011HTTP invocation layer that is shipped with Red\u202fHat JBoss Application Server 4.x and earlier. The vulnerable component is the class `HTTPServerILServlet.java`. The servlet accepts arbitrary serialized Java objects in the body of an HTTP POST request and deserializes them without any validation or class\u2011restriction. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted serialized payload (for example a Commons\u2011Collections gadget chain) to the servlet endpoint `/jbossmq\u2011httpil/HTTPServerILServlet`. Because the deserialization is unrestricted, the attacker\u2019s malicious object is executed on the server, resulting in full remote code execution. The impact includes arbitrary command execution, file manipulation, and complete takeover of the host running the vulnerable JBoss instance. The flaw is identified as CWE\u2011502 (Improper Control of Generation of Code) and has a CVSS score of 9.8. Mitigation requires upgrading to a version of JBoss Application Server where the servlet is removed or patched, or disabling the HTTP invocation layer entirely.",
