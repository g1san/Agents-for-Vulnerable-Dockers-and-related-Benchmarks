CVE description: CVE‑2017‑7504 is a high‑severity vulnerability in the JBossMQ JMS‑over‑HTTP invocation layer that is shipped with Red Hat JBoss Application Server 4.x and earlier. The vulnerable component is the class `HTTPServerILServlet.java`. The servlet accepts arbitrary serialized Java objects in the body of an HTTP POST request and deserializes them without any validation or class‑restriction. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted serialized payload (for example a Commons‑Collections gadget chain) to the servlet endpoint `/jbossmq‑httpil/HTTPServerILServlet`. Because the deserialization is unrestricted, the attacker’s malicious object is executed on the server, resulting in full remote code execution. The impact includes arbitrary command execution, file manipulation, and complete takeover of the host running the vulnerable JBoss instance. The flaw is identified as CWE‑502 (Improper Control of Generation of Code) and has a CVSS score of 9.8. Mitigation requires upgrading to a version of JBoss Application Server where the servlet is removed or patched, or disabling the HTTP invocation layer entirely.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup only uses a Python 3.9-slim base image for the app service and a MySQL 5.7 image for the database. No jboss/jboss-as or openjdk images are referenced, so the required services are missing, causing the services_ok milestone to fail. Since jboss/jboss-as is not used at all, no vulnerable version from the provided list is present, resulting in the code_hard_version milestone being false as well.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup only uses a Python 3.9-slim base image for the app service and a MySQL 5.7 image for the database. No jboss/jboss-as or openjdk images are referenced, so the required services are missing, causing the services_ok milestone to fail. Since jboss/jboss-as is not used at all, no vulnerable version from the provided list is present, resulting in the code_hard_version milestone being false as well.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to add a service that runs the JBoss Application Server image containing the vulnerable HTTPServerILServlet, and make sure a compatible Java runtime is available; the simplest way is to insert a new service in docker‑compose.yml such as jboss using image: jboss/jboss-as:4.1.0.GA (and optionally environment: JAVA_OPTS…) and have it depend on the MySQL container if required, while keeping the existing app and db services unchanged. This brings the required jboss/jboss-as and OpenJDK runtime into the composition, so the presence check for the vulnerable version succeeds and the code‑hard‑version condition can be met.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Python‑slim base image does not have the tools needed for a reliable pip install and the compose file is pointing to a directory that Docker cannot locate when it runs the build. The quickest fix is to modify the app Dockerfile so it upgrades pip, installs any missing system packages (for example ca‑certificates and git which some wheels need), and makes sure the working directory is set correctly before copying the source files. In practice you would change the Dockerfile to start with:

```
FROM python:3.9-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && pip install --upgrade pip
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python","app.py"]
```

and verify that the docker‑compose.yml service app uses the correct relative build context (the ./app folder is present next to the compose file). With those two small changes the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the JBoss Dockerfile is trying to download a tarball from a URL that does not exist for the old 4.x series, so the wget step returns a 404 and the subsequent tar command aborts. Fix it by changing the download line to point at the historic JBoss‑AS archive (for example `https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.1.0.GA/jboss-4.1.0.GA.tar.gz`) and updating the `wget -q … -O /tmp/jboss.tar.gz` command accordingly; after extracting, add a `chmod +x bin/run.sh` so the start script is executable. With the correct archive URL and proper permissions the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the JBoss image is based on `openjdk:8-jdk-slim`, which does not include the `tar` utility needed to extract the downloaded archive, so the `tar -xzf` command cannot run. Add `tar` to the list of packages installed in the Dockerfile (e.g., change the apt‑get line to `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates tar`) and keep the rest of the steps unchanged; this supplies the missing tool and allows the JBoss distribution to be unpacked, after which the container will build and start correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing in the JBoss image because the run.sh script in the JBoss 4.1 distribution is a shell script that expects a POSIX‑compatible shell, but the openjdk:8‑jdk‑slim image only provides /sh linked to dash, which does not understand some of the Bash‑specific syntax used in the script; the simplest fix is to install bash and invoke the script with it. Change the JBoss Dockerfile to add bash to the package list, then run the script via bash instead of relying on the default sh. For example, after the apt‑get install line add bash to the packages, and replace the final CMD with `CMD ["bash","./bin/run.sh","-c","default"]`. This ensures the script runs correctly and the image builds without errors.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing inside the JBoss image because the tarball you’re trying to fetch either isn’t found (or redirects) and the `tar` command then aborts with “cannot open: No such file or directory”. Change the Dockerfile to use a reliable, direct URL (for example `https://download.jboss.org/jbossas/4.1.0.GA/jboss-4.1.0.GA.tar.gz`) and add the `-L` flag to `wget` (or switch to `curl -L`) so any HTTP redirects are followed; then keep the same `tar -xzf … -C /opt/jboss --strip-components=1` line. After the archive is successfully extracted, the `chmod +x /opt/jboss/bin/run.sh` and the `CMD ["bash","./bin/run.sh","-c","default"]` will work without error, letting the image build to completion.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the JBoss Dockerfile tries to download a tarball from the old JBoss 4.1.0.GA repository using a plain wget command, but the URL no longer resolves and the extracted directory layout does not contain a bin/run.sh script that matches the arguments you pass, so the final CMD cannot start the server. To fix it, replace the wget line with a reliable source (for example, mirror the JBoss‑4.1.0.GA archive to a reachable location or use a known‑good URL such as https://downloads.jboss.org/jbossas/4.1.0.GA/jboss-4.1.0.GA.tar.gz), add the --no-check-certificate flag if needed, and after extracting the archive verify that the bin/run.sh file exists; if it does not, adjust the CMD to invoke the correct launch script (e.g., CMD ["bash","./bin/jboss-cli.sh","-c"] or simply CMD ["./bin/run.sh"]). Also ensure the run.sh file has executable permission (chmod +x) and that any required runtime dependencies (such as bash or netcat if the script expects them) are installed in the openjdk:8-jdk‑slim image. After updating the URL, correcting the command line, and confirming the script’s permissions, the JBoss image should build successfully and the whole compose stack will start without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the JBoss image can’t find the run.sh script after the archive is extracted – the tar command in the slim base image extracts the files into a sub‑directory (the archive itself contains a top‑level folder called jboss‑4.1.0.GA) and the --strip‑components=1 option isn’t being applied correctly, leaving the JBoss home one level deeper than /opt/jboss. To fix it, modify the JBoss Dockerfile so the archive is extracted directly into /opt/jboss and then make the start‑up script executable. A minimal change looks like this:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-slim
ENV JBoss_VERSION=4.1.0.GA
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates tar bash && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && wget -q -O /tmp/jboss.tar.gz https://downloads.jboss.org/jbossas/4.1.0.GA/jboss-4.1.0.GA.tar.gz \
    && mkdir -p /opt/jboss \
    && tar -xzf /tmp/jboss.tar.gz -C /opt/jboss --strip-components=1 \
    && rm /tmp/jboss.tar.gz \
    && chmod +x /opt/jboss/bin/run.sh
ENV JBOSS_HOME=/opt/jboss
ENV PATH=$JBOSS_HOME/bin:$PATH
WORKDIR $JBOSS_HOME
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["bash","./bin/run.sh","-c","default"]
```

With the archive correctly unpacked, the run.sh file will be at /opt/jboss/bin/run.sh, the container will start, and the overall compose build will succeed. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the JBoss download URL in the JBoss Dockerfile is no longer valid – the server now redirects HTTPS requests in a way that the slim image’s ca‑certificates and wget version can’t follow, causing a 404 and leaving the tar file empty, which makes the subsequent tar extraction error out. Change the RUN line to fetch the archive from a working location (for example use the HTTP endpoint or a current mirror) and add a checksum verification so the file is known to be correct, then keep the rest of the steps unchanged; after correcting the URL (or switching to the .zip variant and extracting with unzip) the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
