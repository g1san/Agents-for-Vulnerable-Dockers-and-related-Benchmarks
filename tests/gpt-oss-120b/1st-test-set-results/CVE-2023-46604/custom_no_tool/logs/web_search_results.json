    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201146604 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ that affects the Java OpenWire protocol marshaller. The marshaller incorrectly allows arbitrary class instantiation when deserializing OpenWire commands. An attacker who can reach the OpenWire TCP port (default 61616) can send a crafted OpenWire frame that forces the broker or any Java OpenWire client to load a class from the classpath with a String argument. By choosing a class that executes code on construction, such as Spring's ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, the attacker can cause the target process to download a malicious XML configuration file and execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the ActiveMQ process. This results in full remote code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the broker or client system. The vulnerability exists in both Apache ActiveMQ Classic and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis when they include the vulnerable OpenWire support. Patches are available for Classic versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, 5.18.3, and 6.0.0, and for Artemis version 2.31.2. Until the software is upgraded, any network\u2011accessible OpenWire endpoint is exploitable.",
