CVE description: CVE‑2023‑46604 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ that affects the Java OpenWire protocol marshaller. The marshaller incorrectly allows arbitrary class instantiation when deserializing OpenWire commands. An attacker who can reach the OpenWire TCP port (default 61616) can send a crafted OpenWire frame that forces the broker or any Java OpenWire client to load a class from the classpath with a String argument. By choosing a class that executes code on construction, such as Spring's ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, the attacker can cause the target process to download a malicious XML configuration file and execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the ActiveMQ process. This results in full remote code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the broker or client system. The vulnerability exists in both Apache ActiveMQ Classic and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis when they include the vulnerable OpenWire support. Patches are available for Classic versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, 5.18.3, and 6.0.0, and for Artemis version 2.31.2. Until the software is upgraded, any network‑accessible OpenWire endpoint is exploitable.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker configuration uses only the 'docker:24.0.2-dind' image and does not include any of the required services (apache/activemq or apache/activemq-artemis). Consequently, it does not use any of the listed vulnerable versions for those services, and the expected services are missing from the compose file.
	- ERROR: The Docker configuration uses only the 'docker:24.0.2-dind' image and does not include any of the required services (apache/activemq or apache/activemq-artemis). Consequently, it does not use any of the listed vulnerable versions for those services, and the expected services are missing from the compose file.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, extend the compose file by defining a service for the vulnerable broker—either Apache ActiveMQ Classic or Artemis—using an image that matches the affected versions (for example, apache/activemq:5.17.5 or apache/activemq-artemis:2.31.1). Include the necessary port mappings (e.g., 61616:61616) and any required environment variables so the broker starts alongside the existing “dind” service. Once the broker service is added, the compose configuration will contain the missing components that are relevant to CVE‑2023‑46604.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file itself is syntactically correct, so the failure is most likely coming from the health‑check on the activemq service – the official apache/activemq image does not include the curl binary, so the `curl -f http://localhost:8161/admin/` command exits with “command not found” and Docker marks the container as unhealthy, causing the compose run to stop. The quickest fix is to replace the health‑check with a command that is guaranteed to exist in the image (for example `wget -qO- http://localhost:8161/admin/`), or simply remove the health‑check if you don’t need it. Another minor tweak is to ensure the `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` environment line for the dind service is written without the trailing equals sign (i.e. `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=`) so Docker disables TLS correctly. After making those two changes the stack should start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the docker‑compose.yml refers to a healthcheck that uses curl, which the rmohr/activemq image does not contain; Docker then treats the missing command as a failure and aborts the service start‑up. Remove the healthcheck definition entirely or replace it with a command that exists in the image (for example wget or nc to probe the OpenWire port) and update the healthcheck section accordingly. After deleting or correcting the healthcheck block, the compose file will be syntactically valid and the containers will launch without the termination error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the “dind” service starts a Docker daemon without any persistent storage, so the daemon crashes as soon as it tries to write its state; adding a bind‑mount for Docker’s data directory resolves the issue. Edit the compose file so that the dind container includes a volume mapping for /var/lib/docker (for example ‑‑volume /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker) and keep the privileged flag; this gives the inner daemon a writable location and prevents the termination error. After adding the volume line, restart the stack and the images will build correctly.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the “dind” service tries to bind a host directory (/var/lib/docker) that does not exist or is not writable inside the container, and the Docker daemon inside the DIND image also needs access to the host’s socket if you intend to control the outer Docker engine. To fix it, change the volume definition for the dind service to use a bind mount that points to a directory you create on the host (for example, create /opt/dind-data and then use `- /opt/dind-data:/var/lib/docker`) and, if you want the inner daemon to manage the outer engine, add `- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` to the same service. Also make sure the environment line `- DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` is kept but quoted so it does not get interpreted as an empty variable, e.g., `- "DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR="`. After these adjustments the compose file should start both services without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the dind service is trying to bind the host Docker socket into a Docker‑in‑Docker container while also exposing its own daemon on the same socket, which causes a conflict and often a permissions error if the host path /opt/dind-data doesn’t exist or isn’t writable. To fix it, remove the “/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock” bind‑mount (it isn’t needed for a self‑contained dind instance) and make sure the host directory /opt/dind-data is created beforehand with appropriate permissions, or change the volume to a path that already exists. While you’re updating the compose file, also bump the ActiveMQ image to a patched version (e.g., apache/activemq:5.17.7 or newer) to eliminate the CVE‑2023‑46604 vulnerability. After those adjustments the compose should start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the ActiveMQ image you’re pulling (5.17.6) is still vulnerable and the Docker‑in‑Docker service needs a persistent storage mount for its graph database; the quickest fix is to upgrade the ActiveMQ service to a patched release (for example apache/activemq:5.18.3) and add a volume mapping for the broker’s data directory so the container can start cleanly. You can also remove the empty DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR line (it isn’t needed when TLS is disabled) and add a simple `depends_on: - dind` under the activemq service to ensure the daemon is ready before ActiveMQ starts. After making those three edits (upgrade image tag, add a data volume, and clean up the environment line) the compose should bring both services up without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: Add a version header (for example `version: "3.8"` at the top) so the compose file is parsed with a known schema, and simplify the `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR` entry to the unquoted form `- DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` to avoid the stray‑quote parsing error. Also make sure the volume names used under `volumes:` match exactly the names referenced in the services (they already do) and that the `command` array is correctly indented under the `dind` service. With those small syntax tweaks the stack will start without the build‑time failure.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file itself is syntactically correct, so the build failure is coming from the way the Dind service is started. The Docker‑in‑Docker image expects the host’s cgroup driver to be compatible and the daemon to be launched with the `--registry-mirror` flag removed (the default entrypoint already starts `dockerd`). To fix the error, replace the custom `command` line with the standard entrypoint by removing the explicit `dockerd` invocation and just expose the TCP socket through the environment variable `DOCKER_HOST`. In practice you can delete the `command:` block entirely and add the line `- DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=` (as you already have) to keep the daemon insecure on port 2375. Then make sure the `activemq` service references the correct, patched image tag (e.g. `apache/activemq:5.18.3` which already contains the fix for CVE‑2023‑46604). After this change the compose file will bring up both containers without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
