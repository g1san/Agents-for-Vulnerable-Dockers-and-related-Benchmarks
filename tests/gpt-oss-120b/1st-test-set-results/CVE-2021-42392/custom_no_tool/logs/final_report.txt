CVE description: CVE‑2021‑42392 is a critical vulnerability in the H2 Database Engine (Java SQL database) that allows an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. The flaw resides in the method `org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection`, which accepts a driver class name and a JDBC URL. When the supplied driver class is assignable to `javax.naming.Context`, H2 instantiates the driver and performs a JNDI lookup on the supplied URL. An attacker can provide `javax.naming.InitialContext` (or any other `Context` implementation) as the driver and a malicious LDAP or RMI URL (e.g., `ldap://attacker.com/Exploit`). This causes the Java runtime to download and execute arbitrary classes from the attacker‑controlled server, giving the attacker full code execution inside the process that hosts the H2 server or the web container running the H2 Console. The primary attack surface is the H2 web console, which by default binds to localhost on port 8082 but can be made reachable to remote users with the `-webAllowOthers` option or when embedded in frameworks that expose it. No authentication is required; the attacker merely sends a crafted request to the console login form containing the malicious driver and URL fields. Successful exploitation results in complete compromise of the host, as the attacker can run any command, read or modify data, and install persistence mechanisms. The vulnerability affects all H2 releases prior to version 2.0.206 (including the entire 1.x series).

./../../dockers/CVE-2021-42392/custom_no_tool





Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To resolve the build failure, update the Dockerfile so it pulls a patched H2 release (for example version 2.0.206 or later) instead of an older vulnerable artifact, and make sure the base image uses the matching OpenJDK tag (such as openjdk:11‑jre‑slim). Replace any hard‑coded download URL or Maven coordinate that points to a pre‑2.0.206 version with the new version string, then rebuild; the newer binary contains the corrected `JdbcUtils.getConnection` logic and the image will compile without the JNDI‑related error. Additionally, remove any command‑line flags that expose the H2 console to the network (‑webAllowOthers) unless explicitly required, and if the console must stay enabled bind it only to localhost. After these changes the Docker build should complete successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely dies because the H2 server is started as a background job (`&`) and then the script ends without a proper PID 1 process to keep the container alive; additionally the database directory isn’t created beforehand, so the server fails to start. Fix it by creating the data folder in the image (add `RUN mkdir -p /opt/db` to the Dockerfile) and by removing the background operator – after the optional `RunScript` step, replace the shell with the server process using `exec`. In practice, change the entrypoint to start the server without `&` and end with `exec java -cp /opt/h2.jar org.h2.tools.Server …`, which makes the H2 server the container’s main PID and guarantees the container stays up.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container fails because the H2 server is started with ‑tcpAllowOthers and ‑webAllowOthers set to false, which restricts connections to the loopback interface; when Docker publishes the ports the server cannot be reached and may even abort if it detects a mismatch between the bind address and the exposed ports. Change the entrypoint command to use ‑tcpAllowOthers true and ‑webAllowOthers true (or at least true for the interfaces you need) so the server binds on all interfaces. Additionally, the slim JRE image does not include the certificate bundle required for HTTPS downloads, so the wget step can fail; add ca‑certificates to the apt install line (e.g., apt‑get install -y wget ca‑certificates) to ensure the JAR is fetched successfully. After these two edits the container should build and run correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile uses H2_VERSION=2.0.206, which is not present in the provided list of vulnerable H2 versions (the list ends at 2.0.205). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone, which checks for the use of a vulnerable H2 version, is not satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Dockerfile uses H2_VERSION=2.0.206, which is not present in the provided list of vulnerable H2 versions (the list ends at 2.0.205). Therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone, which checks for the use of a vulnerable H2 version, is not satisfied.
	- FIX: Change the H2_VERSION environment variable in the Dockerfile from 2.0.206 to a version that appears in the vulnerable list, for example 2.0.205; then the wget line will download the corresponding vulnerable h2‑*.jar and the build will satisfy the code_hard_version check. If you prefer to keep the current version you would need to add 2.0.206 to the allowed‑version list, but the simplest fix is just to set H2_VERSION=2.0.205 and rebuild the image.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the slim OpenJDK image does not contain the `wget` binary by default and the `apt-get` step leaves the package list in a state that later layers cannot use, so the `wget` command that pulls the H2 jar never succeeds and the subsequent `java` commands cannot find the jar. Fix it by installing `wget` (and the CA certificates needed for HTTPS) in a single `RUN` that also cleans the apt caches, for example `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, and be sure the `entrypoint.sh` file has Unix line endings and is marked executable (the `chmod +x` already does that). After these changes the image builds, the H2 jar is downloaded correctly, and the container can start the server.


Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
