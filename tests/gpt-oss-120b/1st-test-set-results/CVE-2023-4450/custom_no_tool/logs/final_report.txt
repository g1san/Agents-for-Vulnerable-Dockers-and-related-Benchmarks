CVE description: CVE‑2023‑4450 is a remote code execution vulnerability in JeecgBoot's built‑in reporting module JimuReport. The vulnerable endpoint `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/queryFieldBySql` accepts a JSON body with a user‑supplied `sql` field that is directly concatenated into a FreeMarker template and evaluated without any sanitisation. An attacker can inject FreeMarker expressions that instantiate `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` (or use advanced Spring‑EL techniques) to run arbitrary operating‑system commands on the server. No authentication or sandboxing is required if the endpoint is publicly reachable. The vulnerability affects all JeecgBoot JimuReport versions older than 1.6.0. Successful exploitation results in full system compromise, data breach, service disruption, and possible lateral movement. The issue is mitigated by upgrading to JimuReport 1.6.1 or later, restricting access to the vulnerable endpoint, sanitising user input, and disabling dangerous FreeMarker utilities.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker setup does not include the service 'jeecg/jeecg-boot', nor does it use any of the allowed versions listed (1.5.0‑1.5.5). Additionally, the compose file only defines two services ('docker' and 'vulnerable_app') and does not contain the required services 'jeecg/jeecg-boot', 'mysql', or 'nginx'. Therefore both milestones fail.
	- ERROR: The provided Docker setup does not include the service 'jeecg/jeecg-boot', nor does it use any of the allowed versions listed (1.5.0‑1.5.5). Additionally, the compose file only defines two services ('docker' and 'vulnerable_app') and does not contain the required services 'jeecg/jeecg-boot', 'mysql', or 'nginx'. Therefore both milestones fail.
	- FIX: To resolve the missing‑service issue you need to extend the compose file so it launches the exact stack required for CVE‑2023‑4450 testing: add a MySQL container using the 8.0.33 image, add an Nginx container (1.27.0) configured as a reverse‑proxy, and replace the placeholder “vulnerable_app” service with the official JeecgBoot image (e.g., jeecg/jeecg-boot:1.5.5) built from the supplied Dockerfile or pulled from the registry. The JeecgBoot service should expose port 8080 (or the port used by the app), depend on mysql, and have the appropriate environment variables (DB connection URL, credentials) so it can start correctly; nginx should forward external traffic to that port. Finally, adjust any network aliases so the services can resolve each other (e.g., mysql as db, nginx as web) and ensure the Docker‑in‑Docker daemon remains for any auxiliary testing. After adding these three services with the correct images and version tags, the compose file will satisfy both milestones.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Python image only installs Flask, yet the application imports the Docker SDK in the /listcontainers handler; adding the missing package to the dependency list resolves the error. Edit requirements.txt to include a line with docker (and keep flask on its own line), then rebuild the image so that pip installs both libraries. Once the SDK is present the Dockerfile will succeed, and the container can start without import‑related crashes.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails to build because the slim‑based Python base image does not contain the system libraries required to compile the docker Python client (its dependencies need a C compiler and SSL headers). To fix it, change the Dockerfile to install the missing build tools and libraries before running pip install — for example, add a line that runs apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y gcc python3‑dev libffi-dev libssl-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* right after setting the work directory, then keep the existing pip install command. After installing those packages the docker module will compile successfully and the image will build without errors. (Alternatively you could switch to a non‑slim Python image, but the key is to provide the required build‑time dependencies.)


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state, but its healthcheck is failing. The health status is 'starting' with a failing streak of 2, and the healthcheck logs show 'wget: can\'t connect to remote host: Connection refused' when trying to reach http://localhost:8080. This indicates that the service inside the container is not responding as expected, so the container is not considered healthy.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state, but its healthcheck is failing. The health status is 'starting' with a failing streak of 2, and the healthcheck logs show 'wget: can\'t connect to remote host: Connection refused' when trying to reach http://localhost:8080. This indicates that the service inside the container is not responding as expected, so the container is not considered healthy.
	- FIX: The healthcheck is failing because the jeecg service is using a placeholder Alpine image that never starts the JeecgBoot application on port 8080, so there is nothing for wget to connect to. Replace the placeholder image with a real JeecgBoot image (or build one that launches the Java server) and ensure the container’s entrypoint starts the JeecgBoot process listening on 0.0.0.0:8080; once the actual server is running the healthcheck will succeed. If you cannot use a pre‑built image, add a startup script that runs the JeecgBoot JAR (e.g., java -jar jeecg-boot.jar ) and expose port 8080 so the healthcheck can reach it.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim Python image lacks the compiler tool‑chain needed by the Docker SDK, so the `apt‑get install gcc python3‑dev libffi‑dev libssl‑dev` step cannot satisfy all native dependencies. Replace that line with a single install of the full build‑essential stack (for example `apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) and then reinstall the Python requirements; this provides the missing C compiler and headers, allowing the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step to succeed and the image to build correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container process is running (State.Running is true) and serves HTTP requests (logs show 200 responses), but its healthcheck is failing. The defined healthcheck uses the command "wget -qO- http://localhost:8080" which cannot be executed because the "wget" binary is not present in the container ("executable file not found in $PATH"). The health status is reported as "starting" with a failing streak of 2, indicating the container has not yet passed its healthcheck. Therefore the container is not considered fully healthy.
	- ERROR: The container process is running (State.Running is true) and serves HTTP requests (logs show 200 responses), but its healthcheck is failing. The defined healthcheck uses the command "wget -qO- http://localhost:8080" which cannot be executed because the "wget" binary is not present in the container ("executable file not found in $PATH"). The health status is reported as "starting" with a failing streak of 2, indicating the container has not yet passed its healthcheck. Therefore the container is not considered fully healthy.
	- FIX: Fix the failure by ensuring the health‑check command is available inside the jeecg container. Edit ./jeecg/Dockerfile to install a small HTTP client (for example, add RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y --no‑install‑recommends wget && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) before the CMD line, or replace the healthcheck with a command that uses a tool already present, such as curl or a simple Python request. After rebuilding and redeploying the image the healthcheck will succeed and the container will be marked healthy.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running (State.Running=True) but its health status is "unhealthy". The defined healthcheck tries to run "curl -f http://localhost:5000", and Docker logs show repeated failures: "OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"curl\" executable file not found in $PATH". Because the healthcheck cannot execute curl, the container is considered unhealthy despite the Flask app being started. This indicates the container is not running correctly.

The defined healthcheck tries to run "curl -f http://localhost:5000", and Docker logs show repeated failures: "OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"curl\" executable file not found in $PATH". Because the healthcheck cannot execute curl, the container is considered unhealthy despite the Flask app being started. This indicates the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Add the missing curl binary to the vulnerable_app image so the health‑check can run. The simplest fix is to modify app/Dockerfile to install curl (for example, after the apt‑get update line add apt‑get install -y --no‑install‑recommends curl and then clean up the apt cache). Once curl is present, the health‑check command curl -f http://localhost:5000 will succeed and the container will be reported as healthy. Alternatively you could replace the health‑check with wget (which is already installed by the base image) by changing the compose file’s healthcheck test to ["CMD","wget","-qO-","http://localhost:5000"] , but adding curl is the most direct fix.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is reported as running (State.Running = true) but its health check is continuously failing. The health status is "unhealthy" with a failing streak of 6, and the health‑check logs show "exec failed: curl: executable file not found in $PATH". Because the health check (CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000) cannot be executed, the container is considered unhealthy and therefore not running correctly.

The health status is "unhealthy" with a failing streak of 6, and the health‑check logs show "exec failed: curl: executable file not found in $PATH". Because the health check (CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000) cannot be executed, the container is considered unhealthy and therefore not running correctly.
	- FIX: The health‑check fails because the nginx image you are using (nginx:1.27.0) does not contain the `curl` binary, so the command `curl -f http://localhost` cannot be executed. To fix it, either install curl in the nginx container (for example, create a small Dockerfile that extends the official image and adds `apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) and update the compose service to build from that Dockerfile, or replace the health‑check command with a tool that already exists in the base image such as `wget -qO- http://localhost || exit 1`. After the health‑check command can run, the container will report a healthy status.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state (State.Running = true) and serves HTTP requests (STDERR shows successful GETs with 200 responses). However, the configured healthcheck is failing: Health.Status is "starting" and two healthcheck attempts have ExitCode 4, indicating the health command (`wget -qO- http://localhost`) did not succeed. Since the healthcheck does not pass, the container is not considered healthy, so it is not running correctly according to the required milestone.

Since the healthcheck does not pass, the container is not considered healthy, so it is not running correctly according to the required milestone.
	- FIX: The healthcheck is failing because the container’s HTTP server is listening on port 8080, while the health command tries to reach the default port 80 (`wget -qO- http://localhost`). To fix it, change the healthcheck in docker‑compose.yml to use the correct address—`wget -qO- http://localhost:8080`—or modify the Jeecg container’s CMD to serve on port 80 instead of 8080; either adjustment will allow the health probe to succeed and report the container as healthy.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The composition does not include the jeecg/jeecg-boot image at any of the listed hard versions (1.5.0‑1.5.5); the 'jeecg' service is built from a custom Python image, not the jeecg‑boot product. Consequently the required service list ['jeecg/jeecg-boot', 'mysql', 'nginx'] is not satisfied because the jeecg/jeecg-boot service is missing, even though mysql and nginx are present.
