    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u20114450 is a remote code execution vulnerability in JeecgBoot's built\u2011in reporting module JimuReport. The vulnerable endpoint `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/queryFieldBySql` accepts a JSON body with a user\u2011supplied `sql` field that is directly concatenated into a FreeMarker template and evaluated without any sanitisation. An attacker can inject FreeMarker expressions that instantiate `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` (or use advanced Spring\u2011EL techniques) to run arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the server. No authentication or sandboxing is required if the endpoint is publicly reachable. The vulnerability affects all JeecgBoot JimuReport versions older than 1.6.0. Successful exploitation results in full system compromise, data breach, service disruption, and possible lateral movement. The issue is mitigated by upgrading to JimuReport 1.6.1 or later, restricting access to the vulnerable endpoint, sanitising user input, and disabling dangerous FreeMarker utilities.",
