    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u201142323 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache HertzBeat (incubating) versions prior to 1.6.0. The product uses the SnakeYAML library to parse user\u2011supplied YAML configuration files that are sent to the `/api/monitors/import` and `/api/alert/defines/import` endpoints. SnakeYAML\u2019s `load` method deserializes the YAML without a whitelist, allowing an attacker who has valid HertzBeat credentials to upload a crafted YAML payload that triggers Java object deserialization. The deserialization can instantiate objects such as `java.lang.Runtime` or `org.h2.jdbc.JdbcConnection` that execute arbitrary commands on the host, giving the attacker full control of the monitoring server and the underlying infrastructure.",
