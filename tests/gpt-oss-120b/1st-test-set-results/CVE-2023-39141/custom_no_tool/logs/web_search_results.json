    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201139141 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Node.js server component (node\u2011server.js) of the webui\u2011aria2 project, which provides a web based graphical interface for the aria2 download utility. The server reads the requested file name directly from the HTTP request URL and passes it to fs.readFileSync without any validation or restriction to a fixed serving directory. An unauthenticated remote attacker can therefore supply \"../\" sequences in the path and cause the server to read any file that is readable by the process user (typically the www user). For example, a request such as `http://host:8888/../../../etc/passwd` will return the contents of /etc/passwd. The impact is the disclosure of confidential files, configuration data, private keys and any other data accessible to the web server process. No patched version exists; all released versions and the latest commit are affected.",
