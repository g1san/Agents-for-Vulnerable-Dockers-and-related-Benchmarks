CVE description: CVE‑2023‑39141 is a directory‑traversal vulnerability in the Node.js server component (node‑server.js) of the webui‑aria2 project, which provides a web based graphical interface for the aria2 download utility. The server reads the requested file name directly from the HTTP request URL and passes it to fs.readFileSync without any validation or restriction to a fixed serving directory. An unauthenticated remote attacker can therefore supply "../" sequences in the path and cause the server to read any file that is readable by the process user (typically the www user). For example, a request such as `http://host:8888/../../../etc/passwd` will return the contents of /etc/passwd. The impact is the disclosure of confidential files, configuration data, private keys and any other data accessible to the web server process. No patched version exists; all released versions and the latest commit are affected.
Attack Type: unauthenticated remote file read
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][webui-aria2][['latest', 'v2.2.0', 'v2.1.2', 'v2.0.5', 'v1.7.1']] The vulnerable webui-aria2 Node.js server that contains the path‑traversal flaw; this container is the core component required to reproduce CVE‑2023‑39141.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.27.0']] Optional reverse‑proxy to expose the webui-aria2 service on a standard HTTP port and to allow easy testing of the vulnerability through a web front‑end.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running (State.Running = true) but mongo‑express cannot successfully connect to the MongoDB backend. Logs show multiple connection‑refused attempts and an Unsupported OP_QUERY error when listing databases, indicating the service is not functioning correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is running (State.Running = true) but mongo‑express cannot successfully connect to the MongoDB backend. Logs show multiple connection‑refused attempts and an Unsupported OP_QUERY error when listing databases, indicating the service is not functioning correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is caused by a mismatch between the credentials that MongoDB creates at start‑up and the ones mongo‑express tries to use when it connects. By default the official mongo image only creates the *root* user (admin/secret) after it runs any scripts found in /docker‑entrypoint‑initdb.d, but the init script you provide only creates a regular user in “testdb”. As a result the MongoDB server is running with authentication enabled, yet mongo‑express is trying to log in with the “user/pass” basic‑auth settings while also using the default “admin/secret” admin credentials, which leads to connection‑refused and OP_QUERY errors.

Fix it by (1) making the admin user that MongoDB creates match what mongo‑express expects, or (2) telling mongo‑express to use the test‑db user you create. The simplest change is to replace the BASIC‑AUTH settings with the MongoDB admin credentials and add the MongoDB database‑login variables required by the mongo‑express image. Update the mongo‑express service in docker‑compose.yml to something like:

```
mongo-express:
  image: mongo-express:0.54.0
  container_name: mongo_express_vuln
  restart: always
  environment:
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: admin
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: secret
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mongo
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_DATABASE: admin        # tell it to authenticate against the admin database
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN: "true"        # give it admin privileges
    # optional: remove the BASIC‑AUTH fields if you don’t need an extra web login
  ports:
    - "8081:8081"
  depends_on:
    - mongo
```

If you prefer to keep the “testuser/testpass” account, add the corresponding variables instead:

```
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_USERNAME: testuser
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PASSWORD: testpass
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_DATABASE: testdb
```

Finally, add a healthcheck to the MongoDB service so that mongo‑express only starts after MongoDB is ready, for example:

```
mongo:
  …
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "mongo", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 2s
    retries: 10
```

These small changes align the authentication details between the two containers and ensure mongo‑express can successfully connect to the MongoDB backend.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running (State.Running is true) but the logs show repeated connection refusals to the MongoDB service ("/dev/tcp/mongo/27017: Connection refused") and a MongoError indicating an unsupported OP_QUERY command when trying to list databases. Although Mongo Express reports that it is listening on port 8081, it cannot successfully connect to the backend MongoDB instance, so the service is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is running (State.Running is true) but the logs show repeated connection refusals to the MongoDB service ("/dev/tcp/mongo/27017: Connection refused") and a MongoError indicating an unsupported OP_QUERY command when trying to list databases. Although Mongo Express reports that it is listening on port 8081, it cannot successfully connect to the backend MongoDB instance, so the service is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: Fix the issue by making sure Mongo Express only starts after MongoDB is fully ready and by supplying the correct connection parameters. Change the depends_on section to use a health‑check condition (e.g. depends_on: mongo: condition: service_healthy) so the express container waits for the mongo healthcheck to succeed, and add ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT: "27017" to the express environment to explicitly set the port. Verify that the username, password and authentication database used by Mongo Express match the admin user created by the mongo‑init.js script (they already do), and ensure the init script is mounted as read‑only at the correct path (the current mount is fine). Finally, use a recent version of mongo‑express (or set ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN: false) that is compatible with MongoDB 6.0 to avoid the OP_QUERY error; upgrading to the latest mongo‑express image resolves the protocol mismatch. After these changes the two containers will be able to communicate and Mongo Express will display the data correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the `mongo` service tries to mount `./mongo-init.js` from the host, but the path is wrong relative to where `docker‑compose` is executed (the file lives in `dockers/CVE-2023-39141/custom_no_tool/`, while the command is likely run from a higher directory). To fix it, change the volume line to reference the correct location, for example `- ${PWD}/mongo-init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo-init.js:ro` if you run compose from the same directory as the file, or move the file next to the `docker‑compose.yml` and keep `- ./mongo-init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo-init.js:ro`. After correcting the host‑side path the services will start normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the host‑side path used for the init script does not resolve to a real file when the stack is started, so Mongo can’t mount `${PWD}/dockers/CVE-2023-39141/custom_no_tool/mongo-init.js`. Fix it by changing the volume declaration to point at the actual location of the script relative to the compose file (for example `./mongo-init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo-init.js:ro` if the script lives in the same directory as the compose file, or substitute an absolute path like `/full/path/to/mongo-init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo-init.js:ro`). After correcting the mount path and ensuring the file exists and is readable by Docker, the services will start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the health‑check for the Mongo container tries to run `mongo --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"` without authenticating, so the command exits with an error and the service never becomes healthy, causing dependent containers to fail. Fix it by adding the root credentials to the health‑check command (or disabling authentication for the check), for example:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "mongo", "-u", "admin", "-p", "secret", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 2s
  retries: 10
```

With the health‑check now succeeding, `mongo‑express` can start and the compose file will run without terminating. No other changes to the `mongo‑init.js` or service definitions are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is most likely caused by the bind‑mount for the initialization script not being found or being inaccessible, so I would first verify that the file mongo‑init.js actually resides next to the docker‑compose.yml and that the relative path `./mongo‑init.js` is correct; if the compose file is invoked from a different working directory, change the mount to an absolute path (e.g., `${PWD}/mongo‑init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo‑init.js:ro`). Next, I would make sure the script has read permission for the container’s user (usually root) and that the MongoDB image can execute the healthcheck – adding `--quiet` to the mongo command or quoting the full command as a single string often resolves parsing issues. Finally, I would confirm that the MongoDB version tag is correct and that the compose file syntax (indentation, YAML structure) is valid; after these adjustments the services should start without the previous error.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build stops because the compose file tries to mount ${PWD}/mongo‑init.js into the Mongo container, but the variable isn’t expanded in the current context (or the path is invalid), causing Docker to fail the volume bind. Change the volume line to a plain relative path, for example - "./mongo‑init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo‑init.js:ro", and make sure the file really exists next to the compose file. After correcting the bind mount path the services start without errors.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure isn’t caused by anything in the MongoDB image itself – it’s the way the compose file references the initialization script. Docker Compose resolves host‐side volume paths relative to the directory you run the command from, so the line  

```yaml
- "./mongo-init.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mongo-init.js:ro"
```  

fails if the current working directory isn’t the folder that actually contains mongo‑init.js. To fix it, either run docker‑compose from the directory that holds the docker‑compose.yml (and the script) or change the source side of the bind‑mount to an absolute or correctly‑relative path (for example ${PWD}/mongo‑init.js or ../custom_no_tool/mongo‑init.js depending on where you invoke the command). Adding a top‑level `version: "3.9"` key is also recommended so Compose parses the file unambiguously. Once the mount points to a real file, the containers start normally and the health‑check can succeed.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: To fix the termination error, first verify that the `nginx.conf` file actually exists at the path relative to the compose file and that the compose file is being run from the directory that contains the `nginx.conf` folder; if the file is in a different location, adjust the volume bind to point to the correct absolute or relative path (for example `./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro`). Next, make sure the `webui-aria2` service is exposing the port that the UI actually listens on (the default web UI runs on port 8080, not 6800, which is the RPC port), so change the port mapping to something like `"8080:8080"` and update the proxy URL in `nginx.conf` to `http://webui-aria2:8080`. Finally, ensure the compose file uses proper indentation and that there are no stray characters; after these corrections `docker compose up` should pull the images and start both containers without build‑time failures.
