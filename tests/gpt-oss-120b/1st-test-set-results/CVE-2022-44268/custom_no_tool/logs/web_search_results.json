    "desc": "CVE\u20112022\u201144268 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick that allows an attacker who can supply a crafted PNG image to cause ImageMagick to read any file that the ImageMagick process can access on the host filesystem. The arbitrary file read occurs because ImageMagick incorrectly processes PNG \"tEXt\"/profile chunks and embeds the raw bytes of the referenced file into the output image metadata. An attacker can therefore obtain the contents of sensitive files such as /etc/passwd, configuration files, private keys, or any other readable file, leading to a high\u2011impact information disclosure. The flaw is present in default ImageMagick packages shipped with Ubuntu 22.04 and earlier LTS releases and is triggered during ordinary image\u2011processing operations such as convert, resize, or thumbnail generation.",
