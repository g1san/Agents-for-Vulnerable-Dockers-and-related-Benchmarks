    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u201112794 is a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in Django\u2019s technical 500 debug error page. When the Django setting DEBUG is enabled, the debug page renders exception information without proper HTML escaping. An attacker who can trigger an exception that includes attacker\u2011controlled data (for example via request parameters that cause a database error) can inject malicious JavaScript into the debug page, which is then executed in the browser of anyone viewing the page. The flaw exists in Django 1.10.x prior to 1.10.8 and Django 1.11.x prior to 1.11.5. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading Django to a patched version or by disabling DEBUG in production.",
