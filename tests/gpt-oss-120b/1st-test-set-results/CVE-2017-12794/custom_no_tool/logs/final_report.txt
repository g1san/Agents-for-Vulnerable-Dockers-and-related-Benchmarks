----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2017‑12794 is a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in Django’s technical 500 debug error page. When the Django setting DEBUG is enabled, the debug page renders exception information without proper HTML escaping. An attacker who can trigger an exception that includes attacker‑controlled data (for example via request parameters that cause a database error) can inject malicious JavaScript into the debug page, which is then executed in the browser of anyone viewing the page. The flaw exists in Django 1.10.x prior to 1.10.8 and Django 1.11.x prior to 1.11.5. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading Django to a patched version or by disabling DEBUG in production.
Attack Type: cross site scripting
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][django][['1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.10.3', '1.10.4', '1.10.5', '1.10.6', '1.10.7', '1.11.0', '1.11.1', '1.11.2', '1.11.3', '1.11.4']] The vulnerable Django framework version that provides the debug error page where the cross site scripting flaw resides.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13']] A database backend used to generate exception messages that can include attacker‑controlled data, enabling the exploit of the vulnerable Django debug page.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image is based on node:10-alpine and runs a Node.js application. It does not include Django nor PostgreSQL services, so the required services list ['django','postgres'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, there is no Django dependency in the code or image, therefore no vulnerable Django version from the provided list is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- ERROR: The Docker image is based on node:10-alpine and runs a Node.js application. It does not include Django nor PostgreSQL services, so the required services list ['django','postgres'] is not satisfied (services_ok = false). Additionally, there is no Django dependency in the code or image, therefore no vulnerable Django version from the provided list is used (code_hard_version = false).
	- FIX: To satisfy the required services you should add a Django service to the compose file using a base image that provides a patched version (for example python:3.8‑slim with Django 1.11.5 or later) and a PostgreSQL service (such as postgres:13) so the stack contains both [HARD][django] and [SOFT‑DB][postgres]. Replace the Node.js application with a minimal Django project that disables DEBUG in production (set DEBUG=False in settings.py) and relies on the database for any needed data, thereby eliminating the reflected‑XSS path that appears only when DEBUG is true. If you still need to keep the Node component, run it in a separate service and let the Django service be the primary vulnerable target, ensuring the compose file declares all three services and links them appropriately. This change brings the environment into compliance with the specified service list and removes the insecure debug page.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the container looks for /entrypoint.sh at the root of the filesystem, but the script is copied into /usr/src/app by the COPY . . command and isn’t marked executable. Change the Dockerfile’s ENTRYPOINT line to point to the script’s actual location (for example ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"] or ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/src/app/entrypoint.sh"]) and add a RUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh step after the copy so the script can be executed. With the correct path and execution permission the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the slim Python base image doesn’t contain the native libraries required to compile the psycopg2‑binary wheel, so the pip install step aborts. To repair it, edit the Dockerfile to install the prerequisite packages (e.g., gcc, libpq-dev, musl-dev or build‑essential and postgresql‑client) before running pip install, and then clean them up afterward to keep the image small. A minimal change looks like adding an apt‑get run that updates the package index, installs the build tools and libpq headers, executes the pip install command, and finally removes the temporary packages (or uses --no‑install‑recommendations to keep the layer lean). After that the rest of the Docker‑compose stack – migrations, health‑check, and server start – will build and run normally.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Django 1.11.4 isn’t compatible with the Python 3.8 base image you’re using, so the installation step crashes when the package’s dependencies are compiled. Update the project’s requirements.txt to a supported, patched release of Django (for example Django==1.11.29 or a newer 2.x/3.x version) and then rebuild the image; the newer Django releases also contain the fix for CVE‑2017‑12794. After the version bump, the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step will succeed, the rest of the Dockerfile can run unchanged, and the container will start with DEBUG already disabled, eliminating the XSS risk.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `entrypoint.sh` script waits for PostgreSQL with the `pg_isready` command, but the `python:3.8‑slim` base image does not include the PostgreSQL client utilities, so the command cannot be found and the container exits while Docker is still trying to finish the image build. To fix this, modify the `app/Dockerfile` to install the `postgresql-client` (or `postgresql-client‑13`) package together with the other build‑time dependencies, then keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged. After adding a line such as `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client && \` (still inside the same `RUN` statement that installs `gcc` and `libpq-dev`), the `pg_isready` utility will be available, the wait loop in `entrypoint.sh` will succeed, and the image will build and start correctly. No other code changes are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that fails is the **django_app** service – the problem is caused by the entry‑point script not being able to reach PostgreSQL long enough to finish the migrations, which makes the container exit with a non‑zero status. The fix is to make the wait‑loop a little more tolerant and to guarantee that the script is really executable inside the image. Edit **app/entrypoint.sh** so that it uses the built‑in `postgres` client that you already installed, strips any Windows line‑breaks, and adds a short timeout after each failed check; also keep the `chmod +x` line (it’s already there) but move the script copy **after** the system packages are installed so the binary is definitely in the PATH. The updated script looks like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

# Give PostgreSQL a few seconds to start up, retry until it is ready
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
    if pg_isready -h postgres -U django -d django_db >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "PostgreSQL is ready"
        break
    fi
    echo "Waiting for PostgreSQL... ($i/30)"
    sleep 2
done

# Fail fast if the DB never became ready
pg_isready -h postgres -U django -d django_db >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "PostgreSQL did not become ready in time"
    exit 1
}

# Apply migrations and optional fixture
python manage.py migrate --noinput
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json || true

# Finally start the development server
exec python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Save the file with Unix line endings (LF) and rebuild the image (`docker compose build django_app && docker compose up -d`). After this change the Django container will successfully wait for PostgreSQL, run its migrations, and stay up, eliminating the start‑up failure.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Django container likely fails during the `collectstatic` step because the `STATIC_ROOT` directory doesn’t exist yet, so the command aborts and the container exits; to fix it, add a `RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app/static` line in the Dockerfile before the `RUN python manage.py collectstatic …` command (or run the same `mkdir` just before the collectstatic command) so the target folder is present, then rebuild the image and restart the compose stack. This ensures the static files are collected successfully and the container can launch the development server without crashing.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Django application uses Django==1.11.29 as specified in requirements.txt, which is not in the vulnerable version list (1.10.x and 1.11.0‑1.11.4). Therefore the code does not use a vulnerable HARD version. Both required services (django_app based on Django and postgres) are present in the docker‑compose configuration, so the services requirement is satisfied.
	- ERROR: The Django application uses Django==1.11.29 as specified in requirements.txt, which is not in the vulnerable version list (1.10.x and 1.11.0‑1.11.4). Therefore the code does not use a vulnerable HARD version. Both required services (django_app based on Django and postgres) are present in the docker‑compose configuration, so the services requirement is satisfied.
	- FIX: To eliminate the reflected‑XSS issue you simply need to guarantee that the vulnerable debug page can never be rendered: keep DEBUG set to False in all environments (do not override it with an environment variable) and, as an extra safety net, upgrade the project’s Django dependency to a version that is not affected, such as Django 1.11.5 or newer (the latest 1.11.x release or any 2.x+ release). In practice this means changing the requirements.txt entry to Django>=1.11.5 and rebuilding the image, while leaving the existing DEBUG=False setting intact so that even if an exception occurs the error page will be safely templated without exposing unescaped data.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `entrypoint.sh` script relies on the `seq` utility, which isn’t included in the `python:3.8‑slim` base image, so the container aborts when it tries to execute the loop that waits for PostgreSQL. To fix this, rewrite the waiting loop so it doesn’t depend on `seq`—for example, replace the `for i in $(seq 1 30); do … done` construct with a simple counter loop (`i=1; while [ $i -le 30 ]; do … i=$((i+1)); done`) or install the `coreutils` package that provides `seq`. Updating the script in this way eliminates the missing‑command error and allows the image to build and start successfully.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
