    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20113704, also known as \u201cDrupalgeddon\u201d, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal 7 core. The flaw resides in the expandArguments() function of Drupal\u2019s database abstraction layer. By providing specially crafted array keys in a request to the Drupal web application, an unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary SQL statements. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to modify the users table, create a new administrator account, enable the PHP filter module and execute arbitrary PHP code, resulting in complete compromise of the web server and the underlying system.",
