CVE description: CVE-2021-35042 is a critical vulnerability in the Django web framework (Python package `django`). The flaw resides in the `QuerySet.order_by()` method, which fails to properly sanitise field names that are supplied from untrusted client input. When a view forwards a request parameter directly to `order_by()`, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL fragments into the generated `ORDER BY` clause. This results in a classic SQL injection (CWE‑89) that can be exploited without authentication. Exploitation allows an attacker to read, modify, or delete any data accessible to the database connection, potentially dumping credential hashes, enumerating the schema, or performing further database‑level attacks. The vulnerability affects all supported Django 3.1.x releases prior to 3.1.13 and all Django 3.2.x releases prior to 3.2.5. It was introduced as a regression in Django 3.1 while deprecating a code path, and was fixed in Django 3.1.13 and 3.2.5.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][python][['3.9-slim']] Container running a Django application that includes the vulnerable Django versions: 3.0a1 through 3.0.12, 3.1a1 through 3.1.12, and 3.2a1 through 3.2.4. The vulnerability is triggered by a view that passes a request's `order_by` parameter directly to `QuerySet.order_by()`.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['13']] Relational database used by the Django application to store data. PostgreSQL is required because the exploit demonstrated for this CVE relies on PostgreSQL's ability to execute multiple statements in a single query.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the web Dockerfile tries to copy ../app which lies outside the web build context – Docker will reject any “../” paths for security reasons. To fix it, change the web service’s build definition to use the repository root (or a directory that contains both web and app) as its context and then adjust the COPY lines in web/Dockerfile to reference the correct relative paths (for example, COPY app /usr/share/nginx/html instead of COPY ../app …). After the context is expanded, the image will build successfully; you can then optionally replace the insecure index.php logic with proper input validation or remove it altogether.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running (status "running"), but the Django application fails to start because it cannot connect to the PostgreSQL database. The logs show a psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "db" (172.18.0.2), port 5432 failed: Connection refused. This prevents migrations and server startup, indicating the container is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is running (status "running"), but the Django application fails to start because it cannot connect to the PostgreSQL database. The logs show a psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "db" (172.18.0.2), port 5432 failed: Connection refused. This prevents migrations and server startup, indicating the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: To fix the startup failure, adjust the web service so it waits until PostgreSQL is accepting connections—add a health‑check on the db container (or use a lightweight “wait‑for‑db” script in the web entrypoint) and make the web service depend on that health status; also ensure the Django container runs the migrations before launching the server (e.g., change the CMD to run `python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`). With the database ready and the schema applied, the web app will be able to connect to the `db` host and start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is running but its main process (wait-for-db.sh) is stuck in a loop waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432. The logs only contain repeated 'Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432...' messages and no indication that the web service has started, suggesting the container is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is running but its main process (wait-for-db.sh) is stuck in a loop waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432. The logs only contain repeated 'Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432...' messages and no indication that the web service has started, suggesting the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The loop never exits because pg_isready is trying to connect without a password, so the authentication check always fails and the script keeps printing “Waiting for PostgreSQL…”. Add the password to the check (or export PGPASSWORD) and include the database name so the health probe can succeed; for example, change the script to export PGPASSWORD="${DB_PASSWORD:-demopass}" before the until line and call pg_isready with -U "$DB_USER" ‑d "$DB_NAME". Once the ready check succeeds the script will run the migrations and start the Django server, fixing the stuck container.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is repeatedly logging "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." and never proceeds past the wait‑for‑db script. Although Docker reports the container as running, it is stuck waiting for the database and therefore not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is repeatedly logging "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." and never proceeds past the wait‑for‑db script. Although Docker reports the container as running, it is stuck waiting for the database and therefore not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The loop never sees PostgreSQL because the script is checking the wrong host/port – the `DB_HOST` variable isn’t being populated when the container starts, so it falls back to the empty default and `pg_isready` can’t connect. The fix is to make sure the environment variables are exported before the script runs (e.g., move the `environment:` block from the compose file into the Dockerfile’s `ENV` section or source a `.env` file in `wait‑for‑db.sh`), and hard‑code the host to the service name “db” inside the script (replace `host=${DB_HOST:-db}` with `host=db`). Once the script uses the correct host name, `pg_isready` will succeed, the migrations will run, and the Django server will start.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state but its logs show it is continuously looping with "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." and never progresses beyond the wait‑for‑db script. This indicates that the web service cannot connect to the PostgreSQL instance, so the container is not operating correctly even though Docker reports it as running.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state but its logs show it is continuously looping with "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." and never progresses beyond the wait‑for‑db script. This indicates that the web service cannot connect to the PostgreSQL instance, so the container is not operating correctly even though Docker reports it as running.
	- FIX: The loop never exits because the script is checking the wrong target – it always asks pg_isready to connect to the “demo” database as user demo, but the PostgreSQL container starts with the default “postgres” database first, so the readiness probe never succeeds. Fix it by editing **wait‑for‑db.sh** to use the environment‑provided values and to wait for the PostgreSQL service itself (or the default “postgres” database) instead of the specific “demo” DB, for example:

```sh
host="${DB_HOST:-db}"
port="${DB_PORT:-5432}"
user="${DB_USER:-demo}"
dbname="${DB_NAME:-postgres}"   # wait for the server, not the app DB
until pg_isready -h "$host" -p "$port" -U "$user" -d "$dbname" >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    echo "Waiting for PostgreSQL at $host:$port..."
    sleep 2
done
```

After the server is up you can then run the migrations against the real “demo” database (the `python manage.py migrate` command will connect to the DB you configured in Django settings). This change lets the web container break out of the wait loop and start the Django server correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state but its logs show it is repeatedly printing "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." and never proceeds to start the main service. This indicates it cannot reach the dependent PostgreSQL instance and therefore is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state but its logs show it is repeatedly printing "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." and never proceeds to start the main service. This indicates it cannot reach the dependent PostgreSQL instance and therefore is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The script is waiting for PostgreSQL to respond on the *demo* database but it’s probing the default “postgres” DB, so pg_isready never succeeds (the “demo” DB isn’t created until the container starts). Change the readiness test to use the actual database name passed via DB_NAME (or simply omit -d so it checks the server itself), e.g.:

```sh
dbname="${DB_NAME:-demo}"
until pg_isready -h "$host" -p "$port" -U "$user" -d "$dbname" >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    …
done
```

or drop -d altogether. After that the script will detect the DB, run the migrations, and start Django. Ensure the wait‑for‑db.sh file is executable (chmod +x) and that the DB_NAME environment variable matches the name defined in docker‑compose.yml (“demo”). With these small adjustments the web container will connect to the PostgreSQL service and start correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container state shows it is running, but the logs consist solely of repeated "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." messages, indicating the entrypoint script is stuck waiting for the database to become reachable. The main application never starts, so the container is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The container state shows it is running, but the logs consist solely of repeated "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." messages, indicating the entrypoint script is stuck waiting for the database to become reachable. The main application never starts, so the container is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The loop never succeeds because the readiness probe inside `wait‑for‑db.sh` is trying to reach PostgreSQL without the password that `pg_isready` needs, so the command always returns a non‑zero status and the script keeps printing “Waiting for PostgreSQL…”. Fix it by exporting the password **before** invoking `pg_isready` (or by passing the password with the `-w`/`-d` options) and by targeting the correct database. For example, change the script to:

```sh
export PGPASSWORD="${DB_PASSWORD:-demopass}"
host="${DB_HOST:-db}"
port="${DB_PORT:-5432}"
user="${DB_USER:-demo}"
db="${DB_NAME:-demo}"
until pg_isready -h "$host" -p "$port" -U "$user" -d "$db" >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    echo "Waiting for PostgreSQL at $host:$port..."
    sleep 2
done
```

Alternatively, remove the `condition: service_healthy` from the `depends_on` block so the web container doesn’t wait on a health‑check that fails, but the core fix is to supply the password to `pg_isready` so the script can detect when the DB is truly ready and proceed to run migrations and start Django.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is in a running state but its logs show an endless loop of "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." without any further progress or error messages. This indicates that the entrypoint script is still waiting for the database service to become reachable, so the application inside the container has not started correctly. As a result the container is not operating as expected.
	- ERROR: The container is in a running state but its logs show an endless loop of "Waiting for PostgreSQL at db:5432..." without any further progress or error messages. This indicates that the entrypoint script is still waiting for the database service to become reachable, so the application inside the container has not started correctly. As a result the container is not operating as expected.
	- FIX: The loop is happening because the wait‑for‑db.sh script tries to run pg_isready, but the python:3.9‑slim image doesn’t include the PostgreSQL client utilities, so the readiness check never succeeds. To fix it, add the client package (for example apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y postgresql-client) in the Dockerfile after the FROM line (or replace the pg_isready call with a simple psql -c "\q" probe that uses the same PGPASSWORD environment variable). Once the readiness binary is available, the script will detect the DB, run the migrations, and start the Django server as intended.
