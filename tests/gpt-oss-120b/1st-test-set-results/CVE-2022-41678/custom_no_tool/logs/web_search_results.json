    "desc": "CVE-2022-41678 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x. The flaw resides in the Jolokia HTTP endpoint (/api/jolokia) that is embedded in the ActiveMQ web console. An authenticated attacker who can access the Jolokia API can send a specially crafted JSON request that triggers the Jolokia ExecHandler to invoke Java Management Extensions operations. By abusing the Java Flight Recorder MXBean (or Log4j\u2019s JMX capabilities) the attacker can write arbitrary files to the broker\u2019s file system, read any file, perform server\u2011side request forgery, and ultimately upload and execute a malicious JSP web\u2011shell. This results in full remote code execution on the host running ActiveMQ. The vulnerability is present in ActiveMQ versions 5.16.0 through 5.16.5 and 5.17.0 through 5.17.3. Versions 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, 6.0.0 and later contain mitigations that restrict or disable the vulnerable Jolokia actions.",
