    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201116509 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter. The flaw lies in the handling of the PostScript \\`/invalidaccess\\` exception and the \\`-dSAFER\\` safety sandbox. When Ghostscript processes a specially crafted PostScript or EPS file, the sandbox can be bypassed and the \\`%pipe%\\` operator can be used to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. The vulnerability affects all Ghostscript releases prior to version 9.24. An attacker who can supply a malicious document to any service that invokes Ghostscript (for example, an image\u2011processing web application that uses Pillow to convert EPS files) can gain full control of the host, read or modify data, and pivot to other systems. The issue is fixed in Ghostscript 9.24 and later; mitigation also includes restricting network access to services that invoke Ghostscript and validating/sanitizing all incoming PostScript content.",
