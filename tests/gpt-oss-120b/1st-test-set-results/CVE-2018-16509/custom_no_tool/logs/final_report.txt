CVE description: CVE‑2018‑16509 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript interpreter. The flaw lies in the handling of the PostScript \`/invalidaccess\` exception and the \`-dSAFER\` safety sandbox. When Ghostscript processes a specially crafted PostScript or EPS file, the sandbox can be bypassed and the \`%pipe%\` operator can be used to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. The vulnerability affects all Ghostscript releases prior to version 9.24. An attacker who can supply a malicious document to any service that invokes Ghostscript (for example, an image‑processing web application that uses Pillow to convert EPS files) can gain full control of the host, read or modify data, and pivot to other systems. The issue is fixed in Ghostscript 9.24 and later; mitigation also includes restricting network access to services that invoke Ghostscript and validating/sanitizing all incoming PostScript content.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ghostscript][['9.23', '9.22', '9.21', '9.20', '9.19', '9.18', '9.17', '9.16', '9.15', '9.14', '9.13', '9.12', '9.11', '9.10', '9.9', '9.8', '9.7', '9.6', '9.5', '9.4', '9.3', '9.2', '9.1', '9.0']] Core Ghostscript interpreter that contains the vulnerable -dSAFER bypass. Versions prior to 9.24 are required for the system to be vulnerable to CVE‑2018‑16509.
- [SOFT-WEB][python][['3.9-slim']] Base image for a minimal Flask web application that uses the Pillow library to process image uploads. Pillow calls Ghostscript when handling EPS files, providing the execution path for the exploit.
Expected 'HARD' dependencies service not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile references a non‑existent or mismatched base image (vulhub/struts2:2.3.5) that has nothing to do with the Ghostscript vulnerability, and the image likely does not contain the required Ghostscript binaries, causing the build to abort when the later steps try to invoke them. To fix it, replace the base image with one that actually provides Ghostscript ≤ 9.23 (for example, `ubuntu:20.04` or `debian:stable-slim`) and add a few RUN commands that install the appropriate Ghostscript package version from the distribution’s repositories or via a direct .deb download. The Dockerfile should start with `FROM ubuntu:20.04` (or similar), then `RUN apt‑update && apt‑install -y ghostscript=9.22*` (or use `apt‑install -y ghostscript` on a distro whose default version is still below 9.24), followed by copying your vulnerable application code and exposing port 8080. With a valid base image and Ghostscript installed, the compose file will build successfully.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Pillow needs system libraries that aren’t present in the slim‑buster image, so the pip install step aborts; to fix it you should extend the apt‑get line to also install the image libraries required by Pillow (for example libjpeg62‑turbo‑dev, zlib1g‑dev and libopenjp2‑7‑dev) before running pip, and then clean the apt cache as you already do. After adding those packages the Ghostscript package installs fine and the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile installs Ghostscript from the Debian bullseye repository without pinning a version. The version in bullseye is newer (≈9.55) and is not included in the vulnerable version list (9.0‑9.23). Hence the image does not use a vulnerable Ghostscript version, causing the code_hard_version milestone to fail. The required services (ghostscript and python) are present, so services_ok passes.

	- FIX: To make the image use a vulnerable Ghostscript you must install a specific 9.x release instead of the default package from bullseye. Replace the generic `apt-get install ghostscript` line with a step that downloads the exact 9.22 .deb (for example from snapshot.debian.org) and installs it with `dpkg -i` or pins the version via `apt-get install ghostscript=9.22*`. After adding the version‑specific install you should clean the apt cache as before, so the container now contains Ghostscript 9.22 and the “code_hard_version” check will pass.


Docker is running correctly with 1 containers!
