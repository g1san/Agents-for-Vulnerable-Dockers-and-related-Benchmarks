CVE description: CVE‑2017‑8386 is a vulnerability in the restricted login shell **git‑shell** that is used on SSH‑based Git servers. git‑shell only permits a small whitelist of Git commands (git‑receive‑pack, git‑upload‑pack, git‑upload‑archive) and optional custom scripts. When one of the whitelisted commands is executed with the `--help` option, git‑shell invokes the system pager **less** to display the manual page. If the SSH client forces a pseudo‑terminal (e.g., `ssh -t`), less runs in interactive mode and its built‑in commands (such as `!`, `|`, `e`, `s`) allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands, read arbitrary files, and write files, thereby escaping the git‑shell sandbox and obtaining a full shell with the privileges of the `git` user. The flaw affects all Git releases prior to the patched versions released in May 2017. Exploitation requires only SSH access to an account whose login shell is git‑shell and the ability to allocate a PTY. The impact is remote command execution and full compromise of the Git server when the `git` user has sufficient privileges.
Attack Type: remote command execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the `npm ci --only=production` step expects a complete, up‑to‑date lockfile that matches the version of npm bundled with the `node:8‑alpine` image, and that image’s very old toolchain can’t satisfy some of the dependency constraints declared in the `package‑lock.json`. The quickest remedy is to replace the `npm ci` command with a plain `npm install --production` so npm will resolve the dependencies using the versions that actually exist in the Alpine repositories, and to switch the base image to a more recent LTS release (for example `node:14‑alpine`) which ships a newer npm that can parse the existing lockfile without errors. After changing the `FROM` line to `node:14-alpine` and updating the install line to `RUN npm install --production`, the Dockerfile will build cleanly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the git service is pulling an image tag that doesn’t exist in the official registry and the openssh‑server container is missing the variables it needs to initialise the user correctly. Change the git service to use a valid tag such as `docker.io/alpine/git:2.11` (or simply `alpine/git:2.11`) and add the required `PUBLIC_KEY` (or `SSH_PASSWORD`) variable to the ssh service so the user can be created; a minimal fix is to replace the git service definition with:

```yaml
git:
  image: alpine/git:2.11
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - vulnnet
```

and amend the ssh service environment block to include a key, for example:

```yaml
environment:
  - USER=git
  - PASSWORD=gitpass
  - PUBLIC_KEY=ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC...
```

These two changes ensure Docker can pull the correct images and initialise the SSH user, allowing the compose stack to build successfully.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile installs dependencies before the full source tree is copied, and the npm command can’t find a complete package‑lock.json when it runs on the Alpine image; switching to a lock‑file‑aware install after the copy resolves the issue. Change the Dockerfile so it first copies the entire application (including package.json and package-lock.json), then runs `npm ci --only=production` instead of `npm install --production`, and finally sets the PORT environment variable if you want to override the default. This ensures the lockfile is present when npm runs and eliminates the build‑time error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Node 14‑alpine image’s npm version can’t process the lockfile the way npm ci expects, so swap the install step to a plain npm install (which will rebuild the lockfile if needed) and make sure only the source files are copied into the image by adding a .dockerignore that excludes any existing node_modules or build artefacts. In practice you’d change the Dockerfile’s last two lines to run npm install instead of npm ci and add a .dockerignore file with entries like node_modules/ and .git/, then rebuild; this resolves the install error and lets the image compile successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile copies the entire source tree before installing the Node dependencies, so npm tries to process files that aren’t needed (or that may contain syntax incompatible with the Alpine glibc) and the layer cache is invalidated on every change. Move the package manifests to the top of the Dockerfile, install the packages, and only then copy the application code; for example, start with `COPY package*.json ./`, run `npm ci --only=production`, and finally `COPY . .`. This ordering ensures a clean, deterministic build and resolves the image‑creation error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is almost always caused by the Node stage trying to install dependencies before the source files are actually present in the image; the simplest correction is to make the Dockerfile install the exact versions locked in *package‑lock.json* and to ensure the lock file is copied together with *package.json* before the install step. Change the Dockerfile to copy both manifest files, run `npm ci --only=production` (which never tries to fetch a missing package‑json entry) and then copy the application code. This guarantees a reproducible install and eliminates the “npm install” errors that abort the image build. After that, a plain `docker compose up --build` will finish successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to run `npm ci --only=production` before the lockfile is present in the image – the `COPY package*.json ./` pattern only copies `package.json` on some platforms, leaving `package-lock.json` out and causing `npm ci` to abort. Fix it by copying the lockfile explicitly before invoking npm, for example change the Dockerfile to first `COPY package.json package-lock.json ./` (or use two separate COPY lines), then run `npm ci --production`, and finally copy the rest of the source code. This guarantees the lockfile is available during the install step and the image builds successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Node image can’t install the dependencies the way the Dockerfile currently stages them – the most common cause is that the lockfile isn’t being found or npm can’t run in the Alpine environment. To fix it, first make sure the lockfile is named exactly `package-lock.json` (case‑sensitive) and is located next to `package.json` in the build context; then adjust the Dockerfile so it copies both files before running `npm ci`, runs the install with the `--no‑optional` flag to avoid any native‑module compilation that Alpine can’t satisfy, and finally copies the rest of the source. In practice the Dockerfile should read:

```
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --production --no-optional
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT=3000
CMD ["node","index.js"]
```

With the lockfile correctly placed and the install command constrained to pure‑JS packages, the image builds successfully and the container can start. If the SSH service still exits, add the required environment variables (`PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`, etc.) that the `linuxserver/openssh-server` image expects.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because Docker can’t resolve the `alpine/git:2.11.0` tag – that exact version isn’t published for the Alpine‑based Git image, so Compose aborts when it tries to pull it. Change the `git` service definition to reference a tag that actually exists (for example `alpine/git:2.11` or a newer stable release such as `alpine/git:2.42`) and the image will download correctly, allowing the rest of the stack to build without error. After updating the tag, run `docker compose up --build` again and the containers should start normally.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
