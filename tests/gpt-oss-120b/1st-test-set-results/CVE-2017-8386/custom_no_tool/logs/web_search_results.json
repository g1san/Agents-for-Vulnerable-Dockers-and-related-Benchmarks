    "desc": "CVE\u20112017\u20118386 is a vulnerability in the restricted login shell **git\u2011shell** that is used on SSH\u2011based Git servers. git\u2011shell only permits a small whitelist of Git commands (git\u2011receive\u2011pack, git\u2011upload\u2011pack, git\u2011upload\u2011archive) and optional custom scripts. When one of the whitelisted commands is executed with the `--help` option, git\u2011shell invokes the system pager **less** to display the manual page. If the SSH client forces a pseudo\u2011terminal (e.g., `ssh -t`), less runs in interactive mode and its built\u2011in commands (such as `!`, `|`, `e`, `s`) allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands, read arbitrary files, and write files, thereby escaping the git\u2011shell sandbox and obtaining a full shell with the privileges of the `git` user. The flaw affects all Git releases prior to the patched versions released in May\u202f2017. Exploitation requires only SSH access to an account whose login shell is git\u2011shell and the ability to allocate a PTY. The impact is remote command execution and full compromise of the Git server when the `git` user has sufficient privileges.",
