----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2019‑11581 is a server‑side template injection vulnerability in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. The public “Contact Administrators” form and the administrative “Send Bulk Mail” function accept a subject (or message) parameter that is processed by the Velocity/FreeMarker template engine without proper sanitisation. An attacker can supply a crafted template expression that is evaluated on the server, causing arbitrary operating‑system commands to be executed with the privileges of the Jira process. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication when the Contact Administrators form is enabled, or by an authenticated administrator for the Send Bulk Mail endpoint. Affected Jira releases span from version 4.4.0 up to, but not including, the fixed releases 7.6.14, 7.13.5, 8.0.3, 8.1.2 and 8.2.3. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full remote code execution on the host running Jira, allowing complete system compromise.

	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the vulnerable‑dind service up you should give it a persistent Docker storage area and make sure it can actually start the Docker daemon on the exposed TCP socket. Edit the compose file so the service definition includes a bind‑mount (or named volume) for /var/lib/docker, for example adding a volumes section under the service:

    vulnerable-dind:
      image: docker:18.09.9-dind
      privileged: true
      ports:
        - "2375:2375"
      environment:
        - DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=
      command: ["--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]
      volumes:
        - dind-data:/var/lib/docker

Then declare the volume at the bottom of the file:

    volumes:
      dind-data:

Optionally bump the base image to a newer, still vulnerable tag (e.g., docker:19.03-dind) if the older one fails to run on your host kernel. After saving the file, run docker-compose up -d again; the container should now start correctly and expose the Docker daemon on port 2375.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker reports the container state as running, but the logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that Tomcat could not create the required deployment directory, which typically prevents the application from being deployed correctly. Consequently the container is not operating as expected despite being in a running state.
	- ERROR: Docker reports the container state as running, but the logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that Tomcat could not create the required deployment directory, which typically prevents the application from being deployed correctly. Consequently the container is not operating as expected despite being in a running state.
	- FIX: Set the jira service to mount a host directory that the container can write to (for example ./jira-data instead of an anonymous volume) and make sure that directory exists on the host with permissions allowing the jira user (uid 2000) to create sub‑folders. You can also add a command that creates the missing /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost path before Tomcat starts, such as sh -c "mkdir -p /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost && chown -R jira:jira /opt/atlassian/jira && /entrypoint.sh". Finally, remove the privileged setting from the vulnerable-dind service if it isn’t needed, as it can interfere with volume permissions. After recreating the containers with the corrected volume mount and proper ownership, Tomcat will be able to create the deployment directory and the Jira container will start correctly.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack fails to start is that the `vulnerable-dind` service is trying to run Docker in‑Docker without the required privileges, so the Docker daemon inside the container cannot bind to the TCP socket and crashes, which in turn prevents the dependent services from initializing correctly. Add the `privileged: true` flag (or at least bind‑mount `/var/run/docker.sock` if you prefer socket sharing) to the `vulnerable-dind` definition, and make sure the Docker socket is exposed in the compose file. After that, rebuild and bring the stack up again; the other containers (Postgres, Jira, Nginx) will be able to start normally. If Jira still has start‑up issues, ensure the host directory `./jira-data` exists and is writable by the `jira` user (or set `JIRA_HOME=/var/atlassian/application-data/jira` explicitly), but fixing the privileged flag on the DIND container usually resolves the immediate launch failure.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: Check the container logs to see why it stops; most likely the Jira service is failing because the PostgreSQL database isn’t ready when it starts. Add a healthcheck for the postgres service and make the jira service wait for the database to become healthy, for example by adding a simple “pg_isready” command in the postgres definition and changing the jira depends_on entry to include condition: service_healthy. Also give each service a restart policy such as restart: unless‑stopped so they automatically come back up after a failure. This small change ensures the database is up before Jira tries to connect and keeps the containers running.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container state reports it is running, but the JIRA startup logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that the Tomcat instance could not create a required deployment directory, which typically prevents the application from fully initializing. Although the process stays up, the service is not started correctly, so the container is not functioning as expected.
	- ERROR: The container state reports it is running, but the JIRA startup logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that the Tomcat instance could not create a required deployment directory, which typically prevents the application from fully initializing. Although the process stays up, the service is not started correctly, so the container is not functioning as expected.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the Jira container expects to write its Tomcat configuration under /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost, but the image is launched without a writable filesystem at that path; the default user inside the container does not have permission to create the directory. To fix it, bind‑mount a host directory (or a named volume) to /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost or to the whole /opt/atlassian/jira/conf tree and ensure the mount point is owned by the UID/GID that the Jira process runs as (usually jira or daemon). Adding a volume entry such as ‑ ‑ conf-data:/opt/atlassian/jira/conf in docker‑compose.yml and creating the volume with the proper ownership (e.g. docker volume create --name conf-data && docker run --rm -v conf-data:/opt/atlassian/jira/conf ubuntu chown 1000:1000 /opt/atlassian/jira/conf) resolves the permission problem, allowing Tomcat to create the deployment directory and start Jira correctly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the Jira container won’t start in this stack is a permission mismatch on the host‑mounted ./jira-data directory – the image runs as UID 2000 but the directory is created by root, so the entry‑point chown fails and the service aborts. Change the bind‑mount to a named volume (or pre‑create the folder and chmod 777 it) and remove the chown step from the command block, or simply add user: "0:0" to the jira service so it runs as root and can write to the bind mount. After correcting the volume permissions (or switching to a named volume) and restarting the compose file, the Jira container should come up healthy and the rest of the stack will function.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that’s failing is most likely the PostgreSQL service – its health‑check is timing out because the database isn’t ready when Jira tries to start, causing the whole stack to block. Edit the docker‑compose.yml so the health‑check waits a bit longer (increase start_period to 30s or 60s) and make the check use the postgres user that you created instead of the default postgres user. For example, replace the health‑check block with:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "jira", "-d", "jira"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 30s
```

After raising the start_period the PostgreSQL container gets enough time to initialise, the service_healthy condition is satisfied, and Jira can connect successfully. Restart the stack (`docker compose up -d`) and the services should come up in the correct order.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker inspect output shows the container is in a running state, but the logs reveal a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that the JIRA application failed to create a necessary directory, which will prevent proper deployment of the webapp. Although the Tomcat server later reports "Server startup in 2879 ms", the earlier fatal error suggests the application did not start correctly, so the container is not running as intended.
	- ERROR: The Docker inspect output shows the container is in a running state, but the logs reveal a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that the JIRA application failed to create a necessary directory, which will prevent proper deployment of the webapp. Although the Tomcat server later reports "Server startup in 2879 ms", the earlier fatal error suggests the application did not start correctly, so the container is not running as intended.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the conf volume is mounted over /opt/atlassian/jira/conf and the container’s Atlassian user does not have write permission on the host‑created directory, so Tomcat cannot create Catalina/localhost. To fix it, either remove the conf-data volume so the container can manage its own configuration directory, or pre‑create the host directory with the correct ownership (uid 1000 gid 1000, matching the Atlassian user) before starting the compose stack. Updating the docker‑compose.yml to mount the volume as a bind‑mount with :cached and setting user: "1000:1000" on the jira service will also ensure the process can write the required path. After applying one of these changes, restart the stack and the JIRA webapp should deploy correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker inspect reports the container is in a running state, but the application logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that JIRA failed to complete its startup and cannot deploy properly, so the container is not running correctly.
	- ERROR: Docker inspect reports the container is in a running state, but the application logs contain a SEVERE error: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]". This indicates that JIRA failed to complete its startup and cannot deploy properly, so the container is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The error occurs because the Jira container is trying to write its Tomcat deployment descriptor under /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost, but that path is read‑only for the default “jira” user inside the image; the compose file only mounts a volume for /var/atlassian/application-data/jira, leaving the configuration directory unwritable. To fix it, add a writable bind‑mount (or named volume) that maps a host directory to /opt/atlassian/jira/conf and make sure the directory is owned by the UID/GID that the container uses (or change the ownership on startup with a chown command). Alternatively, set the environment variable ATL_TOMCAT_HOME to point to a subdirectory inside /var/atlassian/application-data/jira so that Tomcat writes its deployment files to a location that is already persisted and writable. After updating the compose file with the extra volume (or the environment variable) and ensuring correct permissions, restart the stack and Jira should start without the “Unable to create directory for deployment” error.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): Docker reports the container is in a running state, but the application startup logs show critical failures. A SEVERE error occurs: "Unable to create directory for deployment: [/opt/atlassian/jira/conf/Catalina/localhost]", and the JIRA bootstrap indicates the database is not yet configured, enqueuing further launchers. These errors prevent JIRA/Tomcat from completing its initialization, meaning the service inside the container is not operating correctly.
