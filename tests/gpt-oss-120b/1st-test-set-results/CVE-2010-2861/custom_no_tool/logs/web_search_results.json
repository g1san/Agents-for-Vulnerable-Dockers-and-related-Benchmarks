    "desc": "CVE\u20112010\u20112861 is a directory\u2011traversal vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion Administrator console. The flaw resides in the `locale` parameter of several CFIDE administrative pages (e.g., `enter.cfm`, `settings/mappings.cfm`, `logging/settings.cfm`, `datasources/index.cfm`, `j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm`). When an attacker supplies a path\u2011traversal payload such as `../../../../WEB-INF/password.properties` (optionally terminated with a null byte), ColdFusion concatenates the unsanitized value with an internal file path and reads the requested file from the server\u2019s file system. The server then returns the file contents in the HTTP response, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to disclose arbitrary files, including the `password.properties` file that contains encrypted administrator credentials. The disclosed credentials can be reused directly to gain administrative access, after which the attacker can create scheduled tasks, upload web shells, and achieve full compromise of the ColdFusion application. The vulnerability affects multiple ColdFusion versions released before the APSB10\u201118 patch and is classified as a critical information disclosure issue.",
