CVE description: CVE‑2010‑2861 is a directory‑traversal vulnerability in the Adobe ColdFusion Administrator console. The flaw resides in the `locale` parameter of several CFIDE administrative pages (e.g., `enter.cfm`, `settings/mappings.cfm`, `logging/settings.cfm`, `datasources/index.cfm`, `j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm`). When an attacker supplies a path‑traversal payload such as `../../../../WEB-INF/password.properties` (optionally terminated with a null byte), ColdFusion concatenates the unsanitized value with an internal file path and reads the requested file from the server’s file system. The server then returns the file contents in the HTTP response, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to disclose arbitrary files, including the `password.properties` file that contains encrypted administrator credentials. The disclosed credentials can be reused directly to gain administrative access, after which the attacker can create scheduled tasks, upload web shells, and achieve full compromise of the ColdFusion application. The vulnerability affects multiple ColdFusion versions released before the APSB10‑18 patch and is classified as a critical information disclosure issue.
Attack Type: directory traversal leading to unauthorized file disclosure
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][adobe/coldfusion][['8.0', '8.0.1', '9.0', '9.0.1']] Adobe ColdFusion application server containing the vulnerable Administrator console; provides the `locale` parameter that can be abused for directory traversal.
- [SOFT-WEB][mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis][['windowsservercore-1809']] Web server that hosts the ColdFusion application; required to serve HTTP requests and deliver the vulnerable CFIDE endpoints.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile is based on the very old php:5.3‑apache image and then tries to install the obsolete libapache2-mod-php5 package, which no longer exists in the Debian repositories used by that image. To fix it, switch to a current, supported PHP‑Apache base (for example php:8.2-apache or any recent 8.x tag), remove the unnecessary apt‑get install line (the base image already includes the Apache‑PHP module), and keep the COPY statement that places your html files into /var/www/html/. After updating the base image and deleting the failing apt‑get command, the image will build successfully and the rest of the compose file can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition only builds a PHP‑Apache image (php:8.2-apache) and does not include either adobe/coldfusion or mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis, so the required services are missing, causing services_ok to be false. Since adobe/coldfusion is not present at all, no vulnerable ColdFusion version (8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, 9.0.1) is used, resulting in code_hard_version being false.

Since adobe/coldfusion is not present at all, no vulnerable ColdFusion version (8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, 9.0.1) is used, resulting in code_hard_version being false.
	- FIX: To resolve the mismatch you need to replace the current PHP‑Apache service with a container that actually runs Adobe ColdFusion and, if you want to keep the IIS front‑end, add a Windows Server Core/IIS service that proxies to the ColdFusion instance. In the docker‑compose.yml declare a coldfusion service that builds (or pulls) an image such as adobe/coldfusion:9.0 or an appropriate newer tag, expose the CFIDE ports (default 8500) and mount any required configuration files; then add an iis service using mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis that forwards HTTP traffic to the ColdFusion container (for example with ARR or a reverse‑proxy rule). Finally remove the PHP‑Apache build files, because they are irrelevant to the CVE‑2010‑2861 scenario, and ensure the compose file references only the two new services so that services_ok and code_hard_version evaluate to true.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to run a Linux‑based ColdFusion image together with a Windows Server Core IIS image in the same stack, which is only possible on a Windows Docker host; on a typical Linux host Docker will abort with a platform‑mismatch error. To fix it, either run the entire compose on a Windows host (add `platform: windows` to both services) or replace the Windows IIS container with a Linux‑based reverse‑proxy such as Nginx/Apache that can run on the same host as the ColdFusion image. If you keep IIS, add a `depends_on: coldfusion` line so the front‑end starts after ColdFusion, and make sure the `./iis/html` directory exists on the host before you launch the stack. After aligning the operating‑system platforms (or swapping IIS for a Linux proxy) the compose file will build and start without error.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile is trying to copy files that aren’t in the build context – the conf directory and the html directory must be sub‑folders of ./nginx (the folder referenced by context: ./nginx). Move conf/default.conf and the html tree into the ./nginx directory (or adjust the COPY lines to the correct relative paths), and add an EXPOSE 80 instruction so the image can listen on the expected port. After those path corrections the nginx image will build successfully and the compose stack will start.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The ColdFusion container is built FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine, not FROM adobe/coldfusion, so no Adobe ColdFusion version (8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, 9.0.1) is present. Consequently the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not satisfied. Additionally, the compose file defines only two custom services (coldfusion and nginx) and neither uses the advertised images 'adobe/coldfusion' nor 'mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis'. Therefore the 'services_ok' milestone is also not met.

Therefore the 'services_ok' milestone is also not met.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you need to replace the placeholder Dockerfile for the coldfusion service with one that builds FROM the official Adobe ColdFusion image (for example adobe/coldfusion:9.0 or the specific version you target) and expose the native CF admin port (usually 8500). Then update the docker‑compose.yml so that the coldfusion service uses that image (or builds from the revised Dockerfile) and remove the nginx container, adding an iis service that builds FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis or pulls that image directly; configure it to forward CFIDE requests to the ColdFusion container. Finally, adjust the ports and any required environment variables (e.g., CF_PASSWORD) so both services run with the correct images, which will meet the services_ok requirement.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the IIS Dockerfile tries to pull and run the Web Platform Installer (webpicmd.exe) inside a Windows‑Server‑Core image that isn’t pre‑loaded with the installer and the PowerShell commands are written as a single RUN line that breaks the Windows‑specific syntax; to fix it, replace the whole “Install‑Module / Install‑PackageProvider / webpicmd” block with a simple DISM‑based feature install for ARR and URL‑Rewrite (for example, `RUN Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server; RUN Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server, Web-Http-Redirect, Web-Static-Content;` followed by downloading the ARR and URL‑Rewrite MSI packages from Microsoft and installing them with `Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList '/i','arr.msi','/quiet','/norestart' -Wait` and the same for UrlRewrite.msi), and be sure to run the Docker build on a Windows host (or use a Linux‑based reverse‑proxy instead). After removing the failing PowerShell module commands and using the MSI installers (or the pre‑built `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:arr` image if available), the IIS image builds successfully and the compose stack starts as expected.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the IIS Dockerfile assumes a Windows container host and tries to run PowerShell commands that are not available when Docker is using Linux‑based engines; either run the compose file on a Windows‑container‑enabled host or replace the Windows base image with a Linux‑based IIS image (for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0` with the IIS module installed) and adjust the rewrite rules accordingly. If you keep the Windows image, add `platform: windows` to the ColdFusion service as well and make sure the Docker daemon is switched to Windows containers before invoking `docker‑compose up`. Removing the extra PowerShell module installations and using the built‑in WebPI package (`webpicmd.exe /Install /Products:ARR,UrlRewrite2 /AcceptEULA`) also reduces the chance of missing dependencies. After aligning the host platform with the image platform and simplifying the installer step, the images should build successfully.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the “iis” service is trying to run an Apache HTTPD image while the rest of the compose file expects a Windows‑based IIS container – the base image name, the module list and the file layout don’t match, so the copy of *conf/httpd.conf* can’t be applied and the proxy modules aren’t found. To fix it, replace the line `FROM httpd:2.4` in *iis/Dockerfile* with the correct Windows IIS base, for example `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis`, and adjust the configuration copy to the IIS layout (e.g., copy the file to `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config` or use an IIS‑compatible rewrite rule). If you prefer to stay on Linux, rename the service to “apache” (both in the compose file and the container name) and keep the `httpd:2.4` base, but then change the exposed port mapping to match Apache (e.g., `8080:80`) and update the rewrite rule syntax to Apache’s `ProxyPass /CFIDE/ http://coldfusion:8500/CFIDE/`. Either approach aligns the image with the configuration and eliminates the build error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the IIS service is being built from a Windows‑only base image on a host that is not running Windows containers (or the image tag does not match the specified platform), so Docker cannot resolve the Windows layers and aborts the build. The quick fix is to make the Dockerfile and compose file explicit about the Windows variant you want and ensure the build is performed with a Windows‑compatible builder. Change the IIS Dockerfile to reference a concrete Windows Server Core tag that matches the platform you intend to use (for example `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-1809`) and add a `SHELL` directive so that subsequent commands are interpreted by `cmd.exe`. In the compose file, set the platform for the IIS service to `windows/amd64` (or the exact OS/arch you need) like `platform: windows/amd64`. If you are building on a Linux‑only Docker Engine, you must either switch to a Windows host or use Docker Desktop’s experimental buildx to create a multi‑platform builder that can pull Windows layers; otherwise replace the Windows IIS image with a Linux‑based reverse‑proxy (e.g., Nginx) that can perform the same URL‑rewrite. After these changes, the `docker compose build` command will locate a matching Windows base image, copy the site files correctly, and complete without errors.
