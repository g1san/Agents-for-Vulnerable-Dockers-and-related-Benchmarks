----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE-2021-41460 is a vulnerability in the ECShop e‑commerce platform version 4.1.0. The flaw is a classic SQL injection that exists in the core ECShop application code. An attacker can supply specially crafted input to vulnerable parameters (for example, in search or product‑listing queries) and cause the underlying MySQL database to execute arbitrary SQL statements. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete data stored in the ECShop database, including user credentials, personal information, and administrative data. Because ECShop is a web‑based application, the attack can be performed remotely over HTTP without needing authentication, leading to unauthorized data disclosure and potential full compromise of the e‑commerce site.
Attack Type: SQL injection
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][ecshop][['4.1.0']] The vulnerable ECShop application that contains the SQL‑injection flaw.
- [SOFT-WEB][php][['8.0-apache']] Provides the PHP runtime and Apache web server needed to host the ECShop application.
Expected 'SOFT' role(s) not proposed!

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not include an 'ecshop' service; only a PHP‑Apache application and a MySQL database are present. Consequently, there is no instance of ecshop to verify against the required version 4.1.0, so the 'code_hard_version' milestone fails. Additionally, the required services list ['ecshop', 'php'] is not fully satisfied because the ecshop component is missing, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail.

Additionally, the required services list ['ecshop', 'php'] is not fully satisfied because the ecshop component is missing, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to add an ECShop service that runs version 4.1.0 of the application, linking it to the existing MySQL container, and adjust the PHP service to use the same runtime as ECShop (PHP 8.0 with Apache). In the docker‑compose file you would declare a new service (e.g., ecshop) that builds from a Dockerfile based on php:8.0‑apache, copies the ECShop 4.1.0 source into /var/www/html, and sets the appropriate environment variables or volume mounts for the database connection; then you can remove or rename the generic “app” service so the required ['ecshop','php'] list is satisfied. Finally, ensure the MySQL container’s credentials match those expected by ECShop (e.g., user user, password userpass) so the application can connect on startup.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The `ecshop` service is built from `php:8.0-apache`, which does not match the required version `4.1.0` for the `ecshop` service, so the `code_hard_version` milestone fails. Additionally, the compose file defines only two services (`ecshop` and `db`). While the `ecshop` service uses a PHP image, there is no standalone `php` service defined, so the required list of services `['ecshop', 'php']` is not fully present, causing the `services_ok` milestone to fail.

While the `ecshop` service uses a PHP image, there is no standalone `php` service defined, so the required list of services `['ecshop', 'php']` is not fully present, causing the `services_ok` milestone to fail.
	- FIX: To satisfy the code_hard_version milestone you must replace the generic php:8.0‑apache base with a container that actually runs ECShop 4.1.0 – for example build a custom image that copies the ECShop 4.1.0 source into /var/www/html or pull an existing ECShop‑4.1.0 Docker image and reference it in the ecshop service’s image field instead of using php:8.0‑apache. Then, to meet the services_ok requirement, either add a distinct php service that runs the same PHP runtime (exposing the same code or acting as a shared runtime) and make ecshop depend on it, or rename the existing ecshop service to php and create a thin wrapper service called ecshop that points to the PHP container, ensuring both required service names appear in the compose file. After these two adjustments the compose file will contain the proper ECShop version and the full set of required services.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker image for the ecshop service (custom_no_tool-ecshop:latest) does not contain any metadata or label indicating the ECShop application version. The Dockerfile only copies the source code but does not tag the image with the required version (4.1.0). Therefore, we cannot verify that the ecshop service is using version 4.1.0, causing the code_hard_version milestone to fail. The compose file does include both the required 'ecshop' and 'php' services, so services_ok is true.

The Dockerfile only copies the source code but does not tag the image with the required version (4.1.0). Therefore, we cannot verify that the ecshop service is using version 4.1.0, causing the code_hard_version milestone to fail. The compose file does include both the required 'ecshop' and 'php' services, so services_ok is true.
	- FIX: Add a label (or environment variable) that records the ECShop version inside the ECShop image. For example, edit ./ecshop/Dockerfile to include a line such as `LABEL ecshop.version="4.1.0"` (or `ENV EC_SHOP_VERSION=4.1.0`) right after the `FROM php:8.0‑apache` statement. Then rebuild the image so the metadata is present; the compose file can keep using the same service definition, and the version‑checking step will be able to read the label and confirm that the container runs ECShop 4.1.0.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The ecshop service maps its internal Apache port 80 to host port 8080 ("8080:80"), which is not the default HTTP port 80. Therefore the service is not exposed on its default network port. The php service does not expose any ports, and the db service correctly uses the default MySQL port 3306, but because not all services are using their default ports, the network_setup milestone is not met.

The php service does not expose any ports, and the db service correctly uses the default MySQL port 3306, but because not all services are using their default ports, the network_setup milestone is not met.
	- FIX: To align the compose file with the default network ports, change the ecshop service mapping from `"8080:80"` to `"80:80"` so it listens on the standard HTTP port, and add a port mapping for the php service such as `"80:80"` (or expose it via the same network without publishing) if you need external access; the db service already uses the default MySQL port 3306, so no change is needed there. By publishing the services on their native ports the network_setup milestone will be satisfied.
