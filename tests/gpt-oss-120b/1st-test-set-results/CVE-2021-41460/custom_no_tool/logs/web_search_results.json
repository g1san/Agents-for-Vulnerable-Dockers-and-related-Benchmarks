{
    "desc": "CVE-2021-41460 is a vulnerability in the ECShop e\u2011commerce platform version 4.1.0. The flaw is a classic SQL injection that exists in the core ECShop application code. An attacker can supply specially crafted input to vulnerable parameters (for example, in search or product\u2011listing queries) and cause the underlying MySQL database to execute arbitrary SQL statements. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete data stored in the ECShop database, including user credentials, personal information, and administrative data. Because ECShop is a web\u2011based application, the attack can be performed remotely over HTTP without needing authentication, leading to unauthorized data disclosure and potential full compromise of the e\u2011commerce site.",
