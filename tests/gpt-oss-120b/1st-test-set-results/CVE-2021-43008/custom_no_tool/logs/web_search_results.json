    "desc": "CVE\u20112021\u201143008 is a vulnerability in the Adminer web\u2011based database management tool that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The flaw resides in the handling of the \u201cfile\u201d parameter (or the misuse of the LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE feature) which is not properly sanitized, enabling path\u2011traversal\u2011style access to any file readable by the web\u2011server process. An attacker can simply craft an HTTP request that includes a malicious file parameter, or connect Adminer to a malicious MySQL instance and trigger a LOAD DATA query that imports a chosen file into a table, then retrieve its contents. This results in disclosure of configuration files, source code, credential files, and any other sensitive data, facilitating further compromise of the affected system.",
