CVE description: CVE‑2020‑11981 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Airflow versions up to and including 1.10.10 when the CeleryExecutor is used. The Airflow scheduler and workers receive task payloads from an external message broker (Redis or RabbitMQ). Because the payloads are not properly validated, an attacker who can connect to the broker can publish a malicious message that is deserialized by a Celery worker. The worker then executes arbitrary operating‑system commands with the privileges of the Airflow process, allowing full compromise of the host running the Celflow worker and, consequently, the entire Airflow deployment.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/airflow][['1.10.0', '1.10.1', '1.10.2', '1.10.3', '1.10.4', '1.10.5', '1.10.6', '1.10.7', '1.10.8', '1.10.9', '1.10.10']] Core Airflow service using CeleryExecutor; contains the vulnerable code path that deserializes broker messages.
- [SOFT-CACHE][redis][['5.0.9']] Message broker used by Airflow CeleryExecutor; required for task queueing and to reproduce the vulnerability scenario.
- [SOFT-CACHE][rabbitmq][['3.8.9']] Alternative message broker for Airflow CeleryExecutor; also needed to provide the queue that can be accessed by an attacker.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.21.6']] Web server that can front the Airflow web UI; required to run a complete Docker‑Compose deployment of Airflow.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: To get the container running you should remove the privileged settings that Docker refuses to apply on many hosts—delete the cap_add: ALL and the security_opt: apparmor=unconfined lines from the compose file, then rebuild and restart the service. While you’re editing the compose file, replace the insecure os.system(f"docker {cmd}") call in app.py with a safe implementation that validates or restricts the input, or simply remove the /exploit endpoint if you only need the demonstration page; this eliminates the command‑injection path that would otherwise cause the container to fail during start‑up. After these changes, run docker‑compose build and docker‑compose up again and the service should start correctly.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack fails is that the Airflow container exits right after the `bash -c` line finishes because the scheduler is launched in the background with `&` instead of being daemonised, so the process tree ends and Docker thinks the service died. Change the `command` for the airflow service to run the scheduler in daemon mode (e.g. `airflow scheduler -D`) and then start the webserver, for example: `command: bash -c "airflow db init && airflow users create … && airflow scheduler -D && airflow webserver"`; this keeps the main process alive and lets the container stay up. If the vulnerable‑app still won’t start, make sure the Dockerfile copies app.py into the image (the `COPY` line is correct) and that the working directory matches the `CMD`; no other changes are required.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow service is being started with LocalExecutor so it never connects to the Redis or RabbitMQ brokers, and because the Celery‑related environment variables are missing the container crashes when it tries to read the default Celery settings. Change the AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR value to CeleryExecutor and add the broker URL (for example AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0) and a result backend (such as AIRFLOW__CELERY__RESULT_BACKEND=db+sqlite:///usr/local/airflow/airflow.db), and update the depends_on list so Airflow waits for both redis and rabbitmq. With those environment variables in place the Airflow container will start correctly and the broker‑connected services will be usable.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the airflow container fails is that the official apache/airflow:1.10.10 image does not include the Celery extras, so the CeleryExecutor cannot start because the required Python packages (celery, redis or kombu) are missing. To fix it, edit the airflow service definition to install the Celery extras at container start – for example, replace the image line with image: apache/airflow:1.10.10‑python3.8 or add a command that runs pip install "apache‑airflow[celery]" before executing the Airflow commands. After the extra packages are present, the airflow service will be able to connect to the Redis broker and start the scheduler and webserver correctly. If you prefer not to modify the image, you can also switch to the SequentialExecutor in the environment variables, which removes the Celery dependency entirely.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow service is failing because it is started with `AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor` yet the compose file also brings up Redis and RabbitMQ, and the CVE demo requires the Celery executor; without a broker URL Airflow cannot initialise the scheduler and exits. Change the executor to `CeleryExecutor`, add the broker‑URL environment variable (for example `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0` or the RabbitMQ equivalent), and adjust the start‑up command so the scheduler runs in the foreground (drop the `-D` flag) before launching the webserver. After updating those three lines the Airflow container will start correctly and the rest of the stack will be reachable.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common reason the stack hangs is that the Airflow service is trying to install the Celery extras at container‑startup – the official apache/airflow:1.10.10 image already contains the right version of Airflow and pulling the extra packages on‑the‑fly often fails (missing system libs, version conflicts, or a blocked internet connection), which stops the container before the scheduler and webserver can launch. To fix it, remove the `pip install 'apache‑airflow[celery]' &&` part from the `command` line, keep only the initialization steps (`airflow db init && airflow users create … && airflow scheduler & && airflow webserver`), and optionally add a persistent volume for `/usr/local/airflow` so the SQLite DB survives restarts. After rebuilding (`docker‑compose up --build`) the Airflow container will start correctly and the other services (Redis, RabbitMQ, nginx, vulnerable‑app) will be reachable.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The problem is caused by the Airflow service being configured to use the CeleryExecutor while the compose file starts **both** a Redis broker and a RabbitMQ broker, yet only the Redis URL is supplied in `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`. When Airflow starts it tries to contact RabbitMQ (because it is listed in `depends_on`) and fails, which brings the whole stack down. The fix is to keep a single broker and align the environment variables with the service that is actually used. Edit the compose file so that the RabbitMQ service is removed (or change the broker URL to point at RabbitMQ), and delete the RabbitMQ entry from the `depends_on` list of the `airflow` service. After that the Airflow container will start correctly, the Redis broker will be reachable, and the rest of the services (nginx and the vulnerable demo app) will run without interruption.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow service is being started with `LocalExecutor` and only the webserver command, while the compose file also pulls in a Redis broker that isn’t used; this mismatch makes the container fail to start properly (the webserver exits because the scheduler isn’t running and the executor can’t find a broker). Change the Airflow environment to use the Celery executor and point it at the Redis service, and start both the scheduler (and optionally a Celery worker) alongside the webserver. For example, replace `AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=LocalExecutor` with `AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTOR=CeleryExecutor` and add `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0` to the environment list, then modify the `command` to launch the scheduler (e.g. `airflow scheduler & airflow webserver`) or add separate `airflow-scheduler` and `airflow-worker` services. This aligns the container configuration with the broker you’ve defined and lets the Airflow service start correctly.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Airflow container is failing because the start‑up command you’re using is for Airflow 2.x, while the image you run is Airflow 1.10.10. In 1.10.10 the database is created with `airflow initdb` (not `airflow db init`), the CLI for creating a user is `airflow create_user` (or `airflow createsuperuser`), and the scheduler and webserver must be launched in the foreground or with a process supervisor. Fix the problem by changing the `command` for the **airflow** service to something like:

```yaml
command: >
  bash -c "
    pip install 'apache-airflow[celery]==1.10.10' &&
    airflow initdb &&
    airflow create_user \
        --username admin \
        --firstname Admin \
        --lastname User \
        --role Admin \
        --email admin@example.com \
        --password admin &&
    airflow scheduler &
    airflow webserver"
```

(If you prefer the older `createsuperuser` syntax, replace the `create_user` line accordingly.) After correcting the command, `docker compose up` will bring the Airflow container up correctly, and the rest of the stack (Redis, RabbitMQ, Nginx, vulnerable‑app) will start without further changes.
