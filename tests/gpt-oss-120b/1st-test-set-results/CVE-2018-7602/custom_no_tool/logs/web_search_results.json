    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u20117602 is a highly critical remote code execution flaw in Drupal core affecting both Drupal 7.x and Drupal 8.x. The vulnerability resides in the request handling and caching subsystems of Drupal, allowing an attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests that inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control of the compromised site, enabling execution of system commands, deployment of malware, or complete takeover of the host. The flaw is identified in security advisory SA\u2011CORE\u20112018\u2011002 and has been actively exploited in the wild. Mitigation requires upgrading Drupal to a patched release (7.59+, 8.4.8+, 8.5.3+).",
