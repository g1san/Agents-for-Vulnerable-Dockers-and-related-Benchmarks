    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201125157 is a critical vulnerability in GeoServer that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL statements through the CQL_FILTER parameter of OGC service endpoints (WFS, WMS, WCS). The GeoServer code concatenates the user\u2011supplied filter directly into SQL statements generated by the GeoTools JDBCDataStore without proper escaping or the use of prepared statements. This enables remote code execution on the underlying relational database, data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service. The flaw affects any GeoServer instance that uses a relational\u2011database\u2011backed data store (PostGIS, Oracle, MySQL, SQL\u2011Server, etc.) and does not have the patched versions installed.",
