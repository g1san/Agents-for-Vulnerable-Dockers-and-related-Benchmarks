    "desc": "CVE\u20112015\u20111427 is a vulnerability in the Groovy scripting engine that is built into Elasticsearch versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.7 and 1.4.0 through 1.4.2. The Groovy sandbox that is supposed to restrict script execution can be bypassed by invoking Java reflection on a whitelisted class (e.g., java.lang.Math) to obtain references to arbitrary Java classes such as java.lang.Runtime. An attacker who can send a crafted Groovy script to the Elasticsearch HTTP API (normally the _search endpoint on port 9200) can therefore escape the sandbox and execute any operating\u2011system command with the privileges of the Elasticsearch process, leading to full remote code execution on the host.",
