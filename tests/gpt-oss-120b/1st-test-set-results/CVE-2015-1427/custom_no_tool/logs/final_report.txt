CVE description: CVE‑2015‑1427 is a vulnerability in the Groovy scripting engine that is built into Elasticsearch versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.7 and 1.4.0 through 1.4.2. The Groovy sandbox that is supposed to restrict script execution can be bypassed by invoking Java reflection on a whitelisted class (e.g., java.lang.Math) to obtain references to arbitrary Java classes such as java.lang.Runtime. An attacker who can send a crafted Groovy script to the Elasticsearch HTTP API (normally the _search endpoint on port 9200) can therefore escape the sandbox and execute any operating‑system command with the privileges of the Elasticsearch process, leading to full remote code execution on the host.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][elasticsearch][['1.3.0', '1.3.1', '1.3.2', '1.3.3', '1.3.4', '1.3.5', '1.3.6', '1.3.7', '1.4.0', '1.4.1', '1.4.2']] Vulnerable Elasticsearch service that exposes the REST API on port 9200; the Groovy scripting engine in these versions permits sandbox bypass leading to remote code execution.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the phpmyadmin tag you’re referencing (phpmyadmin:4.0.10.1) no longer exists in the public registry, causing Docker to abort when it can’t pull the image; switching to a currently‑available tag (for example phpmyadmin:latest or phpmyadmin:5.2) resolves the pull error and lets the stack start. At the same time, the compose file declares version 3.7 but uses a MySQL 5.5 image that expects the legacy `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable—this is fine, but the volume mount for `init.sql` must be expressed with an absolute or correctly‑relative path; changing `./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` to `${PWD}/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` (or moving the compose file into the same directory as init.sql) guarantees the file is found at build time. After updating the phpmyadmin image reference and confirming the init script path resolves correctly, `docker-compose up --build` will run without the previous error.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the MySQL container already creates the testdb database from the MYSQL_DATABASE environment variable, so the CREATE DATABASE testdb; statement in init.sql causes a duplicate‑database error when the entrypoint script runs the initialization file; simply delete that line (leaving only the USE testdb; and the table‑creation/INSERT statements) and the container will start successfully. If the compose file cannot find init.sql, verify that the file sits next to docker‑compose.yml or give a full path (e.g., ./mysql/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql). Finally, make sure the phpMyAdmin image tag exists (e.g., phpmyadmin:5.2.1 or use phpmyadmin:latest); adjusting the tag to a valid one will stop the image‑pull error. After those changes, docker compose up will bring up both services without terminating.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the Elasticsearch 1.4.2 image expects a few extra settings that aren’t provided, so the container can’t start and Docker aborts the build; adding a minimal set of required environment variables (for example `- network.host=0.0.0.0` and `- http.port=9200`) and explicitly declaring the named volume before it’s used solves the problem, and you should also make sure the image reference is correct (use `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:1.4.2` exactly as shown). Updating the file to include those environment entries and keeping the `volumes:` section as‑is will let Docker compose build and run the Elasticsearch service successfully.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is pulling an image that doesn’t exist at docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:1.4.2, so Docker fails when it tries to download it. Change the image line to reference the correct repository (the legacy Elasticsearch images are still hosted on Docker Hub), for example image: elasticsearch:1.4.2, or pull the exact tag you need from the official registry and update the name accordingly. After fixing the image reference, run docker‑compose up again and the stack should start without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The most common reason the compose fails is that the official elasticsearch:1.4.2 image is no longer available on Docker Hub, so Docker can’t pull it when it tries to build the stack. To fix this, replace the image line with a tag that still exists (for example docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:1.4.2 or an older archive image you host yourself), or create a small Dockerfile that starts FROM ubuntu:16.04 and installs Elasticsearch 1.4.2 manually, then reference that Dockerfile in the build section of the compose file. After updating the image reference (or adding a build context) the service will start without the earlier pull‑error.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the image is missing a few required directories and is pulling a Java runtime that isn’t compatible with the old 1.4‑series Elasticsearch binaries. I would change the Dockerfile to install openjdk‑7‑jre (the version Elasticsearch 1.4.x expects), add a `mkdir -p $ES_HOME/logs` line before cleaning up, and make sure the logs directory is owned by the same user that runs Elasticsearch. Finally I would update the `CMD` line to point at the newly created logs path (e.g. `-Des.default.path.logs=/usr/share/elasticsearch/logs`). With those adjustments the image builds and the container starts correctly.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because Ubuntu 16.04 no longer provides the `openjdk-7-jre` package, so the `apt‑get install` step aborts. Replace the JRE installation with a version that exists in the 16.04 repositories—e.g. `openjdk-8-jre` (or `openjdk-8-jdk` if you need the compiler). Adjust the Dockerfile line that installs packages to read `apt‑get install -y wget gnupg openjdk-8-jre` (or the JDK variant). After swapping the JRE package the rest of the Dockerfile works unchanged, and the image will build successfully. If you still need Java 7 specifically, you could add an older Ubuntu repository or use a different base image that still carries that package, but the simplest fix is to move to Java 8, which Elasticsearch 1.4.2 supports.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Elasticsearch container only publishes port 9200 (hostPort 9200) as defined in the docker-compose file and reflected in the docker inspect output. While the image also exposes the default transport port 9300, it is not bound to any host port, so the service is not accessible via its full default network interface. Consequently, not all default ports are exposed, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- ERROR: The Elasticsearch container only publishes port 9200 (hostPort 9200) as defined in the docker-compose file and reflected in the docker inspect output. While the image also exposes the default transport port 9300, it is not bound to any host port, so the service is not accessible via its full default network interface. Consequently, not all default ports are exposed, causing the network_setup milestone to fail.
	- FIX: To resolve the issue, add a mapping for the transport port in the compose file so that the container’s 9300 port is bound to a host port, for example under the ports section include "9300:9300". This simple change publishes the full Elasticsearch network interface, allowing the network_setup milestone to succeed. (No other changes to the Dockerfile are required.)
