    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201114574 is an open\u2011redirect vulnerability in the core Django web\u2011framework. The flaw resides in `django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware` when the setting `APPEND_SLASH=True` (the default). Django automatically appends a trailing slash to URLs that do not match any pattern; if the resulting path forms a double\u2011slash (e.g., `//evil.com`) the middleware builds a redirect response without properly validating the scheme. Browsers interpret the double\u2011slash as an authority\u2011only URL and therefore redirect the user to the attacker\u2011controlled site. This vulnerability can be exploited over the network without authentication by sending a crafted request containing a malicious \u201cnext\u201d or similar parameter. Successful exploitation results in phishing, credential harvesting, or drive\u2011by attacks, but does not affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the vulnerable host beyond the redirection. The issue affects Django 1.11.x versions prior to 1.11.15 and Django 2.0.x versions prior to 2.0.8. The vulnerability was fixed in Django 1.11.15, Django 2.0.8 and later releases, and in subsequent long\u2011term support branches (e.g., Django 2.1.2 and newer).",
