# CVE-2016-3088 Demo Environment

This docker-compose configuration launches a vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ instance (version 5.13.0) that reproduces the remote code execution vulnerability described in CVE‑2016‑3088.

## Services
- **activemq** – Apache ActiveMQ broker exposing the standard OpenWire port (61616) and the admin console (8161).

## Usage
```bash
# From the directory containing the compose file
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```
The broker will be available at `http://localhost:8161` (admin console) and `localhost:61616` for messaging clients.

**Note:** This setup is intentionally vulnerable and should be used only in isolated, secure test environments.
