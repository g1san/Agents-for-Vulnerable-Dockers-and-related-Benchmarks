    "desc": "CVE\u20112016\u20113088 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ versions prior to 5.14.0. The flaw resides in the built\u2011in Fileserver servlet of the Jetty web server that ActiveMQ ships with. The Fileserver accepts file uploads via HTTP PUT and allows moving those files via HTTP MOVE without proper authentication or path validation. An unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious JSP, servlet, or other executable payload and then move it into a directory that is served and executed by the broker (for example, the admin web application). This results in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the ActiveMQ process.",
