----------------------------------------


CVE description: CVE‑2016‑3088 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ versions prior to 5.14.0. The flaw resides in the built‑in Fileserver servlet of the Jetty web server that ActiveMQ ships with. The Fileserver accepts file uploads via HTTP PUT and allows moving those files via HTTP MOVE without proper authentication or path validation. An unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious JSP, servlet, or other executable payload and then move it into a directory that is served and executed by the broker (for example, the admin web application). This results in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the ActiveMQ process.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][apache/activemq][['5.0.0', '5.0.1', '5.0.2', '5.1.0', '5.1.1', '5.2.0', '5.3.0', '5.4.0', '5.5.0', '5.5.1', '5.6.0', '5.7.0', '5.8.0', '5.9.0', '5.10.0', '5.11.0', '5.12.0', '5.13.0']] Apache ActiveMQ provides the vulnerable Fileserver servlet on its built‑in Jetty HTTP interface (default port 8161). Running any of the listed versions reproduces the remote code execution flaw.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine‑based Python image can’t compile the Docker SDK’s binary dependencies; switching to a non‑Alpine base (for example `FROM python:3.7‑slim`) or installing the required build tools (e.g. `apk add --no‑cache gcc musl-dev python3-dev libffi-dev openssl-dev`) before the `pip install` line resolves the issue, and once the SDK installs correctly the Flask container will start without errors. Additionally, make sure the Docker volume is correctly bound (e.g. `- /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker`) so the daemon service can persist its data.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile removes the library packages that the docker‑py client needs at runtime – you purge libffi-dev and libssl-dev after installing the Python wheels, which leaves the compiled extensions without their shared libraries. To fix it, keep the runtime libraries in the final image (either by omitting them from the apt‑get purge or by installing the corresponding non‑dev packages such as libffi7 and libssl1.1) and only purge the compiler tools, then rebuild the image. Additionally, change the default Docker host in app.py to point at the Docker daemon service (e.g., tcp://docker‑daemon:2375) so the container can reach the daemon when the DOCKER_HOST environment variable isn’t set. After these adjustments the image should build and run without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the image discards the libraries that the Docker SDK (and its transitive dependencies such as cryptography) need at runtime – the `libffi-dev` and `libssl-dev` packages are removed after the `pip install`, leaving only the header files gone but also wiping out the actual shared libraries required when the container later imports the SDK. To fix it, keep the runtime libraries while still cleaning up the compiler, for example by installing the build‑time packages (`gcc libffi-dev python3-dev libssl-dev`), running `pip install`, then purging only the compiler (`gcc`) and the *‑dev* packages, but reinstall the runtime equivalents (`libffi6`/`libffi8` and `libssl1.1`/`libssl3`) before the final clean‑up. In practice you can modify the Dockerfile to add a step after the `pip install` that runs `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libffi6 libssl1.1 && apt-get purge -y gcc libffi-dev python3-dev libssl-dev && apt-get autoremove -y && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. This preserves the necessary shared libraries, allowing the image to build and the Flask app to start without errors.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the runtime libraries you try to install (`libssl1.1` and `libffi7`) are not available in the base image’s package repository, and the subsequent purge removes the development packages that the Docker SDK needs to keep its compiled extensions working. To fix it, change the base image to a newer slim variant (for example `python:3.7‑slim‑buster` or `python:3.7‑slim‑bullseye`) where `libssl1.1` and `libffi7` exist, install the runtime libs *before* purging the build‑time ones, and either keep the development packages or drop the purge entirely so the SDK can load its native modules. A minimal change is to replace the `FROM` line with a newer tag, move the `apt‑get install libssl1.1 libffi7` line up before the `apt‑get purge …` line, and remove the purge of `libssl-dev` and `libffi-dev` (or delete the purge step altogether). After these adjustments the image should build without error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the build‑time packages aren’t available on the python:3.7‑slim‑bullseye base – the Debian “bullseye” repository needs the apt‑transport‑https package and the libssl‑dev header is now called libssl1.1‑dev. To fix it, replace the base line with a currently‑supported tag (e.g. python:3.9‑slim) or add the missing transport package and use the correct SSL dev package name, then install the build tools, run pip install and finally purge only the compilers. After that the Dockerfile will build cleanly.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the image removes the compiler and Python headers before the Docker SDK and its dependencies (which need to compile native extensions) are fully installed; move the apt‑get purge to the end of the Dockerfile line after the pip install has succeeded, or simply omit the purge altogether, and make sure the pip install command is the last step before cleaning the apt cache. In practice you can replace the current RUN statement with one that updates/install‑build‑deps, runs pip install --no‑cache‑dir flask docker, and only then runs apt‑get purge gcc python3‑dev && apt‑get autoremove && apt‑get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*; this ensures all required compilation tools are present when the Python packages are built and eliminates the “failed to build wheel” error.

# CVE-2016-3088 Demo Environment

This docker-compose configuration launches a vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ instance (version 5.13.0) that reproduces the remote code execution vulnerability described in CVE‑2016‑3088.

## Services
- **activemq** – Apache ActiveMQ broker exposing the standard OpenWire port (61616) and the admin console (8161).

## Usage
```bash
# From the directory containing the compose file
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```
The broker will be available at `http://localhost:8161` (admin console) and `localhost:61616` for messaging clients.

**Note:** This setup is intentionally vulnerable and should be used only in isolated, secure test environments.
