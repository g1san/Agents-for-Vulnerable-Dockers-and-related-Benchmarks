    "desc": "CVE\u20112024\u20117314 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the anji\u2011plus AJ\u2011Report web\u2011reporting service. The flaw resides in the URL handling logic of AJ\u2011Report; by appending the string `;swagger\u2011ui` to any request path (for example `http://target/aj-report;swagger-ui`), the server skips its normal authentication checks and serves the embedded Swagger UI without requiring credentials. The Swagger UI exposes privileged AJ\u2011Report operations that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server, leading to full remote code execution and complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All versions of AJ\u2011Report prior to 1.4.1 are affected. No official patch is available for the vulnerable versions, and mitigation typically involves blocking the Swagger UI endpoint or upgrading to version 1.4.1 or later.",
