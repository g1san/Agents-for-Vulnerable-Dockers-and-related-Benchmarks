CVE description: CVE‑2024‑7314 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the anji‑plus AJ‑Report web‑reporting service. The flaw resides in the URL handling logic of AJ‑Report; by appending the string `;swagger‑ui` to any request path (for example `http://target/aj-report;swagger-ui`), the server skips its normal authentication checks and serves the embedded Swagger UI without requiring credentials. The Swagger UI exposes privileged AJ‑Report operations that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server, leading to full remote code execution and complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All versions of AJ‑Report prior to 1.4.1 are affected. No official patch is available for the vulnerable versions, and mitigation typically involves blocking the Swagger UI endpoint or upgrading to version 1.4.1 or later.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][anji-plus/aj-report][['1.0.0', '1.0.1', '1.0.2', '1.1.0', '1.1.1', '1.2.0', '1.2.1', '1.3.0', '1.3.1', '1.4.0']] Core AJ‑Report application that contains the vulnerable URL handling logic. Deploying a vulnerable version makes the Docker environment susceptible to CVE‑2024‑7314.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.27.0']] Provides a reverse‑proxy web server to expose the AJ‑Report service over HTTP. Required for the Docker stack to be reachable from the network.
- [SOFT][openjdk][['21-jdk-bullseye']] Java runtime environment needed by the AJ‑Report application to execute.

This is the first version of the generated code:

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition defines a Node.js web service (based on node:14) and a PostgreSQL database (postgres:13). It does not include any of the required services ['anji-plus/aj-report', 'nginx', 'openjdk'], so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, the 'anji-plus/aj-report' service is not used at all, meaning no vulnerable version from the listed set is present; therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- ERROR: The Docker composition defines a Node.js web service (based on node:14) and a PostgreSQL database (postgres:13). It does not include any of the required services ['anji-plus/aj-report', 'nginx', 'openjdk'], so the 'services_ok' milestone fails. Additionally, the 'anji-plus/aj-report' service is not used at all, meaning no vulnerable version from the listed set is present; therefore the 'code_hard_version' milestone also fails.
	- FIX: To satisfy the required milestones you need to replace the placeholder “vulnapp” stack with the actual AJ‑Report components and its supporting services. First, add a service definition for anji-plus/aj-report (using an image that includes version 1.4.0 or earlier) and a matching nginx reverse‑proxy that forwards traffic to the AJ‑Report HTTP port, and also include an openjdk container that the AJ‑Report image can use for its Java runtime. Update the docker‑compose.yml so the web service is removed (or renamed) and the new three services are listed under services, each with the appropriate environment variables and network configuration. By pulling the vulnerable AJ‑Report image and wiring it to nginx and openjdk, the composition now contains a hard‑coded vulnerable version and the required service types, allowing the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones to pass.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the ajreport container is declared to depend on an openjdk service that never actually provides anything to ajreport – the AJ‑Report image already contains its own JDK and the openjdk service only runs a harmless “tail” command, which can cause the dependency graph to stall during startup. To fix the problem, remove the openjdk service (or at least remove the depends_on entry that points to it) and let ajreport run directly from its own image; after that the nginx proxy will be able to start normally and the stack will compose without errors.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the nginx container can’t mount the configuration file – the relative path `./nginx/nginx.conf` must point to a real file that exists next to the docker‑compose.yml, otherwise Docker aborts with a “bind mount source does not exist” error; creating the missing nginx.conf or correcting the path (for example using an absolute path or moving the file into the same directory as the compose file) resolves the mount problem. Additionally, the AJ‑Report service is still using the vulnerable 1.4.0 image, so swapping the image tag to a patched version (e.g. `anji-plus/aj-report:1.4.1` or newer) eliminates the CVE‑2024‑7314 issue and prevents the container from failing any health‑check that might reject the vulnerable version. After fixing the mount and updating the image tag, `docker compose up` should start both services without terminating.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file is trying to mount a file that the engine can’t locate, so the service fails before it even starts; make sure the path to the nginx configuration is correct relative to the compose file (for example, move the nginx.conf into a ./nginx directory that sits next to docker‑compose.yml or change the mount line to the absolute path of the file) and rename the file to the name nginx expects (e.g. default.conf or update the mount target accordingly). After correcting the bind‑mount source path and ensuring the file exists inside the container directory (or using a type: bind declaration if you’re on a newer Compose version), docker‑compose will bring up both containers without the build‑time error.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker composition does not use the 'anji-plus/aj-report' image; instead it builds a custom 'ajreport' service from source based on openjdk:21. Therefore the required service 'anji-plus/aj-report' is missing, and consequently no version from the allowed list (1.0.0‑1.4.0) is used. While nginx and openjdk are present, the absence of the specific aj-report service causes both the 'services_ok' and 'code_hard_version' milestones to fail.

While nginx and openjdk are present, the absence of the specific aj-report service causes both the 'services_ok' and 'code_hard_version' milestones to fail.
	- FIX: To fix the failure you need to replace the custom‑built ajreport service with the official anji-plus/aj-report image at an allowed version (for example anji-plus/aj-report:1.4.0). In docker‑compose.yml change the ajreport service to use image: anji-plus/aj-report:1.4.0 instead of the build: section (or update the Dockerfile to FROM that image), and remove the custom Java source files since they are no longer needed. This ensures the stack runs a supported AJ‑Report version and satisfies the services_ok and code_hard_version milestones.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose fails because it tries to pull the non‑existent tag 1.4.0 of the anji‑plus/aj‑report image; the repository only provides tags up to 1.4.0‑snapshot or the newer patched 1.4.1, so Docker cannot find a matching image. Change the ajreport service to use a valid tag (for example anji-plus/aj-report:1.4.1) or build the image locally by adding a build: section that points at a Dockerfile for the vulnerable version. At the same time, remove the optional container_name fields (they can clash with existing stopped containers) and ensure the nginx volume mount points to the correct relative path (e.g., ./nginx/nginx.conf) so the file is found when the stack starts. After these adjustments the compose file will bring the stack up without build‑time errors.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is caused by the unnecessary openjdk service – the aj-report image already contains its own Java runtime, so Docker tries to start a second container that never gets used and the “depends_on” relationship confuses the startup order. Remove the openjdk service definition from the compose file and also drop the depends_on entry under ajreport (the AJ‑Report container can start directly). After deleting those two lines the stack will pull the three official images (aj‑report, nginx and the existing openjdk base) and launch without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The compose file fails because the Nginx container cannot find the configuration file at the path you mounted; the relative path `./nginx/nginx.conf` is resolved from the location where Docker Compose is executed, not from the compose file’s directory, so the volume mount ends up pointing at a non‑existent file and the container aborts. Move the `nginx` folder next to the compose file (or run Docker Compose from that directory) and change the volume line to use an absolute or correctly‑relative path, for example `- ${PWD}/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro`. Adding a `depends_on: - ajreport` under the Nginx service ensures the AJ‑Report container is started first, eliminating any race condition when Nginx tries to resolve the `ajreport` host. After correcting the mount path and adding the dependency, the stack builds and runs without error.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup does not include the 'anji-plus/aj-report' service at any version; the 'ajreport' image is built from a custom Dockerfile based on openjdk:21 and busybox, not from anji-plus/aj-report, so it cannot match any of the listed vulnerable versions. Consequently, the 'code_hard_version' milestone is not met. Additionally, while the composition uses 'nginx' and 'openjdk', it lacks the required 'anji-plus/aj-report' service, causing the 'services_ok' milestone to fail.

	- FIX: To satisfy the milestones you need to replace the placeholder “ajreport” image with the real anji-plus/aj‑report image at a vulnerable version (for example anji-plus/aj-report:1.4.0) or build the proper AJ‑Report binary inside the Dockerfile instead of installing busybox. In docker‑compose.yml change the ajreport service to use image: anji-plus/aj-report:1.4.0 (and remove the custom build section), keep the port exposure on 8080, and keep the nginx proxy as is. This restores the required hard‑service dependency and meets the services_ok milestone.
