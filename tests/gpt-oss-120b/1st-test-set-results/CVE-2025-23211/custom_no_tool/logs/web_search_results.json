    "desc": "CVE\u20112025\u201123211 is a Server\u2011Side Template Injection vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes web application (Python/Django). The Jinja2 template helper concatenates user\u2011supplied markdown instructions directly into a Jinja2 template without sanitisation. An attacker can insert a malicious Jinja2 payload that reaches the template engine, causing Python's subprocess module to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands. In the default Docker\u2011Compose deployment the container runs as root, so the executed commands obtain full system privileges, allowing complete host compromise, data theft, and potential Docker escape. The flaw affects all releases up to and including version 1.5.23 and is fixed in version 1.5.24.",
