CVE description: CVE‑2025‑23211 is a Server‑Side Template Injection vulnerability in the Tandoor Recipes web application (Python/Django). The Jinja2 template helper concatenates user‑supplied markdown instructions directly into a Jinja2 template without sanitisation. An attacker can insert a malicious Jinja2 payload that reaches the template engine, causing Python's subprocess module to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands. In the default Docker‑Compose deployment the container runs as root, so the executed commands obtain full system privileges, allowing complete host compromise, data theft, and potential Docker escape. The flaw affects all releases up to and including version 1.5.23 and is fixed in version 1.5.24.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container fails because the Flask process tries to open a connection to the PostgreSQL service at import time, before the database is ready, which raises an exception and stops the app from starting. Move the `psycopg2.connect` call inside a function (for example, in a request‑scoped helper) and wrap it in a try/except block that retries until the health‑check reports the DB as up, or at least returns a clear error instead of crashing the whole service. While you’re editing the code, replace the unsafe `os.popen` call with a safe subprocess invocation that passes the search term as a separate argument (or, better yet, read the file in Python and filter it) to eliminate the command‑injection flaw and ensure the container runs without being aborted by a runtime error. Finally, rebuild the image and restart the compose stack so that the app can successfully connect to the database after it becomes healthy.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file only defines two services: vulnerable-app (a Python Flask app) and db (postgres:13-alpine). No service based on the tandoorrecipes/recipes image is present, so the required tandoorrecipes/recipes version cannot be checked, causing the 'code_hard_version' milestone to fail. Additionally, the required list of services includes both tandoorrecipes/recipes and postgres, but only postgres is used; the absence of the tandoorrecipes/recipes service makes the 'services_ok' milestone fail.
	- ERROR: The compose file only defines two services: vulnerable-app (a Python Flask app) and db (postgres:13-alpine).

Additionally, the required list of services includes both tandoorrecipes/recipes and postgres, but only postgres is used; the absence of the tandoorrecipes/recipes service makes the 'services_ok' milestone fail.
	- FIX: Add a tandoorrecipes/recipes service to the compose file, using the hardened image (for example tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.24 or newer) and expose the port it needs, then update vulnerable‑app to depend on that service instead of—or in addition to—the database. Make sure the new service is listed in the services_ok milestone by giving it the correct name and version tag, and keep the existing postgres service unchanged so the database dependency remains satisfied. This brings the required hard‑coded service into the stack and allows the version check to succeed.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the python:3‑11‑slim image does not contain the native libraries and build tools required to compile psycopg2‑binary, so the pip install step aborts. To fix it, edit the Dockerfile to install the PostgreSQL client headers and a compiler before running pip and then clean them up afterwards; for example, add a line such as RUN apt‑get update && apt‑get install -y gcc libpq-dev && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* before the pip install command, and optionally remove the build tools after the installation to keep the image lightweight. With the necessary packages present, the image will build successfully and the rest of the compose stack can start.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The image fails because the runtime libraries needed by the PostgreSQL client driver are removed during the “light‑weight” cleanup. You install `gcc` and `libpq-dev` only to compile the wheel, then you purge **both** of them, which also strips out the shared library (`libpq.so`) that `psycopg2‑binary` needs when the container starts, causing the build (or the first import of psycopg2) to abort.  

Fix it by keeping the runtime package (`libpq5`) and only removing the build‑time tools. After installing the build dependencies, run the pip install, then purge just `gcc` (and any other compilers) while leaving `libpq5` installed, and clean the apt cache. In practice you can change the Dockerfile to:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Install build‑time tools plus the runtime libpq library
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc libpq-dev libpq5 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Remove only the compiler and header files; keep libpq5 for psycopg2
RUN apt-get purge -y --auto-remove gcc libpq-dev && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /root/.cache/pip

COPY app.py .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

With `libpq5` retained, the container can start, the Flask app can import `psycopg2`, and the Docker build will complete without errors.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile installs the compiler and the libpq development package only to compile psycopg2‑binary, which is already pre‑built and does not need any build‑time tools; when those packages are later purged the runtime libpq5 library is sometimes removed as an automatic dependency, leaving the image without the PostgreSQL client library required by psycopg2. To fix it, simplify the Dockerfile by installing only the runtime libpq5 package (or omit it entirely if you rely on the binary wheel) and eliminate the gcc and libpq-dev steps, removing the purge section as well; this guarantees that the required libraries remain in the final image and the build completes successfully. Additionally, ensure that the `apt-get clean` and removal of the package lists happen after the `pip install` step so the layer that installs dependencies is not disrupted.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The tandoorrecipes service is using image tag tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.24, which is not included in the allowed versions list (allowed up to 1.5.23). Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services tandoorrecipes/recipes and postgres are present, so services_ok is true.
	- ERROR: The tandoorrecipes service is using image tag tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.24, which is not included in the allowed versions list (allowed up to 1.5.23). Therefore the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The required services tandoorrecipes/recipes and postgres are present, so services_ok is true.
	- FIX: To satisfy the hard‑version requirement, change the tandoorrecipes service to use an allowed image tag (for example tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.23) instead of 1.5.24, or rebuild the placeholder Dockerfile to base it on the approved 1.5.23 image. Updating the image field in docker‑compose.yml to the permitted version will bring the code_hard_version milestone into compliance while keeping the rest of the stack unchanged.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the vulnerable‑app image is trying to install the binary psycopg2‑binary on top of the very slim python:3.11‑slim base without the native libraries it needs; the thin Debian image only has the runtime libpq client (`libpq5`) but the wheel still expects the header files and a C compiler to be present, causing apt‑get to abort and the Docker build to stop. To fix it, edit the vulnerable‑app/Dockerfile so that it installs the development packages (e.g. `libpq-dev` and `gcc` or the full `build-essential` meta‑package) before running `pip install`, and then clean up the extra tools after the install to keep the image small. A minimal change looks like adding a line such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libpq5 libpq-dev gcc && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` just before the `pip install` step; this provides the needed headers and compiler, lets the wheel compile, and the subsequent cleanup restores the intended lightweight footprint. Once those packages are present the Docker build proceeds without error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The compose file uses a custom image 'custom_no_tool-tandoorrecipes' built from Alpine, not the official 'tandoorrecipes/recipes' image, so the required service is not present and no version from the allowed list (1.5.0‑1.5.23) is used. Although the 'postgres' service (postgres:13-alpine) is present, the missing/incorrect tandoorrecipes service causes both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The compose file uses a custom image 'custom_no_tool-tandoorrecipes' built from Alpine, not the official 'tandoorrecipes/recipes' image, so the required service is not present and no version from the allowed list (1.5.0‑1.5.23) is used. Although the 'postgres' service (postgres:13-alpine) is present, the missing/incorrect tandoorrecipes service causes both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: Replace the placeholder tandoorrecipes service with a real image from the vulnerable list—e.g. set image: tandoorrecipes/recipes:1.5.23 instead of building an Alpine stub, and remove the custom Dockerfile for that service. Keep the service name tandoorrecipes so the compose file still references it, and optionally add a restart: unless-stopped policy matching the original definition. After swapping to the correct vulnerable image, the compose file will contain both required services (the PostgreSQL database and the vulnerable Tandoor Recipes container) and the milestones will succeed.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the slim Python base image doesn’t include everything required to compile the psycopg2‑binary wheel – you need the full compiler tool‑chain (e.g., build‑essential) and the PostgreSQL development headers before running pip and you have to keep the runtime library libpq5 until the image is finalized. Fix it by extending the first apt‑get install line to include build‑essential (and optionally python3-dev) so the wheel can be built, then purge only the build‑time packages (gcc, libpq-dev, build‑essential, python3-dev) after pip completes, leaving libpq5 installed for runtime. This small change ensures the image builds successfully without affecting the app’s functionality.
