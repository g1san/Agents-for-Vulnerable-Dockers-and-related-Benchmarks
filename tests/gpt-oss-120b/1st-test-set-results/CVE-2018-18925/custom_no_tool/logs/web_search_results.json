    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201118925 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the self\u2011hosted Git service Gogs. The flaw resides in the file\u2011based session provider of the Macaron web framework used by Gogs. The session identifier supplied by the client is concatenated directly to the path of the session directory without validation, allowing directory\u2011traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\") in the cookie value. An attacker can craft a session cookie that points to an arbitrary file, such as an uploaded file containing a malicious Go gob\u2011encoded session structure. When Gogs loads this file as a session, the attacker is authenticated as any user, typically the administrator (UID\u202f1). Once logged in as an admin, the attacker can create or modify Git hook scripts (pre\u2011receive, post\u2011receive, etc.) through the web interface. These hooks are executed by the Git server on repository operations, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary operating\u2011system commands on the host. The combination of unauthenticated session hijacking and insecure Git\u2011hook handling results in full remote code execution and complete system compromise.",
