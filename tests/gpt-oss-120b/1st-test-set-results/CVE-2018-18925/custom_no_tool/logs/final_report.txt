CVE description: CVE‑2018‑18925 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the self‑hosted Git service Gogs. The flaw resides in the file‑based session provider of the Macaron web framework used by Gogs. The session identifier supplied by the client is concatenated directly to the path of the session directory without validation, allowing directory‑traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in the cookie value. An attacker can craft a session cookie that points to an arbitrary file, such as an uploaded file containing a malicious Go gob‑encoded session structure. When Gogs loads this file as a session, the attacker is authenticated as any user, typically the administrator (UID 1). Once logged in as an admin, the attacker can create or modify Git hook scripts (pre‑receive, post‑receive, etc.) through the web interface. These hooks are executed by the Git server on repository operations, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary operating‑system commands on the host. The combination of unauthenticated session hijacking and insecure Git‑hook handling results in full remote code execution and complete system compromise.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container likely isn’t staying up because the compose file tries to start the app with `flask run` (which depends on the FLASK_APP environment variable and the Flask CLI being on the PATH) while the image only installs the Python packages; a more reliable approach is to launch the script directly with Python. Change the `command` in docker‑compose.yml to `python vulnerable_app.py`, remove the FLASK_APP environment entry (it’s no longer needed), and optionally add a `CMD ["python","vulnerable_app.py"]` to the Dockerfile as a fallback. After rebuilding the image and restarting the service, the Flask process will start correctly and the container will stay running.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is probably crashing because the Flask server is started with the default development reloader, which expects an interactive terminal and exits when it detects it is not attached; you can fix this by disabling the reloader and forcing the script to run in non‑debug mode, for example by changing the last line of vulnerable_app.py to `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=False, use_reloader=False)` and updating the Dockerfile CMD to `["python","-u","vulnerable_app.py"]` so the process stays attached to the container’s stdout. While you’re editing the code, also replace the insecure subprocess.check_output call with a safer subprocess.run that validates the command (e.g., only allow a whitelist of permitted binaries or split the command into an argument list) to prevent the CVE‑2018‑18925 exploit from being triggered. After rebuilding the image and redeploying, the service should start correctly and be more secure.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is probably exiting because the `docker‑compose.yml` overrides the image’s default CMD with a command that runs before the Flask app is ready, or because the work‑directory isn’t set when the overridden command is executed. Fix it by removing the explicit `command:` line from the compose file (letting the image’s CMD start the Flask server) and, if you still need to override the entry‑point, add `working_dir: /app` so the script is run from the correct location. After rebuilding the image (`docker compose build`) and restarting the stack (`docker compose up -d`), the Flask service should stay up and listen on port 5000.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The provided Docker configuration defines only a single service named 'vulnerable_app' built from the local Dockerfile. There is no reference to the 'gogs/gogs' image in the docker-compose.yml, nor any version tag for it in the image metadata. Consequently, the image does not use any of the listed gogs versions, and the required service 'gogs/gogs' is missing, causing both milestones to fail.
	- ERROR: The provided Docker configuration defines only a single service named 'vulnerable_app' built from the local Dockerfile. There is no reference to the 'gogs/gogs' image in the docker-compose.yml, nor any version tag for it in the image metadata. Consequently, the image does not use any of the listed gogs versions, and the required service 'gogs/gogs' is missing, causing both milestones to fail.
	- FIX: To resolve the missing Gogs service you should replace the current vulnerable_app definition with a service that pulls the official Gogs image at one of the vulnerable versions, for example adding image: gogs/gogs:0.11.0 and exposing the Gogs web port (typically 3000:3000) instead of the Flask‑based placeholders; you can then remove the unused build section and the Python requirements.txt since they are no longer needed, ensuring the compose file now contains a correctly version‑tagged gogs/gogs service that satisfies the CVE‑2018‑18925 environment.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the compose file pulls the pre‑built gogs/gogs:0.11.0 image but the directory also contains a requirements.txt that is never used – Docker tries to run a default‑generated Dockerfile (or an implicit one) that attempts to install those Python packages on the minimal Go‑based Gogs image, where the needed interpreter and compatible libraries are missing (for example, markupsafe 2.0.1 requires a newer Jinja2 and a recent Python version). To fix it, either delete requirements.txt (and any leftover Dockerfile that references it) if you don’t need the Python environment, or create an explicit Dockerfile that starts FROM gogs/gogs:0.11.0, installs a proper Python runtime (e.g., apk add python3 py3-pip or apt‑get install python3‑pip), and then runs pip install -r requirements.txt with dependency versions that match the interpreter (e.g., downgrade markupsafe to 1.1.1 or upgrade Flask/Jinja2 accordingly). After adding the custom Dockerfile, update the compose service to use build: . instead of just image:, and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile assumes the source tree can be compiled straight away with a simple `go build -mod=vendor -o /app/gogs .`, but the freshly‑cloned Gogs repository needs its vendored dependencies staged first (and the target directory for the binary does not exist yet). Fix it by adding a step that creates the /app directory, runs `go mod vendor` (or `go mod tidy` then `go mod vendor`) inside the source tree, and then builds the binary into that directory. In practice the change looks like: after cloning, add `RUN mkdir -p /app && go mod vendor && go build -mod=vendor -o /app/gogs .`. This ensures the vendor folder is populated and the output path exists, allowing the image to build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine image you start from does not have a proper Go workspace initialized, so the `go mod tidy` and `go build` steps cannot locate the module files that Gogs expects. Fix it by switching the base to the official Go Alpine image (e.g., `FROM golang:1.20-alpine3.16`) which already sets up `$GOPATH` and includes the Go toolchain, then remove the separate `apk add go` line, keep the other build‑dependencies (git, ca‑certificates, build‑base, bash), and after cloning the source simply run `go build -mod=vendor -o /app/gogs .`. Finally, keep the `USER 1000:1000` and the `VOLUME /data` sections unchanged. This change gives the build a fully configured Go environment and eliminates the compilation error.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Dockerfile tries to compile Gogs directly from source without pulling in the required build tools and without setting the module mode correctly for the old Go version that Gogs v0.11.x expects. To fix it, change the Dockerfile so it installs the full set of Alpine build utilities (make, gcc, musl‑dev, git, and curl), enable Go modules, and run the official Gogs build script instead of invoking `go build` on the repository root. After checking out the tag, run `make build` (or `./build.sh`) which takes care of vendoring, asset compilation, and binary placement. Finally, copy the resulting binary into `/app/gogs` and keep the rest of the image unchanged. This adjustment resolves the compile‑time errors and lets the image build successfully.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build failure is likely caused by a mismatch between the compose file and the Dockerfile: the compose service declares an external image instead of a build context, yet a Dockerfile exists in the same directory, so Docker tries to build a second image that isn’t referenced and may be missing the required files or context. To resolve this, either delete the unused Dockerfile and rely entirely on the official image specified in the compose file, or change the service definition to use a build key (for example, replace image: gogs/gogs:0.11.0 with build: .) so that Docker knows to build the Dockerfile you provided. After making the file consistent, rerun docker‑compose up and the image should build without errors.
