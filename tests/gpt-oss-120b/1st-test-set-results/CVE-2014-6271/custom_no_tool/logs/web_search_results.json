    "desc": "CVE\u20112014\u20116271, known as Shellshock, is a critical vulnerability in the GNU Bash interpreter. Bash versions up to and including 4.3 mishandle specially crafted function definitions that are exported in environment variables. When Bash parses such a variable it fails to stop parsing at the closing \u201c}\u201d, so any characters that follow are interpreted as ordinary shell commands. An attacker who can influence an environment variable that a vulnerable Bash instance later expands can therefore inject and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the process that invoked Bash. The bug can be triggered by any network\u2011facing service that launches Bash and passes user\u2011controlled data via the environment \u2013 common examples are CGI scripts served by a web server, OpenSSH forced commands, DHCP client scripts, and mail forwarding utilities. Successful exploitation yields arbitrary command execution, which may lead to full system compromise, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or the installation of persistent back\u2011doors.",
