    "desc": "CVE\u20112018\u201119475 is a vulnerability in the Artifex Ghostscript rendering engine (the PostScript/PDF interpreter). The flaw resides in the `psi/zdevice2.c` code path that handles device reuse. When a device is reused the code fails to verify that enough operand\u2011stack space is available. An attacker can provide a specially crafted PostScript or PDF file that triggers a stack overflow during a `restore` operation, causing the internal `LockSafetyParams` flag to remain cleared. This bypasses the `-dSAFER` sandbox and enables the use of the `%pipe%` operator (or setting `/OutputFile` to a pipe) to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the Ghostscript process. The vulnerability affects all Ghostscript releases prior to version\u202f9.26. Exploits allow remote code execution on any system that processes untrusted documents with a vulnerable Ghostscript binary (e.g., print servers, image\u2011conversion services, web applications that embed Ghostscript).",
