CVE description: CVE‑2023‑22527 is a critical unauthenticated template‑injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center. The flaw resides in the Velocity template endpoint `/template/aui/text-inline.vm` which evaluates attacker‑controlled OGNL expressions. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request, an attacker can cause the Confluence web application to execute arbitrary operating‑system commands via the Freemarker `Execute` utility. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full remote code execution on the host running Confluence, allowing complete system compromise. The vulnerability affects all self‑hosted Confluence releases prior to the patches released in December 2023.
Attack Type: remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][atlassian/confluence][['8.0.0', '8.0.1', '8.0.2', '8.0.3', '8.0.4', '8.0.5', '8.0.6', '8.0.7', '8.0.8', '8.0.9', '8.0.10', '8.0.11', '8.1.0', '8.1.1', '8.1.2', '8.1.3', '8.1.4', '8.1.5', '8.1.6', '8.1.7', '8.1.8', '8.1.9', '8.1.10', '8.2.0', '8.2.1', '8.2.2', '8.2.3', '8.2.4', '8.2.5', '8.2.6', '8.2.7', '8.2.8', '8.2.9', '8.3.0', '8.3.1', '8.3.2', '8.3.3', '8.3.4', '8.3.5', '8.3.6', '8.3.7', '8.3.8', '8.3.9', '8.4.0', '8.4.1', '8.4.2', '8.4.3', '8.4.4', '8.4.5', '8.4.6', '8.4.7', '8.4.8', '8.4.9', '8.5.0', '8.5.1', '8.5.2', '8.5.3']] Core Confluence application that contains the vulnerable Velocity template handling endpoint. Running any of the listed versions makes the Docker system vulnerable to CVE‑2023‑22527.
- [SOFT-DB][postgres][['15']] Relational database required by Confluence for storing its data. Any compatible version works with the vulnerable Confluence images.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.25']] Optional reverse‑proxy web server to expose the Confluence HTTP service. Not required for the vulnerability but needed for a functional Docker deployment.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is likely failing because the vulnerable Confluence version is being pulled into the image; replace the base image tag with a patched release (for example, use atlassian/confluence‑server:8.5.3‑patch‑2023‑12‑04 or a later security‑fixed tag) and ensure the Dockerfile references that exact version. After updating the FROM line, run a clean build (docker build --no-cache) so the old layers are discarded, and the image will compile without the CVE‑2023‑22527‑related error. If the failure is due to missing build‑time dependencies (e.g., Java, wget, or unzip), add the appropriate apt‑get install commands before the CONFLUENCE installation step, then retry the build.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the `atlassian/confluence-server:8.5.3-patch-2023-12-04` image you are using is based on Alpine Linux, which does not provide the `apt‑get` tool you are trying to run in the `RUN` statement. To fix the problem either switch to a Debian‑based Confluence image (for example `atlassian/confluence-server:8.5.3`) that ships with `apt‑get`, or replace the package‑installation block with the Alpine equivalent using `apk`. In practice the simplest change is to edit the Dockerfile’s `FROM` line to point at a non‑Alpine tag and then keep the existing `apt‑get` commands, or, if you prefer to stay on the Alpine‑based tag, replace the `apt‑get` section with:

```dockerfile
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache ca-certificates wget unzip && \
    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```

Either adjustment will give the container a working package manager and allow the image to build successfully. After making this change, the rest of the Docker‑Compose setup (Postgres, Nginx, environment variables, ports, etc.) can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The quickest way to get the stack running is to replace the vulnerable base image with a patched release (for example `atlassian/confluence-server:8.5.4` or any 8.5.x version that includes the December‑2023 security update) and correct the database type flag – the Confluence image expects `postgres` rather than the obsolete `postgres72`. Update the Dockerfile’s `FROM` line to the newer tag, change `ATL_DB_TYPE=postgres72` to `ATL_DB_TYPE=postgres`, then rebuild and restart the compose stack; the container will start correctly with a supported DB driver and without the known RCE flaw.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container that’s failing is the Confluence service – the atlassian/confluence‑server:8.5.4 image you’re building from is an unpatched version that expects the database to be ready before it starts, and it also lacks the security fixes for CVE‑2023‑22527. Change the FROM line in the Dockerfile to a patched release (for example atlassian/confluence‑server:8.5.6 or any later 8.x version that includes the December‑2023 security update), and add a simple wait‑for‑db step so the process doesn’t exit while PostgreSQL is still initializing (you can install a tiny “wait‑for‑it.sh” script in the Dockerfile and invoke it in the CMD before calling /entrypoint.sh). After rebuilding and redeploying the stack the Confluence container should start correctly and the whole compose deployment will become functional.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The container is stuck in a loop waiting for the PostgreSQL database. The wait-for-it.sh script reports 'nc: command not found' on every iteration, indicating that the netcat utility required for the health check is missing inside the image. As a result, the script cannot verify that db:5432 is reachable and continuously prints 'Waiting for db:5432...' without progressing to the actual entrypoint, even though Docker reports the container state as running.
	- ERROR: The container is stuck in a loop waiting for the PostgreSQL database. The wait-for-it.sh script reports 'nc: command not found' on every iteration, indicating that the netcat utility required for the health check is missing inside the image. As a result, the script cannot verify that db:5432 is reachable and continuously prints 'Waiting for db:5432...' without progressing to the actual entrypoint, even though Docker reports the container state as running.
	- FIX: Add netcat (or a compatible nc binary) to the Confluence image so the wait‑for‑it script can perform its connectivity test. In the Dockerfile, after the existing apt‑get line, install the netcat‑openbsd package (or netcat‑traditional) with apt‑get install -y netcat‑openbsd and then clean the apt cache as before. This makes the nc command available, allowing the loop to detect when db:5432 is reachable and to hand off execution to /entrypoint.sh as intended. No other changes are required.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Confluence container is likely failing because the compose file overrides the image’s entrypoint with “/entrypoint.sh”, but the official atlassian/confluence‑server image stores its start‑up script under a different path (for example /opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start‑confluence.sh or /entrypoint.sh in the image root) and expects it to be invoked directly. Fix the problem by changing the entrypoint line to call the exact script that the base image provides (e.g., ["/usr/local/bin/wait‑for‑it.sh","db","5432","--","/opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start‑confluence.sh"] or whatever the correct path is) and ensure that script is executable; you can add a RUN chmod +x for that path in the Dockerfile if needed. After correcting the path, the wait‑for‑it wrapper will hand off to Confluence’s real entrypoint and the container should start normally.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The Confluence container is dying because the `wait‑for‑it.sh` wrapper is being invoked with an extra `--` token that the script doesn’t understand – after it parses the host and port it immediately tries to `exec "$@"`, so the first argument it receives is literally `--` and the real start‑up script never runs. Remove that placeholder and pass the Confluence start command directly to the wrapper. In `docker‑compose.yml` change the entrypoint line to:

```yaml
entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh","db","5432","/opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start-confluence.sh"]
```

With the `--` removed the wrapper will wait for PostgreSQL to become reachable and then correctly exec the Confluence start script, allowing the container to come up normally. No other changes are required because the base image already contains the start script and you’ve already installed `nc` (netcat‑openbsd) for the health‑check loop.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The most common cause of the failure is that the custom `entrypoint` replaces Confluence’s own start‑up logic with the wait‑for‑it wrapper, but the wrapper only runs the script you give it without preserving the original entrypoint arguments that the Atlassian image expects (such as JVM options and licensing flags). To fix it, remove the `entrypoint` line from the compose file and instead prepend the wait‑for‑it call to the default command, for example:

```yaml
command: ["/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh","db","5432","--","/opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start-confluence.sh"]
```

or run the wait‑for‑it script inside a simple shell wrapper:

```yaml
command: ["bash","-c","/usr/local/bin/wait-for-it.sh db 5432 && /opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start-confluence.sh"]
```

This lets the original Confluence entrypoint execute with all its required parameters after the database is healthy, and the container should start correctly. If you still need the explicit chmod, keep it, but the key change is using `command` instead of overriding the image’s built‑in entrypoint.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The container is failing because the custom command replaces the image’s original entrypoint, so the startup wrapper that sets up Confluence’s classpath and JVM options never runs. Change the compose file to keep the base image’s entrypoint and only prepend the wait‑for‑it step, for example by adding an entrypoint field that calls the script and then forwards to the original start command (or by using the “--” form of the command). Also make sure the wait‑for‑it script is executable and that the path to the Confluence start script matches the base image (e.g., /opt/atlassian/confluence/bin/start-confluence.sh). After updating the compose file to use the original entrypoint with the wait‑for‑it wrapper, the Confluence service should start correctly.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
