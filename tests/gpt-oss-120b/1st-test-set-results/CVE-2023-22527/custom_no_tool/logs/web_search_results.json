    "desc": "CVE\u20112023\u201122527 is a critical unauthenticated template\u2011injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data\u202fCenter. The flaw resides in the Velocity template endpoint `/template/aui/text-inline.vm` which evaluates attacker\u2011controlled OGNL expressions. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request, an attacker can cause the Confluence web application to execute arbitrary operating\u2011system commands via the Freemarker `Execute` utility. Successful exploitation gives the attacker full remote code execution on the host running Confluence, allowing complete system compromise. The vulnerability affects all self\u2011hosted Confluence releases prior to the patches released in December\u202f2023.",
