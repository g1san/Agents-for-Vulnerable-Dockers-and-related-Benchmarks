CVE description: CVE‑2020‑29599 is a vulnerability in the ImageMagick image‑processing suite (both the 6.x series earlier than version 6.9.11‑40 and the 7.x series earlier than version 7.0.10‑40). The flaw resides in the handling of the `-authenticate` command‑line option that is used for opening password‑protected PDF files (and also affects SVG processing). ImageMagick inserts the user‑supplied password into a shell command without proper escaping, allowing an attacker who can supply a crafted PDF (or SVG) file to inject arbitrary shell commands. When ImageMagick processes the malicious file, the injected commands are executed with the privileges of the ImageMagick process, resulting in remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability is triggered simply by invoking the ImageMagick `convert`, `magick`, `mogrify`, or similar utilities on untrusted files; no additional services are required.
Attack Type: remote code execution

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Docker setup does not install or reference ImageMagick. Neither the Dockerfile, the build image (node:14-alpine), nor the application code includes the 'imagemagick' package, so the required service is missing and no vulnerable version from the specified list can be detected.
	- ERROR: The Docker setup does not install or reference ImageMagick. Neither the Dockerfile, the build image (node:14-alpine), nor the application code includes the 'imagemagick' package, so the required service is missing and no vulnerable version from the specified list can be detected.
	- FIX: To resolve the missing ImageMagick dependency, update the app Dockerfile to install the ImageMagick binaries (for example, adding apk add --no‑cache imagemagick or using a specific vulnerable version via a package manager or by downloading the source tarball and compiling the 6.x or 7.x release that falls before 6.9.11‑40/7.0.10‑40). After installing the appropriate package, ensure the container’s runtime environment can invoke the convert or magick commands used in the demonstration endpoint, and optionally expose any required fonts or libraries so that PDF/SVG processing works correctly. This change adds the required service so the CVE‑2020‑29599 scenario can be reproduced.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the ImageMagick source compile step is missing a few libraries that the package’s configure script expects, so the `./configure` command aborts. Add the development packages for libxml2, freetype and libtool (or the generic `imagemagick-dev` set) before downloading the source, for example by changing the first RUN line in the Dockerfile to `RUN apk add --no-cache build-base wget libjpeg-turbo-dev libpng-dev libxml2-dev freetype-dev libtool` and then keep the rest of the commands unchanged; this satisfies the configure checks and lets `make && make install` complete, after which the rest of the image builds normally. If you prefer not to compile, you could also replace the source‑install block with `apk add imagemagick=6.9.11.60-r0` (pinning the vulnerable version) which eliminates the compile‑time errors altogether.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build fails because the Alpine base image is missing a few libraries and tools that ImageMagick’s configure script expects – most notably bash, pkg‑config, zlib‑dev and the development headers for libjpeg, libpng, libxml2 and freetype. Adding those packages before unpacking the source (for example `apk add --no-cache bash pkgconfig zlib-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev libpng-dev libxml2-dev freetype-dev libtool`) resolves the configure‑time errors, and then the existing `./configure --disable-shared && make && make install` steps will succeed. After installing the extra packages, you can keep the rest of the Dockerfile unchanged and the image will build correctly.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine image is missing a few libraries that ImageMagick’s configure script expects when it tries to add PDF/SVG support – most notably Ghostscript (and its development headers) plus the runtime linker cache update after the manual install. To fix it, amend the Dockerfile’s `apk add` line to include `ghostscript ghostscript-dev` (or just `ghostscript` if the headers are bundled) and then, after `make install`, run `ldconfig` so the newly installed libraries are discoverable. With those packages present and the linker cache refreshed, the `./configure && make && make install` sequence will complete and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #4 failed! See 'log4.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine‑based ImageMagick compilation expects a few tools that aren’t in the current apk list (for example `perl` and the GNU `ldconfig` utility) and because the final `ldconfig` call can’t run on musl‑based Alpine. To fix it, add the missing build‑time dependencies (`perl`, `autoconf`, `automake` and `gettext`) to the `apk add` line, drop the `ldconfig` command (it isn’t needed on Alpine), and keep the rest of the steps unchanged. After those changes the `wget → tar → ./configure → make → make install` sequence will complete and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #5 failed! See 'log5.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Dockerfile tries to compile ImageMagick from source on Alpine, but the required development libraries (especially the Ghostscript and libxml2 headers) are not fully satisfied and the configure script aborts; the simplest fix is to replace the source‑compile step with the Alpine package that already contains the exact vulnerable version. Change the Dockerfile to install the pre‑built ImageMagick package (e.g. `apk add --no-cache imagemagick=6.9.11.30-r0`) and add any missing runtime deps such as `ghostscript` and `libxml2-dev`, then delete the `wget…tar…configure…make` block. After that the rest of the Dockerfile (npm install, copy source, expose port) will run without error and the image will build successfully.


Test iteration #6 failed! See 'log6.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because the Alpine package manager cannot find the exact ImageMagick version you pinned ( 6.9.11.30‑r0 ) and some of the “‑dev” libraries you request are not available in the default repository; to fix it, edit the Dockerfile so the `apk add` line installs the generic `imagemagick` package together with the runtime libraries (e.g., `ghostscript libxml2 libjpeg-turbo libpng freetype`) without the “‑dev” suffix or a strict version tag, optionally adding `apk update` beforehand, then rebuild the image. This change resolves the missing‑package errors while still providing a vulnerable ImageMagick build for the CVE demonstration.


Test iteration #7 failed! See 'log7.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The logs show that after the initial database initialization and execution of the init.sql script, PostgreSQL received a fast shutdown request and stopped ('LOG: received fast shutdown request', 'server stopped', 'database system is shut down'). This indicates that the database server is not running, so the container is not providing the expected service despite the inspect state reporting Running:true. The container therefore is not operating correctly.
	- ERROR: The logs show that after the initial database initialization and execution of the init.sql script, PostgreSQL received a fast shutdown request and stopped ('LOG: received fast shutdown request', 'server stopped', 'database system is shut down'). This indicates that the database server is not running, so the container is not providing the expected service despite the inspect state reporting Running:true. The container therefore is not operating correctly.
	- FIX: The shutdown happens because the PostgreSQL container is failing during its initialization – the bind‑mount of `./db/init.sql` overwrites the entry‑point directory with a file that the postgres user cannot read (or is placed in the wrong location), causing the server to abort and Docker reports a fast shutdown. Fix it by mounting the initialization script into the correct sub‑directory **as a read‑only bind** (e.g., `./db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro`) and ensure the file’s ownership is `postgres:postgres` (or simply copy it inside the image instead of bind‑mounting). After that the container will start normally, the `db` service will stay up, and the app will be able to connect to it.


Test iteration #8 failed! See 'log8.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The logs show that the PostgreSQL server was initialized, started, accepted connections, and then immediately received a fast shutdown request, after which the server stopped and the init process completed. This indicates the database process is not running anymore. Although Docker inspect reports the container state as "running", the PostgreSQL service inside has terminated, no port is bound (IPAddress is empty), and therefore the container is not correctly serving the database.
	- ERROR: The logs show that the PostgreSQL server was initialized, started, accepted connections, and then immediately received a fast shutdown request, after which the server stopped and the init process completed. This indicates the database process is not running anymore. Although Docker inspect reports the container state as "running", the PostgreSQL service inside has terminated, no port is bound (IPAddress is empty), and therefore the container is not correctly serving the database.
	- FIX: The PostgreSQL container is exiting because the image’s default entrypoint is being overridden or interrupted by the custom Dockerfile – the only thing it does is copy the init script and change its ownership, which replaces the upstream `docker-entrypoint.sh` logic that launches the server in the foreground. To keep the database running you should let the official image’s entrypoint run unchanged (or explicitly start the server), expose the PostgreSQL port, and optionally add a restart policy. In practice you can remove any stray `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` lines from the custom Dockerfile (the file you have already doesn’t add any, but the `chown` step can be done without changing the image) and add `EXPOSE 5432` plus a `restart: unless-stopped` entry in the compose service; this will cause the container to start postgres in the foreground and stay alive, making the DB reachable from the app.


Test iteration #9 failed! See 'log9.txt' for details.
	- NOT VULNERABLE VERSION (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Dockerfile for the app image installs ImageMagick via Alpine 3.12 packages (apk add imagemagick). The version provided by the Alpine 3.12 repository is ImageMagick 7.0.9‑27 (or a similar 7.0.9‑xx release). This version is not present in the allowed list ['6.9.9-15', '6.9.10-23', '6.9.10-31', '6.9.11-0', '6.9.11-30', '7.0.8-27', '7.0.9-12', '7.0.9-20', '7.0.10-0', '7.0.10-30'], so the code_hard_version milestone is not met. The image does include ImageMagick, satisfying the services_ok milestone.
