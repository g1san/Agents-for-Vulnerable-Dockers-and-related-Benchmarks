    "desc": "CVE\u20112020\u201129599 is a vulnerability in the ImageMagick image\u2011processing suite (both the 6.x series earlier than version 6.9.11\u201140 and the 7.x series earlier than version 7.0.10\u201140). The flaw resides in the handling of the `-authenticate` command\u2011line option that is used for opening password\u2011protected PDF files (and also affects SVG processing). ImageMagick inserts the user\u2011supplied password into a shell command without proper escaping, allowing an attacker who can supply a crafted PDF (or SVG) file to inject arbitrary shell commands. When ImageMagick processes the malicious file, the injected commands are executed with the privileges of the ImageMagick process, resulting in remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability is triggered simply by invoking the ImageMagick `convert`, `magick`, `mogrify`, or similar utilities on untrusted files; no additional services are required.",
