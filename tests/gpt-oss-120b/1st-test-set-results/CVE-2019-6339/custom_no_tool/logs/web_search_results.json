    "desc": "CVE\u20112019\u20116339 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core. The flaw resides in the handling of file\u2011system paths that may contain a PHP PHAR stream wrapper (phar://). An attacker who can supply a crafted PHAR archive via an uploaded file and then set the Temporary directory configuration to point to that archive can cause PHP to deserialize malicious metadata, executing arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability affects Drupal 7.x versions prior to 7.62 and Drupal 8.x versions prior to 8.5.9 and 8.6.6 (including the specific ranges 8.5.0\u20118.5.5 and 8.6.0\u20118.6.9). Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control over the affected host, allowing data theft, site defacement, or further network intrusion.",
