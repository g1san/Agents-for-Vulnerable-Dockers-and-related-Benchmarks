CVE description: CVE‑2019‑6339 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Drupal core. The flaw resides in the handling of file‑system paths that may contain a PHP PHAR stream wrapper (phar://). An attacker who can supply a crafted PHAR archive via an uploaded file and then set the Temporary directory configuration to point to that archive can cause PHP to deserialize malicious metadata, executing arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability affects Drupal 7.x versions prior to 7.62 and Drupal 8.x versions prior to 8.5.9 and 8.6.6 (including the specific ranges 8.5.0‑8.5.5 and 8.6.0‑8.6.9). Successful exploitation gives the attacker full control over the affected host, allowing data theft, site defacement, or further network intrusion.
Attack Type: Remote code execution
Services (format: [SERVICE-DEPENDENCY-TYPE][SERVICE-NAME][SERVICE-VERSIONS] SERVICE-DESCRIPTION):
- [HARD][drupal][['7.58', '7.59', '7.60', '7.61', '8.5.0', '8.5.1', '8.5.2', '8.5.3', '8.5.4', '8.5.5', '8.5.6', '8.5.7', '8.5.8', '8.6.0', '8.6.1', '8.6.2', '8.6.3', '8.6.4', '8.6.5', '8.6.6', '8.6.7', '8.6.8', '8.6.9']] Core Drupal service containing the vulnerable PHAR stream wrapper handling. Specific versions listed are those known to be vulnerable to CVE‑2019‑6339.
- [SOFT-WEB][nginx][['1.24']] Web server that serves the Drupal application.
- [SOFT][php][['7.4-fpm']] PHP runtime required by Drupal to execute PHP code.

Test iteration #0 failed! See 'log0.txt' for details.
	- CONTAINER FAILURE (Manual Check):
	- ERROR: one of the containers of my Docker system is not running correctly.
	- FIX: The web image is built from php:5.6‑apache, which does not include the mysqli extension needed by the PHP script and is also far older than the PHP 7.4 runtime expected by Drupal; updating the Dockerfile to use php:7.4‑apache (or a later supported version) and adding a docker‑php‑ext‑install mysqli step will resolve the startup failure, after which the rest of the compose file can remain unchanged.


Test iteration #1 failed! See 'log1.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The drupal service maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default HTTP port 80, so it is not accessible via the expected default network port. Additionally, the MySQL database service does not expose its default port 3306 at all, preventing external access on the standard port. Therefore the network setup does not meet the default port requirements.
	- ERROR: The drupal service maps its internal port 80 to host port 8080 instead of the default HTTP port 80, so it is not accessible via the expected default network port. Additionally, the MySQL database service does not expose its default port 3306 at all, preventing external access on the standard port. Therefore the network setup does not meet the default port requirements.
	- FIX: To make the services use the standard ports, modify the docker‑compose file so the Drupal container maps its internal port 80 to the host’s port 80 (change `"8080:80"` to `"80:80"`), and add a ports entry for the MySQL service exposing port 3306 (for example `- "3306:3306"`). Optionally adjust the Nginx proxy to listen on the same host port (keep it on 80) so requests flow from Nginx to Drupal without needing a non‑standard port. These changes align the container networking with the expected default ports.


Test iteration #2 failed! See 'log2.txt' for details.
	- IMAGE BUILDING FAILURE (Manual Check)
	- ERROR: my Docker systems terminates its execution because of an error while building one of its images.
	- FIX: The build is failing because both the drupal and nginx services try to bind host port 80, which creates a port‑collision error; to fix it you should remove the “80:80” mapping from the drupal service (or change it to a different host port such as 8080) and let only the nginx container expose port 80 to the host, since it already proxies requests to the internal drupal service. After adjusting the port mapping, restart the compose stack and the containers will start without the bind conflict.


Test iteration #3 failed! See 'log3.txt' for details.
	- WRONG NETWORK SETUP (LLM-as-a-Judge Check): The Drupal container runs the web server on its default port 80 but does not expose any host port mapping (no "ports" entry). While it is reachable internally by the Nginx container, the milestone requires each service to be set up on its default network port for external access. Therefore the network setup milestone is not met.
	- ERROR: The Drupal container runs the web server on its default port 80 but does not expose any host port mapping (no "ports" entry). While it is reachable internally by the Nginx container, the milestone requires each service to be set up on its default network port for external access. Therefore the network setup milestone is not met.
	- FIX: To meet the milestone, add a ports mapping for the Drupal service so its internal port 80 is bound to the host, e.g. under the drupal service include `ports: - "8080:80"` (or `"80:80"` if you want to use the same host port). This exposes Drupal directly on the default HTTP port (or an alternate host port) while keeping the existing internal network connectivity for Nginx. No other changes are required for the network setup.


Docker is running correctly with 3 containers!
